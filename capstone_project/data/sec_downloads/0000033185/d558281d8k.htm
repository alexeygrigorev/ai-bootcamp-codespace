&#147;Company&#148;) appointed, effective April&nbsp;16, 2018, Mark W. Begor as Chief Executive Officer of the Company and as a director. Upon the effective date of Mr.&nbsp;Begor&#146;s appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Paulino do Rego
Barros, Jr., interim Chief Executive Officer, will step down from that role. The Company expects that Mr.&nbsp;Barros will assist Mr.&nbsp;Begor in his transition to Chief Executive Officer until Mr.&nbsp;Barros&#146;s expected retirement in early
2019. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><U>Biographical Information for Mr.&nbsp;Begor </U></P>

Warburg Pincus, a global private equity investment firm, since June 2016. Prior to Warburg Pincus, Mr.&nbsp;Begor spent 35&nbsp;years at General Electric Company (&#147;GE&#148;), a global industrial and financial services company, in a variety of
operating and financial roles. During his career at GE, Mr.&nbsp;Begor served in a variety of roles leading multibillion dollar units of the company, including President and CEO of GE Energy Management from 2014 to 2016, President and CEO of GE
Capital Real Estate from 2011 to 2014, and President and CEO of GE Capital Retail Finance (Synchrony Financial) from 2002 to 2011. Mr.&nbsp;Begor has served on the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) board of directors since 2016. In determining that
Mr.&nbsp;Begor should be appointed as a director, the Board considered that it is important to have the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer also serve on its Board. </P>

Agreement&#148;). The term of the Employment Agreement will commence on April&nbsp;16, 2018, and will continue until terminated in accordance with its terms. Under the Employment Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Begor&#146;s base salary is $1.5&nbsp;million,
subject to increase, but not decrease, by the Board or the Compensation, Human Resources and Management Succession Committee (the &#147;Compensation Committee&#148;), and he is eligible for an annual incentive bonus of 100% of his annual base salary
(the &#147;Target Annual Bonus Opportunity&#148;) with a maximum payout of 200% of annual base salary, depending on the achievement of performance criteria established by the Board. For 2018, Mr.&nbsp;Begor&#146;s Target Annual Bonus Opportunity
will be <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">pro-rated.</FONT> </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under the Employment Agreement, Mr.&nbsp;Begor will be granted an initial equity award with a
value of $7&nbsp;million, consisting of (i) $3.5&nbsp;million in performance shares, (ii) $1.75&nbsp;million in time-based restricted stock units and (iii) $1.75&nbsp;million in stock options. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Begor will be awarded a <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-time</FONT> special grant in the amount of $10&nbsp;million, comprised of equity awards in the same proportions as the initial equity award above (the &#147;Special Award&#148;). Mr.&nbsp;Begor will be eligible to
receive additional equity grants beginning in 2019, as determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion, provided that the total value at grant will be at least $7&nbsp;million annually. Mr.&nbsp;Begor&#146;s equity
awards, other than his Special Award, will be subject to the Company&#146;s enhanced clawback policy. Under this enhanced policy, the Board may recover incentive compensation awarded to employees in the event of misconduct or failure of oversight
that results in significant financial or reputational harm. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Begor will participate in the Company&#146;s incentive, savings, retirement and

planning and tax preparation services allowance. </P>
