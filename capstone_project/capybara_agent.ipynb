            "1. **Habitat Loss**: Capybaras face significant threats from habitat destruction, primarily due to agricultural expansion and urban development. As their natural environments are altered or destroyed, their populations decline.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Hunting**: They are hunted for their meat and skin, which poses a direct threat to their survival. This hunting pressure can be especially intense in regions where they are considered a food source.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Competition with Livestock**: As agricultural practices grow, capybaras may experience increased competition for resources like food and water from livestock.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Environmental Changes**: Changes in environmental conditions, possibly influenced by climate change, can further stress capybara populations by altering their habitats and availability of essential resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Exotic Trade**: Capybaras are sometimes captured for the exotic pet trade, which can threaten local populations by removing individuals from the wild.\n",

            "These factors collectively contribute to a reduction in capybara populations, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect their habitats and manage hunting practices effectively.\n",
