They are semi-aquatic mammals found near rivers, lakes, and wetlands in groups. Capybaras have webbed feet, long bodies, and a short stout head, adapted for swimming. They are herbivorous, feeding on grasses and aquatic plants, and are social animals, often living in groups of 10-20 individuals. Capybaras are known for their friendly disposition and are often kept as pets. They have few natural predators but can be hunted by jaguars, caimans, and anacondas.\n",

It inhabits wetland areas, particularly in Brazil and Colombia. This species is smaller than the common capybara and has a more limited range. The Lesser capybara plays a role in its ecosystem, particularly in the dispersal of aquatic plants.\n",

They are the largest living rodents and are native to South America, inhabiting savannas and dense forests near water sources.\n",

            "3. **Neochoerus (extinct genus related to capybaras)**: Neochoerus is an extinct genus of caviid rodents that lived during the Late Miocene through the Pleistocene epoch in North America. They were close relatives of modern capybaras and are known primarily from fossil remains. Their morphology suggests adaptations for a semi-aquatic lifestyle similar to those of their living relatives.\n",

They belonged to the family Caviidae and are thought to be closely related to modern capybaras. Caviodon lived during the Late Miocene, and its fossil remains indicate morphological traits that align with adaptations seen in contemporary capybaras.\n",
