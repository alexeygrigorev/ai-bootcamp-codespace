This incident led to operational disruptions at the domestic properties for a duration of nine days. Key details include:\n- **Nature of the Incident:** Unauthorized access, classified as a “Cybersecurity Issue.”\n- **When it Occurred:** September 2023.\n- **Impact or Scope:** The intrusion resulted in the shutdown of certain systems which affected business operations, including digital room keys and slot machines, thereby adversely impacting adjusted property earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDAR) around that period.\n- **Information Compromised:** Personal information of some customers was accessed, including names, contact details, and in limited cases, Social Security numbers and passport numbers. Notably, customer payment card information was not accessed.\n- **Filing Date and Form Type:** Form 10-Q filed November 8, 2023: “In September 2023, we identified a cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access…The Cybersecurity Issue, together with the incident response efforts discussed above, resulted in some disruptions to our business operations...” and details on legal implications from consumer class actions.\n\n### Risk Factors\nThe company's filings highlight several cybersecurity-related risks, including:\n- Ongoing cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities that traditional security measures may not fully mitigate.\n- Dependence on third-party vendors and information systems, creating exposure to similar cybersecurity risks with entities they cannot fully control.\n- Potential reputational damage and financial implications arising from data breaches, compliance violations, and resultant legal actions.\n\n### Security Measures and Improvements\nMGM Resorts mentions several controls and initiatives to strengthen its cybersecurity posture:\n- Continuous reviews and updates of security measures against evolving threats.\n- An established cybersecurity incident response plan to manage and mitigate effects from potential security events.\n- Regular oversight by an Audit Committee, which receives updates from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) on cybersecurity risks and incidents.\n\n### Filing Timeline\n- **Form 10-Q filed November 8, 2023:** MGM disclosed a cybersecurity incident affecting certain systems, operational disruptions, and legal repercussions.\n- **Form 10-K filed February 23, 2024:** Further details on cybersecurity risks and controls are outlined, including ongoing assessments and improvements to incident management protocols.\n\n---\n\n### Implications for Business Continuity to Operations VP\nThe ransomware attack's significant impact on operational capacity, evidenced by disruptions in essential services at the properties, underscores a crucial need for effective contingency planning. Continuous operational vulnerabilities can lead to revenue loss and damage customer trust. It is essential for the operations team to fortify disaster recovery plans and ensure redundancy in critical systems to minimize downtime and sustain customer service levels during similar incidents.\n\n### Tier 1 vs Tier 2 Supplier Risk Assessment\n- **Tier 1 Suppliers**: Given that key operational services (like digital key technology and related systems) were disrupted, assessing Tier 1 vendors whose systems interface directly with MGM's core operations is crucial. Their cybersecurity posture impacts MGM's operational integrity significantly, necessitating stringent vetting and ongoing monitoring.\n- **Tier 2 Suppliers**: These vendors may be less directly involved but still support critical functions (e.g., maintenance and software updates). While their impact is more peripheral, any security lapses could trigger cascading failures downward the supply chain, warranting thorough risk assessments to understand and manage potential vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summary, MGM's recent cybersecurity incidents necessitate a focused examination of supplier relationships, ensuring both Tier 1 and Tier 2 supply chains are fortified against similar assaults to uphold operational integrity.",
