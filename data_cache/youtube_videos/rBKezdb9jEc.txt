0:00 yeah hi everyone thanks for joining us
0:02 today
0:03 so this event is brought to you by data
0:05 talks club which is a community of
0:07 people who love
0:08 talking about data and this is one of
0:10 the weekly events that we have
0:12 so we have actually two weekly events
0:15 one that we have today
0:16 is uh more like a live discussion we
0:19 call it live podcast
0:20 where we talk about different topics
0:22 without slides
0:23 and well this is the only slice you have
0:26 at the beginning but then there are no
0:28 slides
0:29 and if you want to find out more about
0:31 events you can go to our website
0:34 datatalks.com slash events
0:37 and a little spoiler i'm going to tweet
0:40 that
0:43 so and then uh yeah so you can see
0:47 the events we uh planned for the future
0:51 so next week we will just have one event
0:53 now
0:54 we will talk about data science for
0:56 social good and then next friday we will
0:58 take a break
0:59 in germany for those who are not in
1:00 germany in germany
1:02 next friday is public holiday so many
1:06 people will be taking vacation and then
1:08 we will
1:10 have one week after that we will be
1:12 talking about a similar topic to what we
1:14 will be talking today
1:15 shifting career from analytics to data
1:17 science
1:18 so stay tuned check our events
1:22 and yeah the best way to stay up to date
1:27 with our events is uh subscribing to our
1:30 newsletter
1:31 and then joining our slack and you can
1:34 also subscribe to our youtube channel
1:35 and then
1:36 you will get notifications each time a

2:00 link for asking any questions you want
2:03 and i will try to to bring these
2:06 questions during our discussion so
2:09 that's all
2:10 now i am going to make that tweet that
2:12 you saw
2:15 okay it just happened
2:19 and yeah are you ready to start
2:22 sure so
2:26 this week we will be we will talk about
2:29 transitioning from project management to
2:31 data science
2:33 and we have a special guest today xenia
2:36 is currently working as a data science
2:38 manager at momox
2:40 and after four years working as a
2:41 project manager she turned her careers
2:44 a career towards data science she spent
2:47 four
2:47 three years researching fraud and
2:50 analytic detection techniques
2:52 and she earned a degree in data
2:54 analytics welcome
2:55 xenia hello everyone it's a pleasure to
2:58 be here thank you
3:00 yeah so um before we start before we go
3:03 to
3:04 our main topic uh can you tell us about
3:06 your
3:07 career journey yeah sure just a couple
3:10 of words to understand
3:11 uh what my background uh so uh in 2013 i
3:15 got
3:16 a fundamental education in mars
3:19 in russia and quite prominent university
3:22 and then i got another
3:23 management degree in 2014 then i spent
3:27 four years as alexia mentioned in
3:29 project management
3:30 and i have been working and managing
3:33 project in
3:34 e-services governmental services
3:36 traveling telecom
3:38 and other fields then i
3:41 acquired another degree master's degree
3:44 in information system management that
3:45 also
3:46 alexa mentioned and in parallel i am
3:49 i'm i was doing a research uh for three
3:52 years
3:53 and i will explain about it later on
3:56 in future details i think it's important
3:58 for for our topic today
4:00 and then i'm working as a data scientist
4:03 since 2019
4:05 already for two years and currently i'm
4:07 working in
4:09 momocs and i shifted my focus from front
4:12 detection to
4:13 marketing and currently i'm applying
4:15 data science technique in marketing
4:17 and it's quite entertaining and i really
4:21 like
4:21 uh this field so far and there are a lot
4:24 of optimization challenges a lot of
4:27 things to
4:29 to predict and improve and it's it's
4:31 really nice
4:32 place and position to work
4:35 yeah thanks so uh i'm curious
4:39 so data science is such a field that
4:42 attracts
4:43 many people from quite different
4:45 backgrounds um
4:46 for example i am software engineer many
4:48 data and uh people who are working
4:50 in data analytics also go into data
4:53 science and then sometimes project
4:54 managers
4:56 like yourself get interested
4:59 in this field so i'm curious how did it
5:02 happen
5:02 for you what what motivated you to
5:07 to to start going to
5:10 like when you realize that machine
5:12 learning is such an interesting
5:13 field how did it happen yeah this
5:17 uh question that i have heard so many
5:18 times and probably i will rephrase it
5:21 uh basically before going to machine
5:23 learning i realized that data analysis
5:25 basically is super interesting for me
5:27 because
5:27 when i have been working in project
5:30 management
5:31 i worked close to development and
5:34 my work was associated with decision
5:36 making
5:37 and i was curious every time when i make
5:41 some decision
5:42 uh is it right or not and why should i
5:44 decide it and how should
5:46 how can i decide it i don't know right
5:48 and at those time
5:50 the such concept as know your customers
5:53 uh principle in marketing
5:54 and also customer-centric um
5:58 way of thinking has been developed and
6:00 integrated in businesses
6:02 and people start to learn what actually
6:05 customers want
6:07 and it's of course associated with a lot
6:09 of data that
6:10 companies has towards their products
6:13 and you can analyze it and it would be
6:17 like not smart to not use this data
6:20 and at those time i realized that i want
6:23 to make a decision
6:24 uh which would improve product but based
6:27 on the customer's
6:28 preferences because it's not me who
6:30 decide what direction
6:32 of product should go but this customer
6:34 who actually drives
6:35 this business and who consumes this
6:37 product and i think it's super important
6:39 to analyze data
6:40 and to understand the sense out of this
6:43 and
6:44 what your customer wants that's how i
6:47 get into the data analysis and that's
6:49 why i became interested in this
6:51 field so basically
6:56 you worked as a project manager and you
6:59 needed to make a lot of decisions
7:01 and then usually to make these decisions
7:03 you would rely on data
7:05 and you realize okay analyzing data is
7:08 such an interesting thing and you
7:10 first got into data analytics more for
7:13 for supporting your decisions for
7:15 supporting this decision making process
7:18 right and then uh like after that uh
7:21 uh like
7:25 this transition from data analytics to
7:27 more machine learning and data science
7:30 yeah i would say this is a next step
7:31 when you really analyze data and you
7:33 feel comfortable with this when you
7:35 learn some packages to analyze data to
7:37 visualize data to deliver your findings
7:40 and also interpret it on the business
7:41 level
7:42 then you uh start interested in becoming
7:45 interested in
7:46 okay what next uh okay i derive this
7:49 knowledge
7:50 but what my customer will do next and i
7:53 personally
7:54 think and it's not my uh view but it's
7:57 like
7:57 data analysis is small focus on
7:59 historical data and derives a sense
8:01 of what your customers did or how your
8:03 business went so far
8:05 and data science is forecasting uh
8:09 the future so you try to predict what's
8:10 going on and
8:12 i think that you probably can't go to
8:14 data science without transitioning this
8:16 part through data analytics and
8:18 data analysis is the main part of
8:21 not main but part definitely of any data
8:25 science project
8:26 because you have to analyze your data
8:28 just to
8:29 build your hypothesis on top of what you
8:31 observed
8:33 yeah and so you already so we had a
8:36 question what is the difference between
8:38 data analytics and data science
8:40 and they think you just you just cover
8:41 that
8:43 so yeah i don't think there is much to
8:45 add to that right
8:48 and if somebody decides to
8:51 study data science um how do they
8:55 like for you how did it happen so you
8:58 realized okay there is a lot of
8:59 potential in data
9:00 right so i need to analyze this data i
9:02 need to understand what's going on
9:05 how did you decide which things to study
9:08 to
9:08 to be able to do this yeah this
9:11 uh i i tried uh firstly i tried to
9:15 search through the internet by myself
9:17 and just find some courses on udacity
9:20 on udemy and uh corsair and so on
9:23 um but soon if you do the same you will
9:26 figure out that the
9:27 uh amount of knowledge is immense and
9:30 you kind of lost where to start and
9:34 i felt the same uh at my time when i
9:38 started to approach this topic and but
9:41 my benefit was that i already got
9:44 familiar with math statistics
9:46 probability theory
9:47 and every these fundamental things that
9:49 you need for data science
9:51 but anyway i uh think that you have to
9:55 come
9:55 uh out of your background
9:58 because if you try to transit
10:02 if you try to shift your career from
10:04 back-end developer
10:05 uh developments probably you are already
10:07 experiencing coding you know engineering
10:10 stuff and so on so probably you wanted
10:13 to
10:14 learn some packages for data analysis
10:16 and also improve your statistical
10:17 knowledge
10:18 something like this and if you come from
10:21 data analysis another cool information
10:24 that you have to pick up before
10:26 so you have to understand your strengths
10:29 then realize
10:30 what what is lacking for you in your
10:33 skill set
10:34 and then add it up to your profile
10:37 for me it was like i really
10:41 fond of fundamental things and i already
10:44 got two degrees and i decided okay
10:46 why not get the third one because that's
10:48 what
10:49 that's why i choose my path and yeah
10:52 okay so you mentioned i think if i
10:55 understood correctly so you mentioned
10:56 that for you you already had this
10:58 mathematical background you already
11:00 knew statistics uh is it something you
11:03 needed to use
11:04 as a project manager or this is
11:06 something that was uh
11:07 you you learned during your studies yeah
11:11 i was i was just lucky
11:12 that i got math as my first degree
11:16 and it was i would not say that at 17
11:20 years old i i definitely knew what i
11:22 wanted
11:22 to do for my life and knew what to learn
11:25 and so on
11:26 my math degree was uh chosen and
11:29 i learned it uh i probably did not use
11:32 it
11:33 so extensively in my project management
11:35 career so far
11:36 but i'm really grateful that i had in my
11:39 background because it helped me a lot
11:41 when i got into this uh data analytics
11:44 degree
11:45 uh and it was super useful i i knew all
11:48 of this stuff
11:48 and the main thing was just to remember
11:50 it from from
11:52 from bottom of my head and yeah
11:55 okay so you started mathematics during
11:57 your bachelor
11:59 then you uh worked as a project
12:01 management
12:02 manager right and then you got into data
12:05 analytics
12:06 and then you started to learn all these
12:08 things and uh you realized okay
12:11 this stuff that i learned at university
12:13 was actually very useful
12:14 yeah but it it it wasn't it it wasn't
12:17 like this purely because
12:18 the reality like okay i know math and
12:22 i it's it's like my strengths and
12:25 how i can improve my profile based on
12:28 this so i don't want to just waste
12:31 what i already have so and data analysis
12:34 and machine learning was based on what i
12:36 already have
12:37 basically i want to extend my knowledge
12:39 so
12:40 it it wasn't like spontaneous decision
12:42 of course i realized it
12:43 i i will need mars for this and oh okay
12:46 i know it already
12:47 so so you but i guess math is not the
12:51 only thing you needed right
12:52 for that definitely in addition to
12:55 mathematics you also needed to
12:57 what kind of uh what are the other
12:59 things you needed to pick
13:00 yeah you definitely need engineering
13:02 skills and
13:03 ability to code i think it's super
13:06 important and
13:07 we will cover this later on uh another
13:10 thing
13:11 you need to analyze data because
13:14 mathematics is just their theory
13:18 but when you when it comes to practice
13:20 you really have to get this feeling
13:22 of how why you need it and how you can
13:25 apply it and
13:26 it's also skills that you have to
13:28 acquire and train
13:30 and uh the
13:33 another thing that i also find quite
13:35 important is the main expertise
13:37 so when you work as a data science
13:39 scientist you are not working in space
13:42 yeah it's in the middle of nowhere
13:43 you're working on specific fields
13:45 and you also have to study it and it
13:48 would be also
13:49 nice if you know business kpis if you
13:52 know what you want to achieve in
13:53 business terms
13:54 and so on so this what definitely
13:57 has to be learned yeah okay
14:01 uh yes so you
14:04 you tried to learn this uh you also
14:06 mentioned you tried to
14:07 pick up these skills uh uh online
14:11 by trying to do courses on your damn
14:13 udemy udacity
14:15 but it was just too too much information
14:17 too many courses
14:19 it was too difficult to choose what to
14:21 to learn and you decided to go
14:23 uh to get a masters for this reason yeah
14:26 yeah because i think that these people
14:29 they are professional
14:30 and education right so they definitely
14:33 should know how to
14:34 teach people and uh i think that
14:37 the main reasons that they can summarize
14:40 uh why it's worth to go to master
14:43 degree it's first of all it's deep
14:46 enough
14:47 uh you probably can
14:50 from from university you can the deepest
14:52 knowledge as you can find
14:54 or in books by yourself but it would be
14:57 difficult more difficult i would say
14:59 then just
14:59 go to lecture and to get these buzzwords
15:02 get this feeling and understand uh the
15:05 concept and so on from people that you
15:07 can ask
15:08 and this is super cool so deep enough uh
15:12 well structured uh because people who
15:15 construct this
15:16 uh study plan for you they thought
15:18 before
15:19 uh what should be covered in what order
15:22 and when you start to
15:23 um to trace some websites and internet
15:26 you probably can be lost in
15:28 understanding what you should study
15:30 before
15:31 and next to not be lost in this
15:33 information
15:34 so it should be sequential your learning
15:37 plan should be sequential and
15:38 university should know how to do this
15:41 then
15:42 definitely you have to experience the
15:44 increasing level of complexity
15:46 because if you just straight away dive
15:49 into
15:50 neural networks and deep learning you
15:52 probably
15:53 can feel overwhelmed uh or even
15:56 demotivated to to proceed because it's
15:59 quite difficult to start with
16:01 and that's another benefit of going to
16:03 university because it's structured
16:05 for for you in this increasing pace
16:09 then feedback that i already mentioned
16:12 so you have some ex you have to do some
16:14 exercises you can ask for feedback and
16:16 so on
16:16 and another thing that i find
16:20 uh really cool here in germany during my
16:23 study i got a position in research
16:25 laboratory
16:26 and i spent three years during my study
16:30 as a researcher
16:31 and i was lucky that i studied something
16:33 in in lecturing course and i immediately
16:36 applied
16:37 to the practice and it was so beneficial
16:39 because if you
16:40 learn something and you don't apply it
16:42 straight away
16:43 it's probably it will be fade out
16:48 out of your head and it's a pity you
16:50 have to learn it
16:51 again and again in the future uh so this
16:55 this why i chose degree okay and
16:59 uh what things did you study so i
17:01 understood the benefits uh
17:03 it's very hard to argue with these
17:04 benefits but i'm wondering what concrete
17:07 things you
17:08 you studied at university
17:11 perhaps like the most useful things in
17:13 your opinion
17:15 subjects or courses because i
17:19 knew that i want to go towards data
17:21 science career
17:22 and in universities there were a lot of
17:25 freedom to choose
17:26 and i have chosen the most
17:29 the hardest courses i would say because
17:33 yeah i was really interested in it i
17:34 choose two machine learning classes
17:36 uh like supervised and unsupervised
17:40 then two artificial intelligence classes
17:42 they are quite different but they speak
17:44 about the same
17:45 problems but from different angles then
17:48 multivariate analysis
17:49 statistics time series analysis graph
17:52 theory
17:53 networks analysis and all this
17:55 mathematical stuff
17:58 i felt that i i knew mars
18:01 and probably i can tackle those courses
18:04 and
18:04 yeah so it was quite uh
18:09 focused on data science right so because
18:11 you could select the courses you wanted
18:14 so you you knew what you wanted to study
18:16 and you
18:17 picked up courses that you thought that
18:20 will be super useful for your career
18:22 like machine learning artificial
18:23 intelligence statistics and
18:26 yeah because in my from my previous
18:28 experience as a project manager i absorb
18:30 the problems
18:30 i i i know what business needs or at
18:33 least have an impression that they know
18:34 it
18:35 and i try to base my choice of courses
18:37 based on
18:38 what i observed in the business so it's
18:40 it's also another benefit
18:42 to go to mass program after having some
18:44 experience
18:45 because you kind of understand what you
18:48 will be
18:49 resolving uh later on in the work and
18:51 why you have to choose
18:53 this or that yeah so i can already see
18:56 how your
18:57 uh background as project manager was
18:59 useful
19:00 yeah it feels like it was very carefully
19:03 planned
19:03 uh like the the way you approached your
19:06 studies uh
19:07 uh like you you knew what you wanted to
19:10 to do and
19:11 you just went for this so that's uh
19:13 that's uh that's really cool
19:15 um and um yeah i i know we already
19:18 talked about
19:19 uh online courses um and you perhaps had
19:22 the chance to compare these online
19:24 courses and
19:26 [Music]
19:27 the courses you took at university what
19:29 is your opinion like how they are
19:32 different and what worked better for you
19:36 yeah probably here i can even give
19:38 advices to people
19:39 who are interested and probably choose
19:42 between
19:42 having none a degree online and going to
19:46 university
19:47 um i have some experience in it uh
19:50 basically
19:50 useful courses uh it's um
19:54 uh it depends on your purpose here uh
19:57 always
19:58 and if you want to pick up some
20:00 knowledge about some specific
20:02 uh package to analyze or visualize data
20:05 it's enough to just go to code academy
20:08 and just speak the first
20:10 course that explains you this semantic
20:12 and
20:13 to to give some example and you just
20:15 learn it immediately for one or two
20:17 evenings
20:18 it's another story but if you really
20:20 want to understand the deep
20:21 um nature of of data science concept and
20:25 so on
20:26 um i would i can recommend you some nice
20:29 uh courses online courses that help me i
20:32 didn't do it during my university
20:34 because uh during the study i took a lot
20:37 of classes and also i
20:38 i worked as a researcher and i had an
20:41 enough practice
20:42 and knowledge and knowledge to consume
20:45 and people to ask
20:46 it was a full learning process but after
20:50 and when i graduated i realized that
20:52 okay sometimes
20:53 when you do some one thing you might
20:56 forget
20:57 something else and you have to refresh
20:59 your knowledge and what i prefer
21:01 i am doing some classes on machine
21:02 learning every year
21:04 uh just to refresh knowledge about
21:06 everything
21:07 and because usually at work you don't
21:09 use everything that you learned
21:11 but it's still important to have in mind
21:13 and
21:14 i personally find this fundamental
21:17 online class
21:18 what i could recommend there is a open
21:20 data science community
21:22 and they provide i know definitely once
21:25 per year
21:28 this online course and designed by
21:31 yuri kashnicki a super
21:34 well structured course which get your
21:37 deep understanding of the algorithm and
21:39 also provide a lot of practice
21:41 and you can communicate with
21:44 tutors and also get feedbacks and
21:47 you also communicate with peers and
21:50 learn from them i personally really like
21:53 it
21:54 and guys did nice nice courses
21:57 completely for free
21:58 so okay i'm googling it right now it's
22:01 called mlcourse.ai
22:03 so i will put it now in the chat
22:07 yes i also took that course and this is
22:09 amazing and i also took this course when
22:12 i was already working
22:13 uh as a data scientist and uh definitely
22:16 like when it comes to
22:18 uh to this uh understanding
22:21 of different algorithms i think this is
22:24 a really great course
22:26 oh i repeated your experience just
22:29 unconsciously yeah so
22:34 we already i already mentioned that i
22:36 think your background as a project
22:38 manager really helped you at least in
22:40 structuring uh the way you approached
22:44 your education like deciding which
22:46 courses to take
22:47 i think it was really it was well
22:51 thought through but um were there
22:54 any other things uh from your experience
22:58 uh as a project manager that helped you
23:00 like when you were transitioning from i
23:02 think you mentioned also the main
23:03 experience right
23:05 and that's true but yeah but i changed
23:08 the mind so so
23:09 uh often i would not go
23:12 for myself because i'm not that
23:15 representative here
23:16 uh but definitely i summarize some
23:20 background that you can transfer from
23:23 project manager to data science
23:25 um it's not that obvious uh and i really
23:28 like
23:28 to to put some time on this question
23:31 basically
23:32 some people think that it's quite
23:33 obvious to transfer from data
23:36 engineering or
23:37 from data analytics to data science okay
23:40 because you can code you can
23:41 analyze data process data and you
23:45 already know some query language query
23:47 languages and so on
23:49 but people i think underestimate what
23:51 benefits um
23:53 you can bring to data science coming
23:55 from project management
23:57 and this benefits and then soft skills
23:59 definitely
24:00 uh what i want to mention it uh
24:04 you are experienced in planning
24:07 projects and any data science project is
24:10 first of all project
24:11 and you have to plan it in advance
24:14 and you already know how to do this
24:16 right you have to
24:18 focus on big pictures so not restrict
24:21 yourself to some details but you have to
24:24 plan your road map uh set some
24:26 milestones and so on so on so it's
24:28 typically
24:29 a normal project that you have to set up
24:33 and you have to decompose it
24:36 you have to schedule it you have to plan
24:39 it and
24:40 this you already know how to do is quite
24:42 important and usually it has been done
24:44 by
24:45 some lead or manager or so on and in
24:47 data science
24:48 being data science manager it's the best
24:51 thing that you can do
24:52 because you you know both things from
24:55 two
24:55 uh so both things from from
24:58 perspective uh from your perspective and
25:01 you also can define success measures
25:04 it's quite important and really
25:05 difficult
25:06 um because um people tend to define it
25:10 from their point of view
25:12 and if you're really into business if
25:13 you really stay
25:15 close to the business decisions you can
25:17 identify your success in terms of
25:19 business
25:20 revenue margin or what you can imagine
25:23 and this what boards and managers really
25:26 like
25:27 when you work as data scientists you can
25:28 speak with them on the same language and
25:31 they can understand you
25:32 you are transparent and it's super
25:35 important i would what i do from my
25:37 practice
25:38 um what what else uh
25:41 speaks the same language and that's what
25:43 i mentioned
25:45 and i think that uh
25:48 it has been already covered uh in your
25:51 uh in in one of your in one of data
25:54 and data talks broadcast by vien
25:57 vashishta
25:58 he spoke a lot about the importance of
26:00 business language
26:01 and it was quite nice talk i remember
26:05 yeah but what i also find useful
26:10 uh getting borrow from project
26:12 management experience
26:13 is be business oriented uh
26:17 so when you make some analysis uh data
26:20 analysis you extract
26:21 and derive some some sense some
26:23 knowledge you probably find some
26:25 outliers and you plot some distributions
26:27 okay it's nice but what does it mean not
26:31 for you as a
26:32 data scientist or statistician what does
26:35 it mean for business
26:36 where do you lose money where do you
26:38 earn it why you lose some customer why
26:40 charm rates so high and when
26:42 and it's it's really important to put it
26:45 in the business language
26:47 and to understand the reason uh what
26:50 your distribution shows you
26:51 in terms of business terms and
26:55 also understanding the business really
26:57 help you in problem definition
26:59 so you can frame your problem before
27:02 solving it
27:02 uh really clear for everyone
27:06 and it's also entangled with the
27:09 business understanding i think that
27:11 elena some will
27:12 mention it in her talk how your machine
27:14 learning project will fail so she spoke
27:17 a lot about problem definition and how
27:19 it is
27:20 might how it is important and for this
27:23 you definitely should understand how
27:24 business work
27:26 uh then uh you as a project manager uh
27:30 already had experience to communicate
27:32 with stakeholders and
27:34 to be clear to deliver the right
27:37 information
27:37 in the right time in right order this
27:40 everything that important
27:41 also in data science because you build
27:44 model not for building it
27:45 but to deliver value to the business and
27:48 to communicate it right
27:50 and the last thing probably what not
27:53 least
27:54 what i also put in my list um is be
27:56 proactive
27:58 it's really when you project manager uh
27:59 you have to be proactive you have to
28:02 initiate many processes you have to
28:06 organize people organize things and plan
28:09 and so on and so on and this
28:11 productivity is
28:12 super nice also in data science because
28:16 it's somehow from my point of view fills
28:19 a gap between technical implementation
28:21 engineering and
28:23 concepts mathematical concepts to the
28:25 business
28:26 and this really uh where i feel that
28:31 people could improve themselves to get
28:34 on business level
28:35 um and this productivity and curiosity
28:39 about business purposes
28:41 about business kpis will definitely help
28:44 uh to bring your model on next level and
28:47 estimate it in business
28:48 uh kpis and yeah so
28:51 this is what project management uh my
28:54 project management experience
28:55 uh bring me to the data science
28:59 yeah yeah and yeah thanks for mentioning
29:02 some of the
29:03 presentations we had on data talks club
29:05 and for those who are listening
29:07 or watching they are on our youtube
29:09 channel right now i might be busy to to
29:12 to put the links there but uh you can
29:15 just go to our channel after this talk
29:17 and
29:17 uh you will find so one was uh a talk by
29:20 vin
29:21 vashishta about monetizing machine
29:23 learning and
29:24 the other one from yelena somewhere love
29:28 about how your machine learning project
29:31 will fail so these two
29:32 and i think the elena stock is one of
29:34 our top most watched
29:36 talks so yeah check it out and i wanted
29:39 to ask
29:40 you also so you mentioned that um
29:43 one of the things that helped you most
29:45 were like this
29:48 planning skill so you were able to plan
29:50 a project because the data science
29:51 project is a project and
29:53 because you have you had experience
29:55 planning projects you can
29:57 take this experience and apply it to
29:58 data science projects
30:00 and then then see in this big picture
30:03 and i'm wondering for those who do not
30:06 have this um this background in project
30:09 management
30:10 maybe there is a simple course or a book
30:13 that they can take to to get this skill
30:17 this planning skill maybe you have some
30:18 recommendation for that
30:20 definitely and it's uh it's a
30:25 fortune that it's already developed i
30:28 would recommend to use
30:29 uh the standard of the industry in data
30:32 mining crisp dam
30:34 framework it's really convenient for
30:37 data science projects
30:38 and i think this is so far the standard
30:42 and i also use it it's
30:45 nice structured and you can
30:48 structure your project uh based on the
30:51 stage
30:52 and of the crisp dam framework um
30:56 it's it's really well designed and yeah
30:59 so i think it's one way to go
31:02 and it regardless either you come from
31:04 project management or from
31:06 from whatever it's nice to use in data
31:09 science
31:10 yeah yeah this is even though it's a bit
31:13 old uh
31:14 methodology i don't know it's 20 years
31:16 old i think it's
31:17 surprisingly it's surprising that it
31:20 still applies to projects
31:21 these days um
31:25 so like would you say that planning
31:28 skill was the most
31:29 useful one to have or i think that um
31:34 the most useful skill uh to have for
31:38 in in my situation at least is being
31:40 business oriented
31:42 because your business your stakeholders
31:44 expect from you to deliver value
31:47 and of course you have to plan uh it's
31:49 like
31:50 without any doubts but if you being
31:53 transparent
31:54 if you speak the same language if you
31:56 orient to business kpis
31:58 this what uh brings you the most success
32:01 uh
32:01 to really deliver value and
32:05 not statistical inferences from from the
32:07 data but
32:08 transfer them to the business terms i
32:10 think
32:11 this would be the most important thing
32:13 to for data scientists it
32:15 helps
32:19 we have a question from zandala
32:22 so do you think an experienced
32:26 project manager would be uh would
32:28 already be a good fit for
32:30 a junior data analytic analysts role or
32:33 they still would need to learn some
32:35 things to pick up some extra skills
32:38 to be able to work as a data analyst
32:42 that's um yeah i think i mentioned it
32:44 but
32:45 um yeah i will elaborate more on my
32:47 response
32:48 uh basically the being
32:52 become a data analyst after project
32:54 management
32:55 manager career is it's exactly the way
32:57 to go because
32:59 you see a lot of data you have to
33:01 analyze it and you have to derive some
33:03 knowledge out of this and what i would
33:05 recommend
33:06 you uh to start with if you're already
33:09 working as a product manager
33:11 and you are eager to tend your career
33:14 towards
33:15 data science uh just start to analyze
33:17 data what you already have
33:19 because you have your data you have your
33:21 project and
33:22 i i'm sure that you definitely know how
33:24 you can improve
33:25 your decision based on your data so you
33:28 can start straight away
33:29 and it will be amazing because you will
33:32 be motivated in doing this
33:33 uh like going after your full day of
33:36 work uh
33:37 to to your home and pick some knowledge
33:40 from some
33:41 courses it's probably not that motivated
33:43 because you're already tired and you
33:45 want to
33:46 relax and so on it's overwhelming i
33:47 would say but if you really try to apply
33:50 your knowledge and your skills
33:52 in data analysis on your work uh it's
33:55 just
33:55 a way to go because in in it's also
33:58 beneficial for your
34:00 project management uh task because you
34:02 will
34:04 decide better you will make better
34:06 decision based on the data
34:08 and based on the knowledge that you
34:10 derived so
34:11 try to apply your knowledge already
34:12 being a product manager
34:14 and try to get into data analysis as
34:16 soon as possible
34:18 well i assume the usual technology stack
34:20 the tools that data analysts use
34:22 uh is quite different from what a
34:25 project manager would use so i imagine
34:27 uh like for project manager uh
34:31 the two that to go analysis to would be
34:33 excel microsoft excel or something
34:35 similar like spreadsheet
34:37 software so how would you go
34:40 from this working with excel
34:43 spreadsheets to
34:45 sql or even python and pandas
34:48 yeah yeah probably i would recommend to
34:50 start with a framework that already
34:53 developed for data analysis and
34:55 it's actually drag and drop tools for
34:57 example
34:58 tableau for example tree factor for data
35:01 cleaning
35:02 and data analysis and it's uh you don't
35:04 need to
35:06 learn any coding uh language
35:09 to start with this tool but you already
35:11 can analyze it
35:12 you already can understand some
35:14 statistics some summary statistics from
35:16 this
35:17 um tool just um put your data there and
35:21 try to
35:22 to play around with this to plot some
35:24 distributions and to analyze it
35:26 so you don't need actually code
35:29 at the very very beginning as as a next
35:32 step
35:32 i would definitely recommend to get some
35:34 courses on python
35:36 probably just a simple one from udacity
35:38 or some
35:39 somewhere and just to get some basic uh
35:43 knowledge about packages that you can
35:46 analyze data
35:47 and visualize it it's not that difficult
35:50 at all
35:51 because python has really low threshold
35:53 to get in
35:54 and it's easy to learn that's why it's
35:56 so common uh
35:57 in in community because uh it's it's
36:00 it's really not that hard and i
36:02 definitely recommend you as a next step
36:04 uh try to pick some um python knowledge
36:08 and already apply some portly proof
36:12 charts or something like this and panda
36:14 sits
36:16 so what would be the best way to start
36:18 actually with coding
36:19 now one thing of course i i think you
36:22 mentioned just
36:23 take some course online course i don't
36:25 know
36:26 [Music]
36:27 maybe it doesn't really matter which one
36:28 just take one course and try to go
36:30 through this
36:31 uh or maybe you have some
36:32 recommendations but uh
36:34 so what i want to ask is okay somebody
36:37 did this course
36:39 so what's next like how do can they
36:42 apply this to actually solving the
36:44 problem
36:45 [Music]
36:46 um for me it was uh like i started to
36:50 analyze data with
36:51 uh through this python in university
36:55 and i had some class on this um but it
36:57 was mostly recommendation and buzzwords
36:59 like
37:00 a jupiter notebook and you figure out by
37:02 yourself what's going on so it's
37:04 it's not like somebody teach me also and
37:06 now what
37:08 my way to to how i would recommend
37:11 people to really understand where to go
37:13 in data analysis for example
37:15 join communities it's super important
37:17 that's what i learned and i regret that
37:19 i didn't do it early
37:22 data talks community open data science
37:24 community
37:25 and all this it's a lot and this is a
37:28 trend
37:29 like we have observed last week
37:32 community is really powerful
37:33 and don't be shy because in this
37:36 community
37:36 there are a lot of people on different
37:38 levels and you can ask
37:40 whatever you have in mind and people
37:42 quite open
37:43 and we need to help start to
37:47 learn from the people and start to be
37:49 curious about things
37:50 um yeah so that's what i would recommend
37:53 and you will definitely
37:55 figure out uh how people analyze data
37:58 uh another advice that i just remember
38:01 that
38:02 start to open account on kaggle
38:06 so that's what also helped me a lot uh
38:09 and observe uh and study from from
38:12 others
38:12 because in kaggle you will find a lot of
38:14 open notebooks
38:16 and you can understand how people
38:19 uh basically analyze data and just start
38:22 to repeat it
38:23 so fake it until you make it right so
38:26 start to repeat the best techniques the
38:29 best practices what you observed
38:32 try to pick of course the advanced
38:35 i mean people who really achieved a lot
38:40 of uncargo because
38:41 they probably will code some
38:43 professional
38:45 functions and so on and yeah just
38:48 try to observe what other people do
38:51 if you start to learn it's important
38:54 so you you don't need to compete on
38:57 kaggle to actually
38:58 learn from this right you can just go to
39:00 take a look at these notebooks kernels
39:02 and try to reproduce what
39:04 others are doing there and that's
39:06 already
39:07 a very good start right yeah from from
39:10 the very beginning probably
39:12 you cannot compete if you don't want but
39:16 i did and it was quite fun because
39:19 it was a group as i mentioned in open
39:21 data science communities course
39:23 they actually one or two
39:27 homeworks was to to compete on this
39:29 cargo competition
39:30 it was fun because it was a group of
39:32 people who tried to solve the same
39:34 problem
39:35 and there in the very end we share our
39:38 notebooks
39:38 and we learn from each other and you uh
39:41 resolve this problem and your peer
39:43 resolves this problem
39:44 and you probably might find his solution
39:47 uh
39:47 interesting or i don't know to learn
39:50 from from from others and somebody learn
39:52 from your dis
39:53 from your solution i think it's it's
39:55 nice and it's fun i think it's it's
39:57 really important to stay motivated
39:59 during the learning process
40:01 and uh yeah but when you uh to kaggle is
40:05 fun and you
40:05 of course can pick you can acquire a lot
40:09 of useful skills there
40:10 you can also do this by courses and then
40:12 you can do
40:13 a couple of courses about python a
40:16 couple of courses about analytics
40:18 but at work and if you work as a data
40:20 scientist
40:21 you it's not enough right so you also
40:24 need to
40:25 to have some other skills like for
40:26 example once you train the model
40:29 you need to be able to perhaps put it in
40:31 a flask or docker or
40:34 package it in docker and deploy
40:35 somewhere um
40:38 and this is i imagine for people who
40:41 did not code as project managers and who
40:45 were doing things with excel this is a
40:48 pretty
40:49 big leap to go from that state to you
40:52 know
40:53 talking about docker and kubernetes and
40:56 all these things
40:57 so um yeah so after doing kaggle so
41:00 let's say
41:02 yeah what would be the next step to
41:04 actually to pick up these skills as well
41:07 yeah super nice question because it also
41:09 was a question to me
41:11 so how to to jump from from this
41:13 analytical skills to machine learning
41:15 and
41:16 then machine learning production yeah so
41:18 it's different story uh
41:20 and what i how i uh
41:24 overcome this uh i get i get to work
41:28 and basically i learned it on work at
41:30 work because
41:31 uh this where you see this enterprise
41:33 environment
41:34 where you see how people work and you
41:37 also collaborate
41:38 and collaborative development is quite
41:41 uh different from what you
41:43 write in notebook right so you have to
41:45 understand how git work you have to use
41:47 it you have to
41:48 merge and some branches and so on so
41:52 it's
41:52 it's different pro process and you also
41:56 should understand how to deploy your
41:57 code and test
41:59 and what tests exist and so so all these
42:02 practices
42:02 of development should be also picked up
42:06 and for this i would already recommend
42:08 some advanced
42:10 books for example clean code it's
42:13 really nice and important to read if you
42:16 want to
42:17 improve your coding skills and
42:20 this already advanced
42:23 skills i would say you can improve
42:26 and learn at work and
42:30 just to to observe how people do this
42:32 and
42:33 in the parallel you can also read books
42:35 uh about this
42:36 uh you're right uh it is quite a quite
42:40 big leap
42:41 um and yeah so basically what you're
42:45 saying is
42:45 it's enough uh to to get hired as a data
42:48 scientist
42:49 it's enough to uh know well um
42:53 the theory do a bit of kaggle know some
42:55 basic
42:56 basics of programming know how to
42:58 visualize data to do some
43:00 data analysis um all these things
43:03 so this is sufficient to uh to get hired
43:06 as a data scientist
43:08 but then on the job you learn all these
43:10 production skills
43:11 you learn about doctor you learn about
43:14 other things right two more things
43:18 what i planned for myself to
43:22 acquire job easily after graduating from
43:24 university basically i got into research
43:27 and i spent three years on specific
43:30 domain and it was super beneficial
43:32 because when you become professional in
43:34 some specific domain
43:36 you know things and you
43:39 can bring this knowledge uh to some
43:42 company
43:42 and what i learned and my thesis was
43:45 about fraud detection
43:46 i really studied this topic for three
43:48 years and i coded
43:50 a lot on this topic and i produced
43:53 um some projects on it different
43:56 uh different ones and it was super
43:59 beneficial for me
44:00 to get hired because my next work after
44:03 university after research
44:05 uh position i got hired as a
44:08 fraud detection a data scientist and
44:11 this theory
44:12 that i could bring to the company was
44:14 super beneficial so i would recommend if
44:16 you
44:16 really want to study at university get
44:19 involved in
44:20 some projects research project or get
44:23 position
44:23 in some laboratory because it's really
44:25 helps you to practice
44:27 uh first of all and the second try to be
44:30 t shape uh i think it's it's old concept
44:33 but it's still valid i would say so you
44:36 have to know or had
44:38 impression uh about anything like
44:42 math statistics engineering analytics
44:44 and so on so
44:46 but choose uh your strengths choose your
44:49 domain choose your topic where you can
44:51 say that
44:52 i i know things i know how to do this
44:55 and this will definitely help because um
44:58 yeah you can then
45:00 put your put put it in in your career
45:03 and use this benefit
45:04 that you learned yeah that's uh
45:08 that's indeed something that many people
45:10 overlook and for me personally it was
45:11 also the case like having this
45:13 experience in specific domain
45:15 uh for you how did you
45:18 did it happen then you that you choose
45:21 this
45:21 particular domain of fraud detection was
45:24 it
45:25 just by coincidence or you were actively
45:28 uh
45:28 looking to get involved into this field
45:31 yeah probably for me it was an accident
45:34 but i would recommend that
45:36 any topic or domains that you choose
45:38 should
45:39 should uh you should be patient about
45:42 this because
45:43 otherwise you lost motivation pretty
45:44 soon in my case it was that
45:46 um when i got a position in university
45:49 and i got
45:50 enrolled during the first semester in
45:53 university i was so
45:54 active and i wanted to study so one
45:56 professor
45:58 noticed me and invited to work to dodge
46:01 a telecom in his laboratory because he
46:04 saw that i could deliver and i could
46:07 help him
46:08 and to to to get some some result on his
46:11 research
46:12 and for me it was surprising because i i
46:14 didn't uh
46:15 search for for any work um at those time
46:19 so for me it was pure coincidence and i
46:22 i just
46:22 asked for that okay of course let's go
46:24 because i really i really want to
46:26 to get this practical knowledge and if
46:29 you can
46:29 also provide me some feedback on my work
46:32 it was it would be so so cool
46:33 collaboration
46:35 and that's how i get involved into the
46:37 research
46:38 i didn't honestly i didn't plan it but
46:41 now
46:42 i can say i can tell definitely that
46:44 it's worth to do this
46:45 if you can get involved into the
46:48 projects
46:50 yeah so what he did was you were active
46:52 during classes
46:54 and then uh people noticed you the
46:57 professor noticed you and uh
47:00 invited you to the lab and then after
47:03 graduating
47:05 uh you already had some experience the
47:07 main experience in front detection
47:08 and i guess uh the position you were
47:10 looking for was also in this area
47:12 in uh okay and uh
47:15 was it very helpful for you uh to have
47:18 this experience
47:19 already in this domain i guess your
47:21 conversation on interviews
47:23 this was purely about fraud detection
47:25 and what techniques i have been using so
47:27 far
47:28 so and uh what was helped a lot because
47:30 um that's
47:31 my thesis was on really advanced topic
47:34 so
47:34 in my thesis i modified node to vac a
47:38 technique
47:39 that has been developed in 2016 for
47:42 analyzing
47:43 networks and i apply this technique to
47:47 define or analyze money laundering
47:50 and fraud and anomalies in low networks
47:53 and basically i was working on the
47:56 identified fraud
47:57 in monitoring transactions and it's
47:59 super
48:00 hot and useful topic i would say
48:03 and then i i applied to the companies
48:07 that
48:07 also working with many laundry and with
48:10 uh
48:10 this fraud and so on so it was a match
48:13 right it was a very focused approach so
48:16 you had this domain expertise and then
48:18 you focused
48:19 specifically on companies that are doing
48:21 this uh sort of thing
48:23 okay and i guess it worked out right
48:25 yeah yeah
48:26 so uh out of i'm i don't know if you
48:29 remember the statistics uh
48:30 uh do you remember how many applications
48:32 did you send how many
48:34 interviews you bought oh it was a load
48:36 uh after university i sent
48:38 around 50 uh five zero applications
48:42 and i got actually three offers
48:46 and i choose from yeah it was uh
48:49 it is tough uh so when you try to get
48:51 the first
48:52 data science position and just remember
48:54 about it don't be
48:56 uh desperate or so on it it's hard
48:59 every time for everyone so don't be
49:02 disappointed
49:04 but it also means that there are 50
49:07 companies
49:08 i don't know what was your uh
49:10 [Music]
49:12 search area like was it just berlin or
49:16 germany or
49:17 europe but 50 is quite a few right
49:21 um yeah and you know i was quite
49:24 ambitious i also applied in
49:26 big four companies and um and google
49:29 because my my
49:30 this is based on the uh techniques that
49:32 they extensively use uh like no
49:34 tobacco's time it was
49:35 super super uh there and i applied in
49:38 surya
49:39 but it's like uh yeah so it was
49:43 nice to do i would say of course i
49:45 didn't hope for anything but
49:47 yeah and big four is like this uh big uh
49:51 consultancy companies like exactly we
49:52 see deloitte uh
49:55 yeah okay um
49:59 so we have a question uh
50:02 it's did you feel any discrimination as
50:06 a woman
50:07 when interviewing or
50:11 i would say no
50:15 not at all so
50:18 i think that uh every time when i got
50:20 interviewed i think that
50:22 people asked me professional questions
50:25 on my topic and i would say that i
50:29 don't feel any discrimination uh at my
50:32 processes at least
50:34 was it mostly in germany or you also
50:37 you said applied to to zurich yeah yeah
50:40 i i didn't get in into uh interview
50:44 process
50:44 uh and sorry but yes uh any um
50:47 interview processes that i got so far i
50:49 got in germany
50:50 um yeah it was quite professional
50:53 and i say that it's decent processes
50:58 and do you think you saw any uh
51:02 difference between the applications
51:06 that you covered in cognition courses in
51:09 classes
51:10 and applications real applications in
51:12 the industry
51:13 uh that's a question from kamala yeah
51:16 it's it's totally corresponds
51:18 uh but uh what i want to to to
51:22 emphasize here i already applied
51:26 these techniques to practice during my
51:28 research and this was
51:29 extremely beneficial because when you
51:31 just learn these techniques
51:33 and machine learning approaches and you
51:36 don't apply it
51:38 okay you don't really understand how it
51:40 works on the hood
51:41 but if you apply it immediately you'll
51:43 understand it you remember it and you
51:45 can repeat it
51:46 and so then when i um
51:51 go to work after university i already
51:54 knew more or less what i'm gonna do
51:56 because i already did it uh yes it's
51:58 definitely important
51:59 it's definitely useful and what i have
52:01 learned at the university is
52:03 applicable so the it was quite in uh
52:06 so there was not no big gap between uh
52:10 theory and practice sorry i was so no
52:13 um but this also depends on the courses
52:15 that you choose right so
52:16 i try to choose practical deep courses
52:20 which i know uh will be
52:23 definitely useful another tip uh
52:26 actually i remember that i want to
52:28 share with you if you will find
52:31 work search for work as a data scientist
52:34 or so
52:34 and you just at the very beginning of
52:36 your
52:38 chat of your career changing
52:41 uh open and analyze the job description
52:44 data science or job description
52:46 that that you can find in the internet
52:49 because in this way
52:50 you will at least get familiar with
52:52 techniques with
52:53 what um your employer expects from you
52:57 and this is super important to know in
52:58 advance what to learn because you can
53:01 learn something
53:02 for example matlab it's it's it's useful
53:05 you can do
53:06 a lot of stuff with matlab but not many
53:09 employers i would say require it and to
53:12 be prepared from the very beginning
53:14 to not learn uh stuff that you don't
53:16 need are not applicable in the end
53:18 so try to research on on the job market
53:22 uh and from the very beginning to
53:23 understand why you do this and
53:25 what you actually have to do
53:29 yeah that's so that's a great tip um
53:31 yeah i don't know if
53:33 we have enough time for this question
53:34 but i really wanted to ask you
53:36 about uh let's say somebody wants to go
53:40 into data science now but they don't
53:43 uh they don't have enough time or maybe
53:48 they don't have enough freedom to let's
53:49 take quit their job and do
53:51 a masters and spend two three years
53:53 doing that um
53:56 do you uh have any recommendations for
53:59 them how should they
54:01 structure their learning plan uh to be
54:04 able to
54:05 still make the transition while while
54:08 working yes i think i can
54:11 i can give some some tips or some
54:14 recommendations
54:15 first of all start to be interested in
54:17 data analysis and start to
54:19 apply this on your work already this
54:22 would be like a first step of uh
54:25 getting involved in some data analysis
54:28 then when you
54:29 feel that you can do something and you
54:31 can derive some knowledge and you
54:33 can use it for for your decision making
54:35 process
54:36 um if you don't have a time or
54:39 opportunity to get to university what i
54:42 would recommend probably to
54:43 get involved in some structured courses
54:46 on data on data science for example
54:49 uh this i i didn't do it by myself but i
54:52 know some people who did it
54:53 uh nana degree from udacity i think or
54:56 udemy i don't remember but there is
54:59 udacity so this 90 degrees at last six
55:01 months
55:02 um one friend of mine she did it and she
55:08 she got some good impression from this
55:10 courses and she learned a lot
55:13 they they provide some solid uh
55:16 program and the main thing that they
55:19 structure it
55:20 so you will not you will not lost uh
55:23 during the learning process and six
55:25 months i would say it's not enough
55:27 to to really uh to really
55:30 be a good data scientist or so but at
55:33 least
55:34 you can you can follow this path
55:38 and then when you graduate from this you
55:41 can
55:42 get involved in the open data science
55:44 courses
55:45 sml course that we mentioned before it
55:48 would be
55:48 next step and what i mentioned before
55:51 you have to
55:54 increase the level of complexity uh
55:56 steadily
55:57 so don't try and try to jump in the most
56:00 deep topic
56:01 and because it is it will not gonna help
56:04 you
56:05 but try to go with small steps and
56:09 to really get focused uh that's
56:12 probably how you can approach this path
56:14 without university degree
56:19 do you uh remember which courses your
56:21 friend
56:22 took and i don't know if the your friend
56:24 was
56:25 a project manager manager or what kind
56:28 of she's from
56:29 economics and yeah so um
56:32 she she's quite well in statistics i
56:34 think it's it
56:35 exactly attract data science uh track on
56:39 another degree i think it's like
56:42 because i imagine that uh i
56:45 to be honest i don't know much about
56:47 economics uh what they
56:49 what kind of tools they use at work or
56:52 what what they learn
56:54 but they imagine they already know how
56:55 to they know mass and perhaps they
56:58 already know
56:59 some data analysis analytics uh uh
57:02 at least basics like maybe excel or
57:04 something
57:06 yes yes of course just familiar with
57:08 statistics with math
57:09 and yeah so it depends on your
57:11 background of course if you
57:13 if you're not familiar with mars you
57:16 have to figure out how to study it
57:17 because it's a basis
57:20 so you um like if you don't know math
57:23 you'll need to find a way to to pick it
57:25 uh do do you maybe
57:28 have any recommendation which areas
57:30 because math when we say math it's a lot
57:32 of things right you can study math for
57:34 100 years and will not
57:37 any areas in mathematics that you think
57:39 are particularly useful
57:42 probability theory for sure uh
57:45 statistics
57:46 if if i can put it like it's not
57:49 it's probably separate but
57:53 for me it was also graph series super
57:56 important
57:57 uh what else differential equations
57:59 that's what i studied but
58:01 if you are not familiar with mars to
58:03 study it by yourself from scratch
58:06 i find it super challenging and in this
58:09 way
58:09 um i would probably go for practical
58:13 use cases and start to understand it
58:16 from practice
58:17 because it's it's better if you do it by
58:19 yourself you understand
58:21 uh why what result what's the input and
58:24 so on so at least this kind of
58:26 understanding this kind of
58:28 um way of thinking that's what you can
58:31 develop
58:32 but start with theoretical fundamentals
58:36 of
58:36 mars and then figure out by yourself how
58:38 to apply it to the problem
58:40 oh it's it could be extremely uh
58:43 difficult yes
58:44 i think you mentioned that a couple of
58:46 times already built on your strengths
58:48 and if your strength is uh in project
58:51 management it's
58:52 uh planning the main expertise to use
58:55 that right and try to
58:57 uh focus on problems first and then
59:01 eventually you will uh
59:04 [Music]
59:06 well what for me works is uh practice
59:09 like getting to code uh as fast as
59:11 possible and then trying to code but i'm
59:13 also an engineer and perhaps this is not
59:16 the best
59:17 suggestion for project management for
59:19 project managers right
59:20 but like using these skills that they
59:22 have already
59:24 uh do you do you know how they can do
59:26 this like let's say
59:28 a project manager doesn't know
59:30 mathematics they don't know how to code
59:32 but they have a lot of domain expertise
59:35 so i think
59:36 you mentioned uh like learning at uh at
59:39 work
59:40 right so exactly then then is exactly
59:42 practical
59:43 case so you you if you uh domain
59:46 expert and you know for example
59:48 marketing you know that user
59:50 segmentation is a hot topic and you
59:52 struggle to find the optimal
59:54 segmentation to run your marketing
59:55 campaign
59:56 efficiently and to attract uh users that
59:59 you really
1:00:00 want and so on you know the problem and
1:00:02 you know what you want to achieve you
1:00:04 know you keep your eyes at least
1:00:05 and you already can google a bit how
1:00:08 people
1:00:09 usually solve this problem what's the
1:00:10 best practices and so on
1:00:12 and just try to go from the problem
1:00:15 um because it's your strengths try to
1:00:18 try to use it so
1:00:19 in this way i would recommend to go from
1:00:21 from the use case that you have at work
1:00:24 and yeah so also what you did is you
1:00:28 really uh thought uh carefully about
1:00:31 your
1:00:32 at least that was my impression like
1:00:34 about how you structure your learning
1:00:36 and perhaps this is what you can also do
1:00:38 as a project manager
1:00:40 to really think about like all these
1:00:42 bits and pieces and i know find the
1:00:46 i was taking a course about project
1:00:48 management recently and i
1:00:49 learned about this critical path
1:00:51 expression like the concept of critical
1:00:53 power so perhaps it's also
1:00:55 important to find this critical path in
1:00:57 your learning and uh
1:00:58 you know focus on that right yeah yeah
1:01:01 uh yeah i have to mention that i spent
1:01:03 nine years on on studying in my life
1:01:06 and i think the most important takeaways
1:01:08 that i took is
1:01:10 learn how to study so basically you will
1:01:13 be studying all your life
1:01:14 and just get used to this and if you
1:01:17 will not find efficient way to structure
1:01:19 information you will
1:01:20 be lost so it's important do you have
1:01:24 any other tips like tip sticks to
1:01:27 yeah i think i put something in my list
1:01:31 uh personal tips and tricks how to get
1:01:34 into data science faster and shorter
1:01:36 probably you will be interested in it
1:01:38 [Music]
1:01:40 that's i mentioned some of them but i
1:01:43 just want to summarize
1:01:45 basically get involved into the projects
1:01:48 voluntary projects study project open
1:01:51 source project doesn't matter
1:01:52 that was that's what i did i uh actually
1:01:55 was so active that i was involved in the
1:01:57 um i volunteered to to get involved in
1:02:00 some
1:02:00 research uh local research and did some
1:02:03 analysis for for two years in a row
1:02:06 uh and it's officially published in the
1:02:08 internet and many people
1:02:10 have been interested in it and it it
1:02:12 helped me
1:02:13 to to progress and i also got a lot of
1:02:16 feedback from from people around
1:02:18 who i wasn't interested in this and
1:02:21 it's really helpful to to improve
1:02:24 um then another tip
1:02:30 so get involved in the machine learning
1:02:33 class
1:02:33 course from open data science it's
1:02:35 helpful
1:02:36 um yeah so this this
1:02:40 this is important narrow down your scope
1:02:43 uh don't try to be generalist
1:02:46 like data scientists and everything so
1:02:49 try to find your
1:02:51 strengths uh try to narrow your domain
1:02:54 and be uh be active there
1:02:58 because otherwise you will be lost as i
1:03:00 mentioned
1:03:01 yes and um
1:03:05 uh when you look uh when you're
1:03:08 searching for the first job
1:03:10 it's also interesting and would be
1:03:11 important to
1:03:13 look at the annual service
1:03:16 i mean service from orale from
1:03:20 jetbrains and other services that
1:03:23 actually
1:03:23 explore data science
1:03:27 field and ask data scientists uh which
1:03:31 tools they use
1:03:32 which problems they resolved and so on
1:03:33 so on that's
1:03:35 you can find this um service in internet
1:03:39 and i actually also did some service on
1:03:41 this and analyzed and
1:03:42 posted uh also an internet because it's
1:03:45 my time when i started to work as a data
1:03:47 scientist i was so interested
1:03:49 what tools should i learn what
1:03:53 positions should i go and so on and to
1:03:56 get some feelings about this i joined
1:04:00 some project and i
1:04:01 get some research and analysis on this
1:04:03 topic so
1:04:04 yeah and communities join communities
1:04:06 it's important
1:04:08 yes data talks club is a good
1:04:12 you will not forget it yeah yeah like
1:04:14 speaking of this uh
1:04:17 surveys i think uh also a good one is
1:04:20 from stackoverflow even though it's not
1:04:22 data science specific but i think they
1:04:24 do a great job and the the
1:04:26 stick overflow is a very large community
1:04:29 so the
1:04:30 [Music]
1:04:31 the response rate and the amount of
1:04:33 information that people share there is
1:04:35 amazing
1:04:36 so you set one from o'reilly another one
1:04:39 jetbrains yeah also yeah i wasn't aware
1:04:42 of this so this jetbrains one
1:04:44 yeah i found them last year and it's
1:04:47 comprehensive and it's also not in data
1:04:49 science field but it's
1:04:51 a development field i would say but it's
1:04:55 a lot yes so if you can give me some
