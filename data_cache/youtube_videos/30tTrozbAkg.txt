1:01 to make do without it okay so now I'm
1:07 opening the questions we prepared for
1:09 you and if you're ready we can
1:15 start let's
1:17 start this week we'll talk about AI for
1:20 Ecology biodiversity and conservation
1:23 and we have a special guest today Tanya
1:25 Tanya is a computational ecologist with
1:27 research at the unique intersection of
1:29 computer science B life biology and
1:32 social sciences and social sciences and
1:35 this is what we will be talking today so
1:37 welcome to our
1:41 interview thank you thank you for having
1:44 me yeah and as usual the questions for
1:47 today's interview are prepared by
1:48 Johanna Bay thanks Johanna for your help
1:51 and let's start so before we go into our
1:54 main topic of AI for Ecology
1:56 biodiversity and conservation let's
1:59 start with your background can you tell
2:00 us about your career Journey so
2:03 far yes so currently I am professor of
2:06 computer science and engineering
2:07 electrical Computer Engineering and
2:10 evolution ecology and organismal biology
2:12 at the Ohio State University in the
2:15 state of Ohio in United States uh I'm
2:18 also director of the translational data
2:21 analytics Institute there that's the
2:23 largest interdisciplinary Research
2:24 Institute at OSU and OSU is a very large
2:28 University uh and that is a community
2:32 research Community within the university
2:34 that unites anybody who in some way
2:38 generates uses analyzes represent is
2:40 Curious by enabled by U adjacent to data
2:44 in their research scholarship and
2:45 Creative Expressions and that these days
2:48 that's pretty much everybody so we have
2:51 people from Arts and Humanities to
2:52 statistics and computer science my own
2:55 research and my own focus is on AI for
2:59 Ecology environment
3:00 BYOD diversity and
3:02 conservation and um that journey in
3:06 research started with my PhD at the
3:09 University of Illinois at Orban champ
3:11 pain which I got in
3:14 2002 a while ago uh and after a
3:20 postdoc uh postdoctoral um training at
3:24 the University of New Mexico in
3:26 computational uh philogyny that's
3:29 evolutionary bi ology and then in
3:31 computation College in Princeton I
3:34 started as a faculty at the University
3:36 ofo Chicago in 2005 and came to the Ohio
3:40 State University in 2020 right before
3:44 the pandemic January 2020 was great
3:47 timing so I've been here ever since um
3:51 and in and along the way uh in my
3:55 journey I did my PhD in very theoretical
3:58 computer science so that had nothing to
4:01 do with ecology but uh I um did have
4:07 jobs in a Colley departments and worked
4:09 with a colist and married to one so I've
4:12 walked away from many conversations with
4:14 a colist that there better ways there
4:17 got to be better ways of answering
4:19 questions that they were asking um other
4:22 than what was typical at the time is
4:24 creating systems of partial differential
4:26 equations describing um different
4:28 aspects of the system with having more
4:30 parameters than uh than like birds or or
4:35 animals um that we wanted in the
4:38 population that we wanted to
4:39 characterize and so I also studied uh
4:43 it's called computational ecology or
4:46 biology where you model population of
4:48 fish or like there's also these models
4:52 like Predator prey right yeah a lot of a
4:56 ton of differential equations and like
4:58 actually when I was studying like I was
5:01 studying computer science and I was
5:02 thinking like why do I need all
5:05 that yeah so I was thinking the same
5:07 thing especially when when uh working on
5:11 data sets I I remember one was uh
5:15 working for the Army Corps of Engineers
5:18 because the thing is in the US the
5:21 AR the army bases are often the last big
5:27 habitats untouched actually habitats
5:30 of uh many rare and endangered species
5:34 and so they're required by law to do
5:38 impact assessment on their activities on
5:40 these endangered species this is The
5:42 Endangered Species Act that just
5:43 celebrated its 50th anniversary in the
5:45 United States in
5:47 December so if they want to do a an
5:51 exercise a military exercise or put a
5:53 road through the military base they need
5:56 to figure out what's the impact going to
5:58 be on the endangered species and so I
6:00 spent a lot of time modeling the impact
6:03 of like 30 Birds population with like
6:07 100 parameter systems and I was like no
6:09 this has got to be a better way so after
6:11 my PhD I did start developing the whole
6:15 area what it would be look what it would
6:18 look like what are the algorithmic
6:20 approaches that are not necessarily the
6:22 dynamic
6:23 systems and uh in the process realized
6:27 that we
6:28 need methods like machine learning
6:30 computer vision methods for even basic
6:33 analysis of data because images are by
6:37 far the largest and most abundant source
6:40 of information about data um about
6:43 anything in the world including
6:45 including wildlife and so that's where
6:49 in
6:50 2011 uh we got the
6:52 first almost by accident the first
6:55 program for identifying individual
6:57 zebras from photographs um with just two
7:02 clicks and that
7:04 was um part of my collaboration with
7:09 behavioral e colist so I started out uh
7:12 with a colle working with a colist who
7:14 study behavior of animals particularly
7:16 social
7:17 behavior um and more specifically zebras
7:21 which is why zebrra in my background
7:23 here uh so Dan Rubenstein a professor at
7:27 Princeton University in the US in New
7:29 Jersey
7:30 uh the
7:33 premier researcher who studies equids so
7:37 zebra's horses
7:39 dys and they were studying social
7:41 behavior and I was like wait how do you
7:43 know who is whose zebra
7:46 friend like well we have a field
7:49 assistant who goes out in the field you
7:51 know looks on a closed loop in this
7:54 Nature Preserve in Kenya every time she
7:56 sees zebras um she stops she takes GPS
7:59 tries to make very very very careful
8:01 pictures uh take of every zebra that she
8:04 sees with making sure they're facing
8:06 right with like the the uh whole side
8:11 visible and she keeps the best picture
8:13 and then she brings them to the back to
8:15 the lab and then starts clicking on the
8:17 outline of the zebra and I was watching
8:20 her do that and I'm like I'm in an
8:23 impatient engineer right so two minutes
8:26 into it I'm like how long is it going to
8:27 take they're like wait
8:29 five minutes later I'm like this is
8:31 taking forever how long is it going to
8:32 take like
8:34 wait 20 minutes later after clicking on
8:37 the outline because what happened is
8:39 that they would click very very very
8:40 carefully on the outline and there was a
8:42 program that would fit a 3D model and
8:44 then match pixel for Pixel uh of the the
8:47 the lines of the zebras which is also
8:49 very inaccurate I'm like oh my God this
8:51 is insane this is taking
8:55 forever and they're like oh if you're so
8:58 impatient you know do you think you can
9:00 do better I like you want a bet it
9:02 should take two
9:03 clicks so after that of course I go to
9:07 my then PhD student M ciran and I just
9:11 bet my reputation that we can identify
9:13 individual zebras from photographs in
9:15 two
9:17 clicks but I also have an idea how to do
9:19 it so we did and it was okay um and then
9:25 um but it got a lot of publicity because
9:28 you know walking bar codes kind of
9:31 analogy even though it's not accurate
9:33 but that's you know really identifying
9:35 individual zebras to photographs great
9:38 so a proper computer vision researcher
9:41 Chuck Stewart at TR po Technic Institute
9:43 heard about it and was uh and approached
9:46 me at a conference saying great you can
9:50 identify individual zebras from
9:52 photographs uh but we can do better I'm
9:54 like fantastic let's do it and so we did
9:57 and that's when in 2013 we publish this
10:00 um paper which on properly identifying
10:04 individual animals from photographs
10:05 anything strip uh spotted wrinkled
10:08 notched so that's expanded the number of
10:10 species proper computer vision approach
10:13 um in some obscure we published it in
10:16 some obscure computer Vision conference
10:17 and then two months later we had we were
10:20 we thought we were done but then because
10:22 we published right this is how research
10:24 works but two months later we had
10:25 requests from about 70
10:28 70 uh researchers all over the pl all
10:31 over the world asking can you do my
10:33 species can you do my species everything
10:34 from like tiny Hawaiian Smiles beautiful
10:37 ones look them up to whale sharks and uh
10:42 uh Tigers everything I'm like oh my God
10:45 this is actually useful for
10:47 conservation so we started a nonprofit
10:50 wild me that creates AI solutions for
10:52 conservation and his home of the
10:55 platform wild book which um is using
10:58 this individual ID to really organize
11:02 observations about animals and then
11:06 uh to continue research in this recently
11:10 found by the US National Science
11:12 Foundation we founded a whole new field
11:14 of science called image omic the omx of
11:18 images and we'll practice pronouncing
11:20 that
11:22 umix image omx the omx of images so it's
11:25 image omx right IM like
11:28 economics no like genomics like
11:31 proteomics metabolomics so protein right
11:35 so prote
11:37 omic um Jean omx there are so many more
11:41 omix than I could ever imagine yeah yes
11:46 so we'll talk a little bit about that
11:48 but uh and then Ai and biodiversity
11:50 chain Global Climate Center also
11:52 recently funded by the US National
11:54 Science Foundation and the Canada's uh
11:58 national science engineering research
12:00 council is a new center to understand
12:03 the impact of climate change on AI on
12:06 biodiversity using AI so with that this
12:08 is kind of most of the icons that in my
12:10 background and like very brief summary
12:13 of my
12:14 journey and Finny that you mentioned
12:16 that um like you said you are married to
12:19 if I understand correctly if I remember
12:20 correctly I'm married to was ecologist
12:24 ecologist yeah ecologist and then you
12:26 also observe how people do this in this
12:29 field and for you a computer scientist
12:31 that was like
12:34 seriously that takes so much time and
12:36 this is also my mother is also she's um
12:39 an
12:40 ecologist and like I
12:43 noticed I think it was 10 years ago when
12:45 I was helping here with some
12:47 calculations that the methods that are
12:50 used that are
12:52 super common place in uh like data
12:56 science in Industry are only getting
12:59 attention in ecology right and things
13:02 like I don't know time series analysis
13:04 like uh all this machine learning uh
13:07 classification
13:08 regression they're not really that
13:11 widespread and you could publish a paper
13:14 by just taking a data set with some
13:16 climate data and then off the shelf
13:19 model from Psychic learn fit in it and
13:21 then publishing the paper and to me it
13:23 was
13:25 like very interesting um observation
13:29 because like I had no idea that uh you
13:31 know I thought it's normal because like
13:33 I'm a data scientist I see this
13:35 happening every day at work right and I
13:38 guess this is this was also kind of your
13:40 experience right that you saw that
13:42 there's so much to be automated in this
13:45 area so it's more than automated um you
13:50 know biodiversity and conservation so I
13:54 would separate a little bit the climate
13:55 science environments and Science and
13:57 biodiversity and conservation
13:59 climate science I think gets a lot of
14:01 attention and reasonable amount of
14:03 resources recently so there are amazing
14:07 climate models and they're constantly
14:09 improving and there's an insane amount
14:10 of data that's there uh particularly
14:13 through remote sensing and so things
14:16 like agencies like um all the space
14:19 agencies that observe led by NASA the US
14:23 space agency and uh well National
14:27 atmospheric uh and space agency and then
14:32 um no not atmospheric I combine the two
14:36 agencies together apologies to NASA um
14:40 because uh the
14:43 the na
14:45 uh the Noah and NASA
14:48 sorry
14:50 um the two uh agencies that collect
14:54 remote sensing data in the US but then
14:56 also space agencies and equivalent
14:58 agencies throughout the world so there's
14:59 a lot of data about climate and climate
15:03 change and also
15:05 environmental um
15:07 data but for biodiversity and
15:10 conservation the data is very the data
15:13 situation is very very different in fact
15:15 we actually do not have good data in
15:20 this in this area you gave an example
15:23 like there was only 30 birds of a
15:25 certain species right and like how could
15:28 you this with standard for population
15:31 yeah um but the
15:34 biodiversity H that's related right
15:37 because I'm yes not really knowledgeable
15:39 in all this areas yeah yeah absolutely
15:42 so so you know not only populations are
15:45 not observed often enough so we have
15:48 this that the whole journey there
15:50 started with like you have we have 30
15:52 birds in a particular area that's the
15:55 population of these birds there are
15:57 other populations and so when they try
15:59 to model
16:01 these population Dynamics where you need
16:04 birth rate death rate dispersal rate you
16:06 know uh mating rates all all of these
16:09 kinds of
16:10 things uh successful
16:13 mating the the parameters that they
16:15 would take are okay so this is the
16:18 population uh in Florida but we have
16:21 this birth rate from uh similar species
16:25 in Texas great we'll use that we have a
16:29 death rate from this species but from 50
16:33 years ago you know so it's it's all over
16:36 the place and this is just the tip of
16:39 the iceberg we don't even have the basic
16:42 data we say that right now the recent
16:45 reports are saying that million species
16:47 are threatened with Extinction and by
16:49 the way million to put this in context
16:53 there is total estimated only about 10
16:57 million species of plants fungi and
17:02 animals out there that includes old bugs
17:05 all the Beetles insects everything
17:09 that's a shockingly low number right so
17:11 only 10 million species people think
17:14 they're billions MH that's what I
17:17 thought too well I billions yeah I
17:21 thought no only 10 million which means
17:24 that million million like 10% is uh
17:29 threatened with Extinction
17:31 yeah so that's that's the shocking
17:34 number right and so but the thing is
17:38 these are estimates we've done now
17:40 people have done now four different ways
17:42 of estimating the number of species and
17:44 they still come to the same number
17:46 roughly um and the one million of
17:49 threatened with Extinction is probably
17:50 an underestimate there's probably even
17:52 more but we really don't have good
17:54 numbers to to to give more accurate
17:57 estimates uh um even though we know that
18:01 the situation is dire because the
18:03 international unit for conservation of
18:05 nature Red List which is the official
18:07 organization that tracks the
18:09 biodiversity of the world it's called
18:11 the biodiversity monitor of the
18:13 planet um you know the biodiversity in
18:17 general is the who where when like what
18:20 are the species where they are and what
18:24 what are the the the population trends
18:27 of the species and
18:29 so the of the species that IU and redist
18:33 monitors and this is the organization
18:35 that when we say the species are
18:37 endangered it's because the species
18:39 commission for UC and red list for that
18:41 species using some metrics determine
18:44 that that's the the status of the
18:46 species so they need data to do
18:49 this so more than half of the species
18:53 that they track currently and that's
18:55 about 160,000 also not a big number um
18:59 are either data deficient so they don't
19:02 have metrics enough to determine
19:03 anything or
19:06 um the the population friend isn't known
19:10 these are not obscure species so killer
19:12 whale orcas the largest dolphin in the
19:15 in
19:16 the in the ocean the largest dolphin in
19:19 the world killer whales they they're
19:23 data deficient I mean you if you cannot
19:26 tell me anything about killer whales
19:30 I mean they're hard to miss when they're
19:32 in the
19:32 ocean right um especially when they
19:35 attack boats now no in Spain how can we
19:39 actually use technology to exactly there
19:43 are there are whales yes and we cannot
19:45 miss them when them when we are on a
19:47 ship but like still how can
19:52 we question deficiency and the
19:57 population is not known so how can we
19:58 use technology to actually measure that
20:02 that's exactly where we decided okay
20:03 we're going to do something about it
20:05 because you know polar bears population
20:08 trend is unknown I'm like are you
20:10 kidding me this is the the conservation
20:12 icon right of of the world polar bears
20:15 so if we don't know anything about
20:18 species like orcus and polar bears we
20:20 really are in in a bad situation so over
20:22 the last 20 years clearly technology has
20:25 exploded uh you know we have remote
20:27 sensing we have auton drones right
20:29 autonomous vehicles underwat on the
20:31 ground and in the air we have sensors
20:34 that we can put on animals themselves
20:36 everything from Radio colors to you know
20:39 uh Bluetooth GPS accelerometers
20:43 everything we have inc2 sensors such as
20:46 cameras traps that are motion activated
20:48 cameras we have acoustic sensors and we
20:51 have these guys we have devices that
20:53 everybody uses to take pictures but even
20:56 with all of that so one is by far images
21:01 is the most abundant Source from all of
21:03 this but two if we look at the data of
21:05 How It's distributed it's very biased
21:08 towards North America and Europe that's
21:11 not where the highest biodiversity is
21:13 highest biodiversities in the tropics
21:15 and it's South it's um South America and
21:19 Africa by a large margin and we have
21:23 very little data from there also all the
21:26 methods for analyzing images right all
21:29 the AI and computer vision that's being
21:31 developed for image analysis if this is
21:33 what we're using as our primary source
21:36 um again the vast production is in North
21:40 America Europe and China right now of
21:43 these methods that's not where the
21:45 biodiversity is so that's like developed
21:48 in absence of the context of what's
21:50 needed for these kinds of questions and
21:53 you cannot actually just take off the
21:55 shelf methods that are out there for for
21:58 image is um and apply it directly to
22:02 questions and um biodiversity monitoring
22:06 be for many many different reasons that
22:08 I'm happy to get into in more detail so
22:12 so we need to to to Really develop
22:14 methods that are appropriate for let's
22:17 say image analysis for biodiversity
22:19 monitoring and there is a community not
22:21 a huge
22:23 Community still well under 100 if I'm
22:27 being super generous
22:30 uh that is working on developing these
22:32 methods and so methods like I mentioned
22:36 identifying individuals so that allows
22:38 us to do population count so wild book
22:41 now has been used for updating well
22:44 charar gravy zebras Simi ring seals and
22:48 Iberian links
22:49 population um
22:51 monitoring from directly from the data
22:54 in Wild uh to IU and red list so they
22:58 they status also we have now well book
23:01 for whales and dolphins so hope and and
23:05 orcas Hiller whales are now part of that
23:08 so hopefully there will be soon enough
23:10 data to reassess the population the
23:14 species status and to and and killer
23:17 Welles will be data deficient how does
23:19 actually work like is there do you use
23:23 satellite data or you use some sort of
23:25 like radio signals cuz like pictures
23:30 pictures any kind of pictures cameras uh
23:33 aerial photographs people taking
23:35 pictures when they're on whale watching
23:38 fishing boats but you cannot take
23:41 literally
23:43 pictures you can take not in the entire
23:46 ocean it's still biased towards where
23:48 the boats are where the people are right
23:50 so it's where the boats are where or or
23:53 Shores where the the whale may be where
23:56 whales try to stay away from
23:59 like there
24:00 is or maybe to some extent yes but uh
24:04 We've shown for example with whale
24:06 sharks which is the largest
24:08 fish in the
24:10 ocean the data collected by people even
24:15 though it is biased T shortes
24:18 by quite a bit uh data collected to
24:22 people uh by people including data from
24:26 social media people posting on YouTube
24:28 and other social media platforms hey we
24:31 went on this whale watching tour uh on
24:34 this whale shark swimming with whale
24:37 sharks here's my pictures here's my it
24:39 is videos so um all of these data
24:43 together improved the population size
24:46 estimate and was used in fact to uh have
24:50 the most comprehensive study uh on the
24:53 biology of whale sharks It For the First
24:56 Time revealed migration
24:59 patterns seasonality of migration
25:00 patterns of the species because it you
25:04 know people knew but we never had enough
25:06 data to show that they travel 5,000
25:08 miles these are Global species you can
25:11 identify the same whale shark in Cancun
25:13 in in uh and then in the Philippines and
25:18 because we can identify yes it's the
25:20 same animal from the spot pattern of
25:22 this of of the
25:24 Sharks we can now know how far they
25:27 travel what's the pattern of that travel
25:30 as a global species there is not one
25:33 project not one organization that have
25:35 data on even one individual so you have
25:37 to put together the data from the entire
25:40 Globe right to really create the picture
25:43 of a of a global species and that's what
25:45 platforms that's what technology like
25:47 this allows we really can take all
25:50 available data from the entire
25:53 world okay so if I understood correctly
25:56 so let's say there are this whales
25:59 there's already some
26:01 estimate or like I think for whales you
26:04 said it's unknown but like for for
26:06 sharks for certain sharks there's
26:08 already some estimate right and then
26:10 what you can do you can tap into social
26:13 media uh pictures or streams from these
26:17 boats or like all the
26:19 signals and you can use that and also
26:22 knowing the patterns of how these
26:23 animals travel how they
26:26 migrate you can correct or make a more
26:30 accurate estimate right yeah so the
26:33 underlying particularly so when you can
26:36 identify
26:37 individuals there is a particular method
26:40 statistical method that's used for
26:42 population size estimates so in its
26:44 capture marker
26:46 capture to explain a very very simple
26:50 situation and by the way the same
26:51 technology is used for was used for the
26:55 first ever full census of an entire
26:57 species is the endangered gravy zebra or
27:00 gravy zebra in Kenya so these are not
27:05 those are not the endangered ones the
27:07 ones behind me uh are the common zeas do
27:11 those are the ones in serengetti
27:13 thousands uh migrations with wilderbeast
27:16 and what most people what most people
27:18 think when they sing
27:20 zebra they're not the the common ones
27:22 are not endangered and they are found
27:24 throughout the entire continent of
27:26 Africa there are two other species of
27:28 zebras left that are both are endangered
27:30 and one of them is gravy zebra uh mostly
27:33 found in zoos outside of Kenya and a
27:36 little bit in Ethiopia and so these are
27:39 beautiful uh species they look very
27:42 different smaller
27:43 Stripes thinner Stripes They're bigger
27:46 also white belly and Mickey Mouse ears
27:49 and so there was estimated that there's
27:51 about 3,000 of them left in the world
27:56 95% in Kenya
27:59 and
28:00 because we can identify individual
28:04 animals from
28:06 photographs
28:08 um the the same technology enabled for
28:11 the first time in
28:13 2016 the great gravy uh rally so that
28:17 was an event organized by the gravy
28:19 zebra cons conservation trust in Kenya
28:22 and Kenya Wildlife co-organized later
28:25 with Kenya Wildlife service which is a
28:26 government organization and Wildlife
28:29 direct an coaching
28:31 nonprofit to come together and to bring
28:35 everybody anybody tourists came uh
28:38 coming into country to to on The Safaris
28:41 but also Kenyans school kids um the the
28:45 the park rangers
28:47 volunteers and you know even US
28:49 ambassador to Kenya at the time
28:51 participated so we had about uh hundreds
28:56 of people resulted in for two days
28:58 driving around the country taking
29:00 picture of every gravy zebra they saw
29:03 and anything else they
29:04 wanted and then in two days that
29:08 resulted in 40,000 images of
29:13 zebras
29:15 so what you can do then you can make a
29:18 simple assumption that in two
29:20 days there are few very few To None
29:23 death birth you know immigration
29:26 immigration of of so it's a close
29:30 population and let's say on the first
29:33 day you
29:34 saw uh you saw a uh thousand
29:40 zebras and then so you know you
29:43 essentially let's say you spray paint
29:44 them with pink color you shouldn't but
29:47 let's say you spray paint them on the
29:49 second day you go out and you do the
29:51 same thing you try to photograph every
29:53 zebra and you end up with
29:58 another uh maybe 500 but of those
30:03 500 uh 50 are spray painted
30:07 pink right so that what it tells you is
30:10 that on any random on any day if you go
30:14 out to see zebras assuming that it's the
30:15 close
30:16 population um you see about 10% of the
30:22 population right at random because you
30:24 saw on the second day you saw 50 of the
30:26 500 were were
30:28 marked so so means that you randomly see
30:32 about 10% of the population so this so
30:35 This 500 represents about 10% of the
30:39 total so your estimate should be about
30:42 5,000 okay works for most animals I
30:46 guess for most species right this works
30:49 if you can cap if you can mark them when
30:51 you capture them right and what used to
30:54 be done it literally people would
30:58 capture animals animals to tag them
31:01 somehow like it's often done with mice
31:03 it's often done with like small animals
31:06 and and people or Birds they put tags
31:09 rings on birds and so that you can do
31:12 the Testament but then it also works if
31:14 you have a close population but there
31:16 are versions of this model that works
31:18 for open population when you can take
31:20 into account birth death immigration
31:22 immigration over a long period of time
31:25 the nice part about being able to
31:27 recognize individual animals from
31:29 photographs is that you don't have to
31:31 capture them anymore it's not invasive
31:33 you're essentially marking them by
31:34 identifying you take a picture that's
31:36 your capture you mark them by
31:39 identifying who that individual is not
31:42 just a zebra but that zi of the zebra
31:44 that's Zoe the Zebra that's Zach the
31:45 zebra right and so then when you take a
31:48 picture again patterns or what yes they
31:51 have unique patterns like your
31:54 fingerprint okay and so on the second
31:56 day when you if somebody else takes a
31:58 picture of the same zebra we know it's
32:00 the same zebra so that's the recapture
32:03 and we knew that by the second mid
32:05 morning of the second day there were no
32:08 photographs essentially of any new
32:10 animals every zebra that was
32:12 photographable that anybody saw was
32:15 already
32:16 photographed so that gives you amazing
32:19 confidence bounds for population size
32:21 estimat because you know essentially
32:24 that you have a photograph of every
32:26 zebra that's out there that wasn't too
32:29 shy to be photographed so then the
32:32 question is how many were not seen at
32:34 all and that's where you can
32:36 compare um from 2016 to 2018 which was
32:41 the same kind of event in 2020 and now
32:44 20124 and so we know that the
32:46 intervening years there were no zebras
32:49 that suddenly came out of the Bush to
32:51 like well you know what I did not want
32:53 to be photographed during the when there
32:55 were too many people around but now
32:57 please do to take my picture right so no
32:59 there were none of
33:00 those which answers my earlier question
33:03 about whales and them trying to stay
33:06 away from people right cuz like okay the
33:09 majority might may stay away from people
33:13 but some of them do not cuz they're
33:16 looking for food or whatever and then
33:18 like if you measure multiple times you
33:21 can see and find a way to distinguish
33:24 one um animal from another of the same
33:29 species yeah I guess whales also have a
33:31 way to tell that these two anal are
33:34 different right yeah so we we're not
33:36 asking animals we need to do it from
33:37 photographs so we need observable
33:39 features and so so for whales we have
33:42 several ways one uh some whale species
33:46 like uh uh orcas or humback whales have
33:50 distinct markings right so when you have
33:53 a picture of the tail of an animal for
33:55 humbeck whales they have black and white
33:58 kind of patterns those are unique to
34:00 every animal individual so you can use
34:03 them like a fingerprint the same way
34:04 like we do
34:05 zebras um for orcas killer whales they
34:10 have the black and white spots on them
34:12 again those are unique you actually they
34:15 uniquely identify every individual in a
34:17 pretty straightforward way and many many
34:20 many many species if you think have that
34:23 for whales like uh sperm whales so so
34:27 for whal for sperm whales sorry um they
34:30 don't actually have unique marking so we
34:31 use the shape of a whale's fluke like
34:34 that the the whales tail that edge of
34:37 the of the tail is a unique marking just
34:41 like your ear by the way the shape of
34:42 your ear that outline is unique and so
34:45 is the elephant's ear you can use that
34:47 outline when it opens I was going to ask
34:50 you about polar bears like there are no
34:52 patterns but I think you already
34:54 answered that cuz like there maybe there
34:57 are no pattern but there are other
34:58 features that we can look at
35:01 like so for bears actually and many
35:05 other forward looking animals all the be
35:08 species there's bear ID which a Canadian
35:11 couple um started as a project which
35:14 we're starting to incorporate into wild
35:16 book platforms so Bears um and a
35:21 cats dogs too but uh and and uh like old
35:26 cats kind cut all the forward-looking
35:28 animals you can also and seals you can
35:31 use um uh all the all the primat we're
35:35 actually working now with a group that
35:36 does primate fa using facial
35:39 identification so so U we can start
35:42 incorporating that and then also
35:48 um you know for many other species so we
35:51 have species on the platform we have
35:55 species like uh weedy and leafy sea
35:59 dragons these are uh horse seahorse like
36:03 relatives these guys look like aliens
36:07 and yet every single one is individually
36:10 identifiable all turtles all eight
36:13 species of turtles we have wild BG that
36:15 has Turtles the scale patterns on the
36:18 head and on their appendages are unique
36:21 after about three months of age so
36:23 there's so many many species that are
36:28 that that are uniquely identifiable in
36:30 fact you know turns out most of us are
36:34 special every animal is unique even if
36:37 we humans cannot
36:40 discern the the they Iden think Chas
36:44 like for me all chaas look the same
36:48 right but they are probably not it's
36:50 just my like I never had a dog right for
36:54 me
36:55 like okay I can tell
36:58 put from a Chihuahua right but like when
37:00 it comes to a specific breed then like
37:05 all of them look same to me right but
37:09 it's because it's because of me right
37:11 not because they are yeah so humans are
37:15 actually biased yeah humans are very
37:17 biased with our visual system so there
37:20 was a there was a a paper about a year
37:24 and a half ago showing that humans do
37:26 not have like part of it is Hardware
37:28 limitations in our in our visual system
37:31 so we do not have for example R enough
37:33 of the red orange Acuity to distinguish
37:36 uh phenotype different types of
37:39 moth like different types of moth within
37:41 one species or
37:43 butterflies because these differences do
37:46 not actually evolve for our benefit
37:48 they're for Birds right moths and
37:51 butterflies are signaling to birds so
37:53 when you translate the images into bird
37:56 acuity
37:58 uh
38:00 model machine learning has no problem
38:03 telling the differences humans
38:05 cannot so that's the advantage of using
38:09 Al Another advantage of using um
38:12 computational approaches is because
38:13 computers can look at the world from the
38:17 perspective of other species not limited
38:19 by our Hardware or software for that
38:22 matter so we even though we see the
38:25 differences between the zebra patterns
38:28 and I can and you can certainly you know
38:31 if you can if you look long enough you
38:33 can if I show you two pictures of zebras
38:36 you can tell oh yeah these are the same
38:37 these are not the same after about like
38:39 five minutes of looking at
38:41 zebras but if I ask you are these two
38:45 more similar to each other than these
38:47 two we have no way of
38:49 quantifying even though we can see that
38:51 they're different but we can't tell how
38:54 different so that part no amount of
38:59 right yeah so no amount of training will
39:02 let us do this because we evolved the
39:04 species to be able to use
39:06 space so we can say oh yeah yeah the
39:09 baby looks like Mom the baby looks like
39:11 Dad or this person looks like that
39:12 celebrity we're great at that but if I
39:15 tell you you know like is this zebra
39:17 baby zebra like who is its mom and dad
39:20 just by STP pattern or what I don't know
39:23 but computers again can quantify the
39:25 similarity of the stripe pattern
39:27 right we have computational approaches
39:29 for this and that's the advantage and so
39:31 that is also the premise of The
39:34 imic Institute and the field of science
39:37 in the geomic that we can extract
39:38 biological information such as traits
39:41 and phenotype the overall collection of
39:43 trait traits that are the product of
39:46 genes and the environment and the
39:47 interaction of those um directly
39:51 observable ones directly from image and
39:53 connect that to biological function and
39:57 so so so
39:59 because we can use computational
40:04 approaches right we can use computer to
40:07 complement what we're
40:09 seeing right and extend our ability to
40:12 see uh and to quantify what we're seeing
40:15 from images and to see in other Spectra
40:17 to see in other models to see the world
40:19 from the perspective which is
40:22 nonhuman which to me these two messages
40:26 you of one is that we can use AI we can
40:29 use computational approaches as a
40:32 partner AI truly is a partner to humans
40:35 like to complement not to take over but
40:38 to complement our
40:40 abilities to make connections among data
40:42 points among humans among different
40:44 parts of the world among you know
40:47 between a a person and
40:50 nature as well as you know to to give
40:54 us the ability to to see what we cannot
40:58 see to see what we're missing like that
41:02 to me is is you know the the the very
41:06 hopeful and and exciting aspect of the
41:10 partnership between Ai and
41:12 humans coming back to the zebras I'm
41:15 really curious how it works like let's
41:18 say we have this task of telling
41:21 if the we have a zebra and we need to
41:24 find the mama and the papa of the
41:28 based on the stripe
41:31 patterns can computers already do that
41:34 yeah so we can we can we're starting to
41:37 so uh we had a very small study
41:41 preliminary study specifically for
41:43 zebras because uh because uh the the
41:46 approach that we're using is actually
41:48 computer for zebra identification is a
41:51 computer vision Noni Approach at the
41:53 moment we're expanding it now to machine
41:55 learning to include machine learning
41:56 specific specifically for zebras um for
41:59 other species we do use machine learning
42:02 uh quite a bit but here we use approach
42:05 what known as scale and vared feature
42:06 transform shft features which are based
42:10 on the
42:13 um gradient of the pixel value
42:16 difference on the sliding Matrix across
42:19 uh across the the body of the zebras and
42:21 because they have you know black and
42:23 white patterns so it's the gradient is
42:26 is super high where that the changes are
42:29 and you can kind of create a histogram
42:32 of these changes that kind of creates a
42:34 signature for each zebra right yes it
42:37 creates a signature for each zebra for
42:40 each image and you can match the
42:42 signatures between then you have one
42:45 like vector another vector and you can
42:47 say how close these vectors are and then
42:50 this would give
42:52 us like the overall pattern similarity
42:55 right right away and like if the
42:57 patterns are similar they are probably
42:59 relatives so so we don't know nobody
43:02 knew that nobody knew whether
43:05 pattern uh stri the stripe pattern has
43:09 any kind of uh
43:12 genetic component to it whether it's
43:15 heritable in any way whether it's
43:16 inherited from a parents to baby but we
43:21 had a small data set of pictures of moms
43:23 and babies together and we could ask the
43:26 way we could ask ask is here's a picture
43:28 of a baby who is the closest adult most
43:32 similar adult in our data set to this
43:35 picture of a baby and the mom was
43:37 actually consistently in the and it's a
43:40 large population of about 3,000 so the
43:42 mom was consistently in the top 10 and
43:47 like quite often majority in the top
43:48 three so that's a signal that yeah
43:51 there's there's something there so now
43:53 we're actually collecting genetic data
43:55 so we can directly correlate with we've
43:57 done a similar pilot study on leopards
44:00 Indian
44:00 leopards uh and there the facial
44:03 information was the most relevant so uh
44:07 the patterns around the face and then we
44:10 also did did a similar study on bird
44:13 eggs and so so why bird eggs because
44:17 Birds a visual species and they
44:20 recognize eggs that are theirs versus
44:24 not theirs purely by sight
44:28 so people uh researchers have done the
44:31 the studies is it the shape is it the
44:34 texture is it the smell is it anything
44:36 else other than sight and the answer is
44:38 absolutely not you can put a 3D printed
44:41 egg with a pattern that is similar to
44:45 theirs they will accept it and the
44:48 pattern that's too far from theirs on
44:50 the egg they will kick it out of the
44:52 nest interesting so they're using egg
44:55 have no patterns they do do so so many
44:58 eggs do have patterns uh you're thinking
45:01 chicken uh this is not chicken this is
45:03 uh other species so um most eggs
45:06 actually have
45:08 spots like qu eggs for example no way of
45:13 determine if it's uh they do they do uh
45:17 but they they they also have color so
45:19 what like chickens that are not bred for
45:23 genetic similarity which is production
45:26 production and animals very quickly
45:29 start you know from brown blue brown
45:33 blue
45:34 greenish like all the chicken have the
45:37 specific gome right
45:40 jeans yeah so so so they're bread the
45:43 breeds are the industrial production
45:45 breed are very close why the eggs are
45:48 it's like they're all
45:50 siblings not quite but yeah close and so
45:53 so there's not a high diversity there in
45:55 general so they're not good model for
45:58 studying
45:59 relatedness and uh they're also
46:02 nonparasitic so they're not species that
46:06 need to recognize their eggs they're in
46:08 fact bred to like sit you know like the
46:10 eggs are taken away from them generally
46:14 so um that there they few ones that will
46:18 you know bring their tcks to um to to
46:23 the point where they break out of the
46:25 egg but uh with wild species of
46:29 birds especially the ones that have like
46:32 cucko parasitize uh other species so
46:37 they will lay eggs in other species
46:39 nests and trick uh the host to raise
46:42 them with their own so spe so birds that
46:46 have the danger right of of somebody
46:49 else laying eggs in there they they're
46:51 like nope no no no no no they learn how
46:53 to differentiate like really and by
46:56 learn if evolutionarily over millions of
46:58 years they evolve to know how to
47:01 recognize eggs from theirs versus not
47:04 their their
47:05 nest and so all the birds apparently
47:09 because not all yes so not all the birds
47:12 not all the species but so the question
47:14 is for the species that do do that well
47:18 how do they do this right and if you
47:20 look at this so we worked with uh Mark
47:22 halber who is a AR neologist who who
47:25 specializes in um um in eggs and wrote
47:29 the book literally called
47:32 eggs it's a thck book so so so there
47:37 there pictures of there pictures of of
47:41 uh eggs from about 80 nest and uh we
47:46 could not only train not only we could
47:49 train an algorithm uh a model machine
47:52 learning model to differentiate between
47:55 Nest we could ALS also gener use
47:57 generative AI to generate a Ness a an
48:01 egg that looks like this so we before I
48:04 get there we also show that it
48:07 correlates highly with genetic
48:10 relatedness so the eggs of the same bird
48:13 of course a very close together in
48:16 similarity the same bird over
48:19 years you know are also
48:22 Clos uh a mom and the and her daughter
48:26 are closer than any random bird and so
48:29 on so there is a strong genetic
48:31 signal um there's also we could you know
48:35 then generate an egg that looks like an
48:38 egg from the nest and 3D printed and ask
48:41 a bird would you take it right and so
48:44 then we can start this is the future we
48:47 can start generating eggs gradually sort
48:50 of between One S Nest than another and
48:53 see at what point the bird would start
48:55 rejecting the egg
48:57 literally drawing isol lines of sort of
49:00 kin recognition of what is still work in
49:02 progress right you haven't this is work
49:04 in progress we show that there is
49:06 genetic
49:07 relatedness there's strong correlation
49:10 between the the genetic relatedness and
49:12 the Egg similarity something that humans
49:15 cannot do without the help of a computer
49:18 right but um the the sort of the next
49:22 step of asking the bird directly is is
49:27 the is the future is what it's work in
49:29 progress but that's that's an example of
49:32 where we can
49:35 really you know
49:37 use machine learning right
49:40 AI um and computation approaches to do
49:43 something that humans absolutely cannot
49:45 do and understand
49:49 biology I'm just curious like why okay
49:52 this is a very interesting experiment we
49:54 generate with a eye a neck and place it
49:57 put it uh to the nest to see if the bird
50:01 rejects it or not this is uh this sounds
50:04 like a lot of fun but like what are the
50:06 practical implications of that
50:08 experiment like what does it give us
50:11 knowing that okay the bird rejects this
50:13 SE or or does not reject this SE basic
50:16 understanding of the world of you know
50:18 this is basic science so understanding
50:21 how kin selection how do birds recognize
50:24 Inc recognition how do birds recognize
50:26 who is there who is not in a species
50:29 that we cannot at all replicate right we
50:32 cannot do by just observation um it
50:36 also uh gives us Insight in general how
50:39 the skin recognition work in and um in
50:43 nature do different animals use
50:45 different smells why does it matter
50:47 right why do they have that so this is
50:51 about Fitness it's about uh uh how we
50:55 ensure that our offsprings right survive
50:58 better than somebody else's why would I
51:01 invest any effort into raising somebody
51:03 else's kids in is if I am a bird um and
51:07 so so this is basic
51:10 science uh to push back in a little bit
51:12 that everything has to have practical
51:14 implications because we start out with a
51:16 curiosity about the world science basic
51:19 science is a human endeavor of
51:21 understanding the world that is out
51:23 there right by humans for humans a child
51:27 asks why is the sky blue it is a basic
51:31 curiosity question without worrying
51:33 whether it's a chemistry question
51:34 physics question cognition Vision uh
51:38 psychology right it is basic human
51:41 curiosity that drives us to understand
51:43 the world and it doesn't worry
51:46 whether you know it's a it's it has some
51:49 practical implication it's the drive to
51:51 know now having said that yeah um
51:57 understanding how the world Works
51:59 particularly how different
52:02 species uh perceive the world how does
52:05 species interaction happen also helps us
52:08 this is the Practical part understands
52:10 what drives the loss of biodiversity and
52:13 what will happen if the conditions
52:15 change what will happen if the
52:19 habitats uh are smaller what will happen
52:21 if environmental conditions change right
52:24 so we can start building models that
52:25 predict how the species will respond
52:28 what will happen if uh the the
52:32 the butterflies disappear from this
52:35 particular region and move a little bit
52:36 north because it's warmer up there right
52:39 what will happen to the birds that are
52:41 relying on these
52:43 butterflies right for for food and so
52:46 on because like um I was also while you
52:50 were answering the curiosity is like a
52:52 perfect uh reason to do that cuz right
52:55 now I'm super curious what actually will
52:58 happen when you do that um but also when
53:02 thinking about the previous examples
53:03 that you g gave about
53:06 um estimating the number of zebras of a
53:10 specific breed right specific type or
53:14 counting polar bears or because you want
53:16 to see population uh Trends right is it
53:20 uh decreasing increasing stay same right
53:23 and if it's decreasing then it gives us
53:25 a clear signal okay something needs to
53:27 happen somehow want to save it right if
53:30 it's increasing then okay that's good um
53:34 and I guess this is the main uh of what
53:38 we talked about this is the main outcome
53:40 right so then now we have a more uh a
53:43 better way of doing this these things
53:47 better than did
53:49 before do you actually collaborate with
53:51 um because like okay now you have this
53:54 method how
53:57 it's being used right now like are you
54:01 extensively extensively collaborates so
54:04 it's used by hundreds of conservation
54:07 organizations around the world wild book
54:09 has more than 70 species now um and it's
54:13 used by K by government organizations
54:16 including Kenya Wildlife service um
54:18 Africa Wildlife Foundation um the the uh
54:23 the entirety of North American catalog
54:27 is on the platform so that's all of the
54:30 data from the US Bureau of ocean energy
54:33 management and the National Oceanic
54:35 atmospheric agency Noah and Bo Bo and
54:38 Noah um the Canadian whale data is up
54:43 there so this is now used as the
54:47 distintive source of data for many many
54:50 species so the ability and and the
54:53 moment you have a platform right that
54:55 organizes your data by
54:57 individual um for for example for Wales
55:02 even though the platform became live in
55:06 2014 uh agencies and project and
55:09 organizations have uploaded their
55:10 historic data going back to
55:13 mid90s right so now they can see the
55:15 whole population Trend and see how start
55:17 analyzing how it changes with different
55:20 conditions in the area and what are the
55:21 patterns of migration as I said and
55:23 things like that and so in combining
55:26 data from different sources because it's
55:29 linked on an individual ID right so you
55:31 can see oh the same whale in your data
55:33 set it's the same one in my data set
55:36 right here so look how how she moved
55:38 around and so and look who she's hanging
55:40 out with and look at all her Offspring
55:42 oh my God I knew that these are her
55:44 three calves but he also recorded these
55:46 two are also her her children great so
55:49 we now can start understanding also the
55:51 genetics a little bit and and and which
55:54 which Offspring survive and when there
55:57 is a story right now with a beluga wh
55:59 who died while giving birth and like
56:02 they think that the calf is also going
56:03 not going to survive but these are U you
56:06 know these are endangered species so so
56:10 uh and it's like one makes a story now
56:12 you have a more complete picture of a
56:14 species with these kinds of data and and
56:18 and essentially it is it's a data story
56:22 right it's a story where the dat data is
56:27 abundant and it's out there and it
56:29 wasn't yet leveraged well by providing
56:32 an ability to extract information from
56:34 images not only we can now process a lot
56:37 of data that's already out there but we
56:40 also it's a such a low barrier for entry
56:43 a three-year-old can take a picture and
56:46 contribute right and it's like everybody
56:50 can press that button or touch that
56:52 screen and so that allows contributions
56:55 from people who weren't even aware they
56:57 could contribute to science the bot that
57:00 we built for uh social media when it
57:04 finds for example uh videos of whale
57:08 sharks um and automatically sort of add
57:11 them to to the wild book for sharks and
57:13 post them in the comments hey two
57:15 minutes 46 seconds we found this uh
57:18 video of a whale shark here's everything
57:20 we know about it you just contributed to
57:22 conservation people respond people get
57:25 excited and it's like oh my God this is
57:27 amazing I didn't even know I could uh I
57:30 could do this uh how can I help right so
57:33 that immediately brings them into this
57:35 connection yeah I'm looking at the
57:38 questions that Johanna has prepared and
57:40 it's pity that
57:42 uh um our interviews over and maybe
57:47 we'll get to
57:49 ask you then some um later um maybe last
57:54 one before or you brush into your car to
57:59 watch the eclipse um are there any books
58:02 that talk about Ai and uh conservation
58:06 and
58:08 Wildlife so it's new as we started at
58:10 the beginning of this uh really at the
58:13 beginning of the the talk of the
58:17 conversation there's um not a lot yet of
58:22 AI in conservation and in fact and and
58:25 so there very few
58:27 books or written material in general so
58:31 but recently very recently just
58:35 published a
58:36 report um led by the global partnership
58:39 on AI and that's an
58:42 organization that is essentially that
58:44 brings together researchers experts in
58:47 in in different field fields subfields
58:49 of AI and publishes kind of a reports
58:53 and and engages the global policymaking
58:55 communi so uh I was part of the report
58:58 on AI and biodiversity they have other
59:00 Ai and reports and so that's a report
59:04 that was published in November uh 2022
59:08 2023 um and
59:12 uh the
59:14 the outlines both the challenges and
59:18 opportunities for AI in uh biodiversity
59:23 and so
59:25 this a link yeah in the
59:28 description yes there is also a review
59:32 of machine learning
59:35 for um machine learning methods uh
59:39 for uh conservation that's also a couple
59:43 of years old we're writing a we're about
59:45 to write a new one um there's not that
59:48 many people as I said of what's going
59:51 out there but uh certainly the
59:55 challenges so urgent and so big that you
59:57 know like coming over everybody um
1:00:02 there's a lot lot lot to do and so the
1:00:05 the report probably outlines quite a bit
1:00:08 of the opportunities that's in that's in
1:00:10 this area the link in the
1:00:12 description and yeah we should wrap up
1:00:16 so thanks a lot t for joining us today
1:00:19 for sharing all your experience for
1:00:21 telling all the stories and um now I
1:00:24 also know that zebras are not horses I
1:00:26 had no idea I thought it's
1:00:28 like horses too two they're two uh
1:00:33 species so these guys are closer to
1:00:35 dunkeys and the endangered ones are
1:00:37 closer to
1:00:39 horses okay so thanks a lot and yeah
1:00:41 enjoy the
1:00:43 eclipse thank you and thank you for
1:00:46 having me and giving me opportunity to
1:00:47 chat about Ai and biodiversity and
1:00:50 consulation thank you
