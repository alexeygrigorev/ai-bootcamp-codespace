0:58 a little bit I hope it's okay
1:00 it will not interfere with our
1:03 interview uh but anyways um everything
1:07 is great right now I'm going yeah I'm
1:09 going to open the
1:12 document with questions that we prepared
1:15 for
1:18 you and if you're ready we can
1:22 start ready awesome y let's
1:26 start this week we'll talk about
1:28 competitive machine learning and
1:29 teaching and we have a special guest
1:31 today Alexander Alexander is a machine
1:33 learning engineer with 10 plus years of
1:35 experience he's also a k kago Grant
1:38 Master ranked fifth globally and the
1:41 teacher to more than 100,000 students
1:46 It's amazing And as a teacher myself I
1:48 can really appreciate the like the
1:52 number and also the effort so it will be
1:54 very interesting for me to talk about
1:55 that personally okay and Alexander also
1:58 leads data science and software
2:00 engineering teams and contributes to
2:02 open source machine learning tools so
2:04 welcome to the interview Alexander yeah
2:06 hi uh thank you for having me really
2:09 great to talk to you today and uh I just
2:12 want to also say thank uh I want to
2:15 thank uh Marina uh I don't know if she's
2:18 watching right now for making sure we
2:20 get in touch so for me actually I've
2:23 been following your work for quite some
2:26 time and uh more than 10 years actually
2:29 so
2:30 long time because like when you were
2:32 active on kagle I was also active on
2:33 kagle so for me it's actually a good
2:36 moment to be able to talk to you so
2:38 thanks Marina and also the questions for
2:41 today's interview are as always prepared
2:43 by Johanna Bay thanks Johanna for your
2:45 help so before we go into talking about
2:49 teaching and competitive machine
2:50 learning let's start with your
2:52 background can you tell us about your
2:54 career Journey so far yeah sure so uh my
2:57 career started I guess about 10 years
3:00 ago uh when I was like a student at the
3:03 University here in Moscow and uh I was
3:07 looking for an opportunity to learn
3:08 machine learning because I thought it's
3:10 kind of exciting New Field was pretty
3:13 new I guess years ago and uh I found
3:18 that opportunity on Kegel then I moved
3:20 to Industry I worked as data analyst uh
3:23 at some ad classifier company then is
3:26 data scientist and uh right handling
3:28 right sharing services
3:30 uh in Yandex then at mechanic AI which
3:34 was startup focused on bringing machine
3:37 learning to Industrial Enterprises like
3:39 factories plants uh like we flew to like
3:43 some small cities in Siberia to find
3:46 like prod engineers and plans to figure
3:48 out whether they need our machine
3:50 learning or not and eventually I was I
3:54 worked at iterative uh which is like
3:57 company Venture startup uh San Francisco
4:01 they create open source uh tools for
4:03 machine learning engineers and data
4:05 scientists and after that I moved uh
4:09 here back in Moscow to work at Central
4:11 University it's a new uh kind of
4:14 University here which I me is
4:17 interesting because uh always education
4:20 was my hobby I was teaching like for
4:22 almost 10 years now uh and uh finally
4:26 that H became uh like my my career
4:30 full-time
4:33 job and since you mentioned iterative so
4:35 I just wanted I don't know if your
4:37 colleagues or ex- colleagues from
4:38 iterative are watching this now or will
4:40 be just want to say I just want to thank
4:42 you thank them uh CU at some point
4:45 iterative was supporting this community
4:47 and uh um because of their support it
4:51 was possible to grow the community to
4:53 bring it to the place where it is right
4:55 now so if they're watching it right now
4:57 so I want to say thank you so and I
5:00 think when we collaborated you were
5:02 actually a part of the team right yeah
5:04 yeah there was a talk uh another like
5:08 one friend of mine melnikov was giv a
5:10 talk at your podcast or like some other
5:14 event you were hosting on a tool we were
5:17 building we were building MLM like a
5:19 tool for deploy ml models yeah
5:22 yeah yeah it was right so it's a sound
5:27 that a cat mix or what like I think that
5:28 is like a weird
5:30 uh uh it's an interesting uh origin for
5:34 the name right yeah yeah yeah so there
5:36 is an internet map meme when a dog
5:39 sticks his tongue out it does like this
5:41 with with his tongue or or a cat and
5:44 that that's called m
5:47 y yeah we were trying to be
5:53 funny um are you still doing anything um
5:57 when it comes to open source uh uh not
6:00 right now yeah mostly I did that when I
6:03 was working at
6:06 iterative okay okay and you mentioned
6:10 you started your career as a student 10
6:12 years ago and it was with kagle so for
6:15 me personally kagle was a place I don't
6:17 know if I actually pronounce it
6:18 correctly kagle or kle anyways so this
6:21 this is the platform for competitive
6:23 machine learning uh which yeah which
6:26 hosts machine learning competition so
6:27 there is like uh it is
6:30 and you prepare a model and the model
6:33 needs to be as good as possible so for
6:35 me it was actually the way in data
6:38 science too and um I was already working
6:42 as a data
6:43 scientist and then I uh was lucky to
6:47 work with also a person who was active
6:51 on kagle who introduced me abishek um
6:55 and yeah for me this opened like a new
6:58 world of kagle and was like Wow awesome
7:01 uh and for me the first thing was
7:04 like I thought I'm good at machine
7:07 learning I was good at machine learning
7:10 but when I attempted my first kaggle
7:12 competition I found out that I don't
7:14 know anything and for me it was like
7:18 um I don't know refreshing cuz like I my
7:21 model like I studied two years I studied
7:24 machine learning and things like that
7:26 and then I take part in my first
7:28 competition and then like uh I
7:31 overfit a lot and my model was like
7:34 somewhere on the bottom of the
7:35 leaderboard and it was like okay that's
7:39 interesting and then I started doing
7:41 more and more and then of course your
7:42 name at some point started to appear cuz
7:45 you were doing very well there like you
7:48 were ranking quite high in these
7:50 competitions you were getting a lot of
7:52 gold
7:52 medals
7:54 so I I can really appreciate like I know
7:57 it's not easy it's very difficult to be
8:00 uh to get good positions there so tell
8:02 us how it actually started and how did
8:04 you manage to be quite good at
8:08 that uh yeah so like it started um I was
8:15 I was studying at University and I was
8:18 required to select uh like Scientific
8:20 Advisor and a lab where I can like write
8:25 my bachelor diploma and I just selected
8:28 machine learning lab because
8:30 it was really kind of fascinating for me
8:32 among everything I saw uh so I decided
8:36 to to try but I quickly figured out that
8:40 uh it's it's pretty
8:42 hard and we we we had uh like amazing
8:47 lecturers uh amazing teachers but the
8:50 problem was that uh they taught like
8:52 theory of machine learning and it was
8:55 really hard for me to understand
8:57 everything there are like a lot of
8:58 mathematics a lot of of like everything
9:00 going on and I was trying to find out
9:05 some place where I can uh test my
9:07 practical skills learn something I
9:09 didn't uh didn't know anything at that
9:11 point so I found kagle and then we had a
9:15 great uh like keggle community in Moscow
9:19 you you should recall like a kle club
9:22 like M training at Yandex uh then there
9:25 was like great Alexander diakonov who
9:28 Tau us uh you had
9:32 weekly uhuh I think you had weekly uh
9:36 sessions where you talked about
9:38 Solutions like how somebody approached
9:41 the problem so they would share the
9:42 solution uh with everyone right and this
9:45 way you uh had some ideas of what to do
9:49 right I I think I watched a few of them
9:52 in the recording back then yeah yeah so
9:55 there were like weekly sessions and uh
9:58 it was really
10:00 important that some people that won this
10:02 competition that came and explain how
10:04 they did that and how they approach the
10:06 problem sometimes someone just uh like
10:10 wants to tell about new I don't know
10:12 framework on GitHub so he comes and
10:15 explain it and it was really really
10:17 interesting and really
10:20 insightful yeah and it just uh I just
10:25 spent a lot of time on that so uh I
10:28 guess uh it was my third year or fourth
10:31 year in University and I ski I was
10:34 skipping most of my lectures and uh
10:36 classes at University I was just so
10:40 competitions so there is there is
10:42 actually one secret you need to put a
10:44 lot of time in
10:47 something yeah so skipping lectures
10:52 H that's the
10:55 secret okay like but you didn't get
10:58 kicked out of the University right I was
11:01 lucky you managed to stay yep you was so
11:06 what's the secret like how did you
11:07 manage to both compete on kagle and stay
11:11 at University without getting kicked out
11:15 I guess uh it was like it it was due to
11:19 the educational system we have uh here
11:22 in in in my University you headed so
11:24 when you can skip most of your your work
11:27 during semester and then you need to
11:29 hard like really hard prepare prepare to
11:33 your exams and then go and just pass
11:36 them yeah that was okay yeah in Germany
11:40 it's actually similar uh so when I was
11:43 doing my masters uh so what matters is
11:46 how well you pass the exam it doesn't
11:47 matter how well you studied uh during
11:50 the semester right mhm yeah yeah yeah
11:53 it's mostly doesn't matter like maybe
11:55 now it's changing actually the
11:57 educational system here is changing so
11:59 it makes sense uh when like it matters
12:03 for you to to do something during the
12:07 semester sorry I need to quot this
12:09 because yeah
12:17 yeah okay so now you're not um becoming
12:21 blind because of the right mhm
12:26 good um so you said the secret was uh
12:30 putting a lot of time in these
12:32 competitions and actually I can confirm
12:34 that like uh I did well in one of um in
12:37 one competition it was competition about
12:40 duplicated DET
12:41 action Y and this competition uh was by
12:46 Vita yes exactly and so this competition
12:49 was
12:50 uh for three months so the duration was
12:54 3 months and um so I started almost like
12:58 on the first
13:00 week and continue taking part in these
13:03 competitions like for all three months
13:06 and like every week I would put a lot of
13:08 effort in this and only this way I
13:10 manage to stay on top cuz like if I
13:13 don't put in any effort then somebody
13:15 you know takes
13:17 over so only by consistently putting I
13:22 don't know five plus uh or even more 10
13:25 plus uh hours of work per week I only
13:29 managed to do this and this is super
13:31 difficult and like but the amount of
13:33 things I learned there was insane like I
13:36 think you can confirm right yeah yeah I
13:39 think this is one of the great benefits
13:41 of kagal yeah like if you put aside like
13:45 winning gold
13:47 medals like to it just makes your kind
13:50 of your understanding of machine
13:51 learning feel broad you learned a lot of
13:53 new Frameworks domains tasks and I think
13:56 it's something really really helpful
13:58 that Keo gives to
14:02 mhm for how long did you do this cuz
14:04 like for me only one competition I could
14:07 I could do only one competition this way
14:09 cuz I was exhausted and I thought like I
14:11 don't want to see kagle again yeah yeah
14:13 but you had the job but you you you
14:14 managed to continue
14:17 yeah yeah I I didn't and uh I I think it
14:22 was around a year about a year of this
14:27 so that was a lot yeah eventually I
14:29 managed to find my first job and still
14:32 participate in kagle but it was much
14:34 harder and my first job was like 3 days
14:37 a week H so I still had
14:41 time okay was it the data analyst
14:44 position or something else yeah yeah
14:45 yeah at Avita actually at Avita yeah and
14:51 this duplicates actually like it it
14:53 helped
14:54 me throughout my career so like I was uh
14:59 doing some site Consulting because
15:00 people found me on kagle on this
15:03 competition then at work I was working
15:05 at oix which is um which at some point
15:08 uh was the mother company of avito where
15:11 I also had to deal with the duplicates
15:13 so it was like super uh just one
15:16 competition was so useful um do you
15:19 remember your first
15:21 competition uh I guess my like very
15:24 first competition was something like
15:26 Titanic or first C type prediction know
15:29 those competitions when you know the
15:30 ground proof you can just download it
15:32 from the Internet it's just kind of for
15:35 playground um I I so let's say your
15:38 first serious competition yeah my one of
15:42 the first competitions I mean maybe it
15:44 wasn't first but uh at all like first
15:48 serious one but the first I won at it
15:51 was half year after I started actually
15:54 so it was first but it was at crowd
15:57 analytics platform the were this there
16:00 was this platform inan platform uh the
16:03 quality of competitions wasn't as high
16:06 as on kagal but there were a lot of them
16:09 and uh the like they were less uh like
16:15 cool people participating it was easier
16:18 and uh that competition I remember uh
16:21 the training set was pretty small so it
16:23 it's a kind of weird competition when
16:25 you are given just like 300 points in
16:28 training data and maybe 100 points and
16:30 test data so it's
16:32 really luck a matter of luck and I
16:35 managed to train like 300 models like
16:38 you know in live and out
16:40 fashion and then uh make a staking uh
16:43 over it and I thought it was really cool
16:48 but I don't think it
16:50 was no yeah but it was fun so like three
16:55 300 points data points and 300 models
16:58 yeah yep
17:00 yep
17:02 amazing speaking of like I remember so
17:05 that my solution was also not something
17:06 you can easily put to production cuz it
17:08 was like
17:10 uh two layers or three layers of
17:13 stacking which is not really um useful
17:17 let's say
17:19 uh but still you learn a lot from
17:23 competing right yeah yeah you do you do
17:26 and eventually you you are getting
17:28 usually you're getting bored to it's
17:30 getting boring to build this teing so
17:32 you trying to find simpler solutions
17:34 that
17:36 work yeah at some point and like do you
17:38 have any yeah sorry please continue ah
17:41 yeah at some point I remember uh there
17:43 were some competitions where like top
17:45 places were taken by people with huge
17:48 ensembles uh like a lot of Sten layers
17:51 but there were some there always was
17:53 some uh smart guy on the like I know
17:56 let's say 10th Place who like trying the
17:59 single model and still managed to be the
18:02 10th and that was really awesome to to
18:04 read these solutions to understand how
18:06 people think uh what they
18:10 Doh did you do anything special to
18:12 prepare for this like you mentioned tal
18:15 trainings you mentioned reading
18:17 Solutions um did you do anything
18:20 else uh in general uh I guess uh you
18:24 just need to iterate I mean I just was
18:26 iterating when you like solve one dozen
18:29 of competitions it's much easier to
18:31 solve the next dozen U yeah it's uh I I
18:35 don't think you really need to prepare
18:37 to K competitions like in advance
18:40 because they they as you said they can
18:43 take like three months so you have
18:45 plenty of time uh during the competition
18:49 but it's always like useful to prepare
18:51 for let's say hacks when you have just
18:53 two days and uh it worth to set up like
18:56 infrastructure I know rent a server
18:59 baselines learn from organizers what
19:01 type of problem uh there will be if you
19:04 can and uh just I don't know read some
19:06 tutorials about the
19:09 problem do you take part in
19:12 hakon uh I did yeah earlier but now I'm
19:16 mostly on on the other part on the part
19:18 of
19:22 organizers yeah we will talk about that
19:24 too like I'll take a note um but so you
19:30 took part in Gaggle competitions you
19:32 were pretty successful
19:34 there and um yeah you also put a lot of
19:38 effort there and at some point you move
19:41 to
19:42 Industry um so how exactly kagle was
19:46 helpful cuz we also talked about you
19:48 know all these ensembles that are not
19:50 realistic people in real life don't do
19:52 that uh people sometimes like there's
19:54 other um there are other things like
19:57 people use leaks people use you know
20:00 other things that you're not supposed to
20:02 use and you cannot use in
20:04 production uh yet despite all these
20:06 critics there are still a lot of useful
20:08 things that you get off kagle from kagle
20:12 what were for you these useful things
20:14 and how exactly it help you get your
20:17 first
20:18 job uh I guess uh like there are few
20:22 things that uh K will help help you with
20:25 the first is uh like really broadening
20:28 your perspective on machine learning
20:29 like when you solve dozen or maybe
20:32 couple of dozen competitions then you
20:35 know like different domains different
20:37 models different Frameworks and that's
20:40 that's really great because when you
20:41 come to your job and you see some
20:43 problem you already know how to how to
20:45 try to tackle
20:46 it and uh that also helps you to choose
20:49 your first job so for example when you
20:51 come to interview they ask you okay did
20:53 you solve any camp like any practical
20:56 task and uh for example we are having
20:59 such kind of task at the company and
21:02 then you can tell yeah I I was holding
21:04 this kind of task already on G it's not
21:08 like yeah as important but still and uh
21:12 the other thing I think kle is helpful
21:14 uh is kind of trying to learn some
21:18 special things about the data for
21:19 example as leaks you said leaks aren't
21:21 useful in production but you do these
21:24 kind of mistakes yourself so when you
21:26 build your solution sometimes you just
21:28 uh add like ground truth somehow to your
21:31 training set and then you push this to
21:33 production and you see it doesn't work
21:36 and you're trying to debug it and uh
21:38 when you're on kegle you're solving
21:39 competitions you find these leaks uh you
21:42 really kind of trying to understand how
21:44 people on the other side can do
21:47 them so this is helpful and of course
21:50 kegle is great place to kind of talk to
21:53 other people learn something from them
21:55 maybe build your public profile this
21:56 also helps and
22:00 um I got to Avita thanks to competitions
22:02 as well so I had some uh like friends in
22:06 this ml Community like M trov who
22:10 invited me to get an interview to avito
22:12 and uh well uh I was successful and I I
22:16 started internship
22:20 there yeah interesting and do you think
22:22 it's still useful today so compared to
22:27 10 uh eight years ago when we were
22:31 starting our data science career
22:33 compared to those times do you think
22:34 it's still useful to take part in
22:36 competitions and specifically kagle uh
22:38 or there are other better ways of you
22:42 know kickstarting your data science
22:45 career I think it's it's a great
22:47 question and it really as you said it
22:49 just depends on I mean as you said there
22:52 are different ways there are always
22:54 alternative right and it really depends
22:56 on what what alternatives are available
22:59 for you so uh if you are from I don't
23:03 know for example from Kazakhstan I'm
23:05 initially from Kazakhstan and there is
23:08 uh not a lot of uh not many places you
23:11 can get great education machine learning
23:14 so kegle is still valuable and uh also
23:18 Kegel has another plus it's
23:20 International so if you participate in
23:22 Kel if you win it's great you can get a
23:25 job in another country so it's something
23:28 uh something that shows your level but
23:31 if you are like I don't know starting
23:33 your career in USA or Europe maybe
23:35 keegle is not the best option you have
23:38 actually we had like small talk with um
23:42 I know the one of the people who
23:45 organized kle Club at Oxford in UK and
23:50 he was like he he told me that there are
23:52 now a lot of interest I mean there are
23:54 people who are interested in kagle but I
23:56 I got the feeling that in Russia and
23:58 then some other countries you have more
24:01 interest in kle and I think it's because
24:04 of opportunities so if you study in
24:07 Oxford you can get I don't know to some
24:09 top AI Labs you can get to internship to
24:12 in a top company uh so why you need
24:18 K oh but also I think uh in Eastern
24:22 Europe we just like competitions like
24:25 all these olympiads uh competitions like
24:28 things like that cuz also you know there
24:30 are this programming competitions uh um
24:34 I know there are there are math
24:35 competitions and for some reasons people
24:38 in Russia and people in the neighboring
24:40 countries uh in e in in general in E
24:44 Easter Europe like those kind of things
24:47 maybe in the UK not so
24:49 much or the US yeah maybe it's because
24:52 of like strong
24:54 mathematical mathematics in school I
24:56 think
24:58 like uh it can be
25:02 correlated MH but also when studying in
25:05 Germany I noticed that uh here there was
25:09 a lot of focus on group work compared to
25:13 Russia when it was more individual maybe
25:16 it's also it also plays roles role yeah
25:20 maybe maybe I didn't think of that
25:22 that's
25:24 interesting and and speaking of that so
25:27 I see a question
25:28 um from
25:31 Asin should we do competitive machine
25:33 learning alone or should we form a team
25:36 uh I guess it's uh like it's much better
25:40 to form a team uh but not in the sense
25:44 that you I don't know you enter kaggle
25:46 and uh you build a team there uh but
25:49 rather having a community where you can
25:51 talk about this you can discuss some
25:52 ideas and stuff and because it's really
25:55 helpful um yeah it's just easier to win
25:59 even to win competition to learn is much
26:02 easier so that's what I
26:05 think mhm yeah and also cuz um like at
26:11 the end you still might need to do
26:13 stacking right and it's good when there
26:15 are multiple people in the team everyone
26:17 has their own model right and then you
26:19 combine all these models into one yeah
26:22 yeah because different people like
26:23 explore different ways different models
26:25 different solutions and even even you
26:27 may not go into St but you can just aage
26:30 predictions for example it may be
26:32 sometimes
26:34 yeah MH and I remember this iito
26:38 duplicates detection competition so the
26:40 team who won it was
26:42 um um stas who is also very famous
26:46 um yep St Sim like he competed St Stan
26:51 Stanis Simon ofia he competed in a lot
26:54 of kagle competitions back then uh so he
26:57 wasn't particularly good at computer
26:58 vision so he teamed up with a person who
27:00 was so they kind of cont they knew that
27:06 like okay I know I'm good at this one
27:08 I'm good at this thing so they United
27:10 and then they
27:12 won yep yep and they found the leak leak
27:15 agend the data I just I just remember
27:18 this course yeah now I teach school
27:22 children to kind of we have now this
27:25 International Olympiad in Ai and I teach
27:27 uh like school children in Russia how to
27:29 participate and I I was trying to create
27:33 a lesson about leakages and I found that
27:35 competition and then watched it like the
27:39 the Min
27:41 yeah school children um so
27:45 how how old are them are they uh 15
27:50 years
27:51 16 16 17 and 18 like those who are still
27:56 in school it's like High School right
27:58 yeah yeah yeah it's like uh yeah yeah if
28:01 you want to talk about this we can do it
28:02 now or later because it's it's really
28:05 interesting yeah there is you know the
28:09 were like International Olympiad in
28:11 mathematics uh in informatics and now
28:14 they're trying to create uh such kind of
28:16 Olympiad in Ai and it's really
28:19 interesting because I never thought that
28:22 there are like some school children that
28:25 can actually like solve these
28:26 competitions on such high
28:28 level so yeah because I I started my
28:32 career in data science like in 22 maybe
28:35 and I think you also like maybe a bit
28:39 later but
28:41 still yeah yeah it's really interesting
28:44 when people at 16 can solve competitions
28:47 and win
28:49 prizes yeah and I also like I'm trying
28:52 to remember
28:54 um what I knew at school so when I was
28:58 at school I could solve quadratic
29:01 equations and like some other basic
29:04 things but like machine learning no like
29:09 and we also we were learning Pascal and
29:11 Excel and Word in our classes I guess
29:15 school children these days are very
29:17 different so does it mean they learn
29:20 machine learning like in 10th or 11 gra
29:25 ah by themselves okay so it's not
29:28 thought schol yeah yeah it
29:32 isn't well not yet maybe right yeah
29:36 maybe okay how did you start your
29:39 teaching Journey like you were you said
29:42 I think you were sharing solutions from
29:45 kagle right yeah yeah so I was when I
29:49 ended up U at AI lab I was talking about
29:53 at University uh and understood there
29:56 are like a lot of theoretical machine
29:57 learning courses I was trying to find an
29:59 opportunity to learn some practical
30:01 things so I uh came up across one class
30:06 that uh Victor counter held in uh like
30:10 our University so I just come to the
30:12 class uh and uh yeah it was just like
30:16 usual class of machine learning but but
30:18 from practical perspective I just come
30:20 there came there and asked if I can join
30:23 and he told me like uh are you that guy
30:26 from Kel so you you shouldn't come to
30:30 these lectures you should teach and I'm
30:33 decided to try and uh yeah first so you
30:37 wanted to join as a student yeah yeah
30:39 yeah I wanted I
30:40 wanted amazing he said I was over
30:43 qualified I still
30:45 attended because I I wasn't over
30:47 qualified obviously I didn't know a lot
30:49 of a lot of stuff back then MH um yeah
30:54 but I I was I I was like yeah teaching
30:57 how to solve competitions even uh
31:00 doesn't win them don't win because
31:03 winning is much harder but just
31:06 solving MH and I think it also benefits
31:09 because in order to win you need to
31:11 exploit all these leaks uh build
31:13 assembles which does not uh directly
31:15 translate to you know being good at work
31:18 but just having an okay solution a good
31:21 solution that works is already super
31:24 helpful right so you kind of understand
31:25 the problem you understand what kind of
31:27 feature engineering you can do you
31:28 understand how you can do cross
31:29 validation right and once you do that
31:33 that's sufficient to actually you know
31:35 say okay now I know how to solve this
31:37 problem let's move on to another one
31:38 right yep
31:42 exactly and so it started with
31:45 you uh with that class and what happened
31:49 after that like you understood you like
31:51 teaching or what uh yeah yeah I I found
31:55 it uh like interesting and and um yeah
32:00 fulfilling in some sense so I really
32:02 like explaining people some stuff and I
32:04 like when they understand this so I was
32:08 just uh
32:09 continuing and uh also I learned that I
32:13 I wasn't good back then I wasn't good at
32:15 machine learning theory for example and
32:18 I didn't understand a lot of details
32:21 about algorithms how they work I I knew
32:25 a lot of stuff from kegle but I wasn't
32:27 good at Theory per se and I found out
32:31 that when you teach you need to figure
32:33 it out you need to understand it if you
32:36 want to come and uh explain people so it
32:40 was really stressful for me but it was
32:43 uh it was insightful so I like that as
32:48 well so the best way to learn something
32:51 is to teach yeah yeah I think that's
32:54 that's true totally
32:58 and speaking of theory so I remember so
33:00 when I had machine learning classes uh
33:02 as a student I attended them so we were
33:05 covering things like ban uh machine
33:08 learning or uh support Vector machines
33:12 or what else like I remember it was a
33:14 lot of theory and we would solve all
33:17 these uh complex equations
33:37 okay let me try to reconnect
34:07 yep
34:10 okay yeah let's wait for Alexa to return
34:45 yeah meanwhile I'm trying to find your
34:48 questions if you have some uh
34:51 but yeah it takes
34:54 time
34:56 hi uh
34:59 awesome uh the stream is still happening
35:03 good uh so I had to switch to my mobile
35:05 internet um something happened with my
35:07 home
35:09 internet um okay I do not remember the
35:13 question I asked so maybe you have some
35:16 memory of
35:18 it uh yeah you were asking about
35:21 teaching like um theory and practice
35:25 right yeah yeah yeah
35:28 you were actually talking about an
35:29 example of yours mhm yeah so I was uh I
35:33 remember studying so first I studied
35:36 theoretical machine learning and then I
35:38 attempted to do practical machine
35:39 learning on kago too and we were
35:42 learning like ban methods uh we were
35:45 learning support Vector machines and
35:47 none of these things were useful uh in
35:49 practice like when you actually do kugle
35:53 or when you work as a data scientist uh
35:55 we didn't learn we didn't study uh
35:58 gradient
35:59 boosting um like we didn't study many
36:02 things um and for you so for me it was
36:05 first uh Theory and then practice and
36:07 for you it was first practice and then
36:08 Theory so I'm wondering how it affected
36:11 the way you approach Theory and the way
36:13 you teach uh the this theoretical
36:18 skills uh yeah it it really uh has an
36:22 impact because I I I still don't like a
36:24 lot of theory to be honest so I I really
36:28 uh believe in that that to to learn
36:31 something you need to see how you can
36:33 apply it so what is the eventual
36:36 application uh and because of that when
36:38 I teach uh first of all I don't teach uh
36:41 like classical machine learning classes
36:43 for example and I I don't know how to
36:46 actually uh be good at that so I teach
36:50 mostly something about industry like
36:52 production machine learning which is s
36:54 like similar to melops like how to use U
36:56 I don't know DVC mlflow F API Docker
37:00 kubernetes how to deploy your models how
37:02 to monitor them that kind of stuff and
37:06 when you teach this uh you can just
37:08 teach on examples you can show the tool
37:11 you can show the problem that you need
37:13 to solve with that too and then you can
37:15 show how you solve it and then give a
37:18 homework uh so that's really something
37:21 that uh from the different angle you
37:23 show some there is a problem let's
37:25 figure out how to solve it
37:29 mhm yeah that's uh like for me it's also
37:32 the best way to learn uh cuz I remember
37:35 like I think the example uh we used when
37:39 doing machine learning was like
37:41 something related to fish I don't know
37:43 for me it was not relatable at all and I
37:46 think if we just used even this Titanic
37:49 data set it would be way better like I
37:53 don't really like the Titanic data set
37:55 cuz it's kind of weird
37:57 right cuz you predict who would survive
37:59 and who would not like to me
38:02 yeah like it's a weird like it's a super
38:05 strange problem but like I don't know
38:08 like take any other
38:10 classic data set like Boston Housing
38:13 right then yeah it's it's very relatable
38:17 and uh one of the things you mentioned
38:19 um so you teach practical
38:21 things and Industry machine learning not
38:25 classical machine learning and then you
38:26 said Docker I'm a
38:27 flow uh DBC kubernetes so this is
38:32 definitely something or maybe not
38:34 definitely but I suspect this is not
38:37 something you picked up on kagle right
38:40 yeah um so you probably learned these
38:42 skills elsewhere so how did you actually
38:47 develop the skills uh and uh yeah like
38:51 for a person starting a career of kagle
38:54 like how do you actually go into this
38:56 direction of production in machine
38:57 learning and learning more about
39:00 mlops yeah it's it's actually I think
39:03 it's very interesting example I
39:06 mean if like how I moved away from kagle
39:10 so I moved to I I started my career like
39:14 industrial career in avito as a data
39:17 analyst so there uh I I still was
39:21 participating in kgle but I saw that you
39:24 cannot like make up for living by GLE
39:28 competition so I decided to start uh a
39:32 job in industry and at a vaita I
39:34 understood pretty quickly that my python
39:37 skills are lacking and my machine
39:39 learning theory understanding is lacking
39:41 it's how it's vice versa compared to
39:44 your example when you were working at
39:46 some like job as data scientist then you
39:48 come to Kel and then you see you can't
39:51 compete this was like vice versa exactly
39:54 and uh I understood that there is like a
39:57 lot on machine learning outside of kagle
39:59 so that was very interesting for me uh
40:02 so I decided to continue I started
40:06 position in Yandex go as a data
40:08 scientist there I learned a lot of about
40:11 like let's say statistics I a testing um
40:15 also I learned something about python as
40:17 well but there I understood that you
40:20 know when you work in a big company like
40:23 uh Yandex or Google or like meta uh your
40:27 always are like small part of this big
40:29 machine so there are a lot of people who
40:31 do this machine learning and the
40:33 pipeline is pretty big there are maybe
40:35 dozen of people who are involved in uh
40:37 rolling out some new model or maybe more
40:40 than a dozen and uh your skills are
40:42 pretty narrow and I wanted to learn
40:46 outside of this so I moved to mechanica
40:49 where uh I had to learn pyth like Docker
40:54 python packaging uh kubernetes fast API
40:58 and it was painful but it was really
41:01 interesting because yeah I understood
41:03 there that I'm kind of becoming a full
41:05 stack in the sense I can talk to
41:07 business I can understand their problem
41:09 then I can build a like solution uh then
41:12 I can put it in production I can conduct
41:14 AB testing I can measure results I can
41:16 report this results set up monitoring
41:18 and that was really fascinating because
41:20 you are not stay in one like simple I
41:23 don't know small task but you are owning
41:25 all of the pipeline
41:27 and uh that that was really cool and
41:31 then at well that's how my career
41:34 developed so some people you know take
41:38 one one I mean I I have good friends
41:40 like mesnik we were talking about here
41:43 right and he is like python developer
41:46 and machine learning he's a god of
41:48 python he can do like so so complex so
41:51 complicated things and he's like python
41:55 developer in machine learning for five
41:56 or six years maybe even more and he's
41:59 like really great at this and I isn't
42:01 that type of person I'm trying to pick
42:04 up like different challenges for myself
42:07 during my
42:10 career yeah that's
42:12 interesting well eventually you both you
42:16 and mikale um ended up doing similar
42:19 things you just started from different
42:21 positions I guess yeah exactly that's
42:25 interesting and speaking of teach so
42:27 teaching is a topic that is very um
42:31 close to me personally because I've been
42:34 doing um I've been teaching for I don't
42:37 know last four five years um so I'm
42:40 really curious so we talked about like
42:42 how you started your teaching uh Journey
42:45 which is a really interesting story um
42:48 but how do you approach teaching now so
42:51 you're working for
42:52 University with a practical and uh with
42:56 focus on prac ice and uh industry
42:59 orientation how do you approach uh
43:02 coming up with the curriculum with what
43:04 to include in the courses what to
43:08 teach um that's a really great question
43:12 and uh I think there are like different
43:14 ways uh of doing this but what I found
43:17 for myself is that I'm trying
43:19 to
43:21 um to come up with some problem that's
43:24 interesting for students to solve during
43:26 the class uh and then build curriculum
43:30 around
43:31 it so for example for like mops class or
43:35 production machine learning uh I like I
43:39 want students eventually what I want
43:41 them to do I want them to learn all of
43:44 these tools like again mlflow Docker
43:46 fast API grafana Prometheus whatever and
43:51 uh it's it's really can be boring if you
43:53 just give the tool and give the task so
43:55 I'm design in a competition I mean it's
43:59 it's again comp comp a competitive
44:02 background I
44:03 guess uh I'm I'm designing a problem for
44:06 the whole semester so they need to build
44:10 a classifier that can uh like given a
44:14 dialogue between two people uh the
44:16 classifier can tell who is the like bot
44:20 uh AI model whatever llm and who is the
44:24 real person and we
44:27 we like we are building a platform where
44:30 these classifiers can uh like get data
44:34 from and then we'll have like them
44:37 competing with each other and during
44:39 throughout the class uh like students
44:42 just uh build the same like build upon
44:45 what they did previously so they start
44:47 with some dummy classifier that just uh
44:51 gives a random
44:52 number random probability then they add
44:55 like they collect data they use label
44:58 Studio to label that data then they
45:00 train model the loog they experiment Cal
45:03 flow then they wrap it in fast API they
45:06 deploy a machine learning model and they
45:08 see metrics on the leaderboard technical
45:11 metrics not actually machine learning
45:13 metrics but like technical how well they
45:16 they classifier is it online like the
45:18 app time the speed of response uh stuff
45:21 like that and I think like this is a
45:25 really good approach just uh find out
45:28 something interesting for students and
45:30 build curriculum around
45:32 it so yeah if you allow me another
45:35 example we have another class
45:39 currently okay thank you so we have
45:42 another class like machine Learning
45:44 System design and uh it's kind of a
45:47 broad topic like what what you can teach
45:49 in machine Learning System design
45:51 practically how to how to approach any
45:53 problem in like business problem with
45:55 machine learning how to like do
45:57 everything build prototype uh conduct a
46:00 testing whatever and uh we are
46:02 suggesting students to find some idea
46:04 they can work at they want to work at
46:06 during the semester maybe they want to
46:08 build a AI startup maybe they want to
46:12 solve smaller problem and I think when
46:14 people select something they like they
46:17 are more like they tend to tend to this
46:21 to actually uh like this problem and
46:24 like spending time on it
46:30 yeah that's really interesting in this
46:31 in the second example uh sorry my
46:34 internet is not really good that's why
46:36 there's a bit of L between yeah yeah
46:39 but there's a bit of lck so uh for the
46:43 second uh problem um when uh you
46:46 encourage students to select the problem
46:48 to solve
46:50 themselves do they form teams or they
46:52 work individually how yeah yeah they
46:55 form teams yep because
46:57 well yeah we also want to teach them
47:01 let's say working with G for example we
47:04 still want them to build
47:05 prototype and we also want to learn them
47:09 how to communicate between themselves
47:11 because it's really part of your of your
47:16 job that's amazing and um in the in the
47:20 first problem you said you want to make
47:22 it competitive so you design a
47:24 competition I understood the problem
47:27 that um okay they need to eventually
47:29 build a platform for classifying who is
47:31 bought who is a real person and then you
47:34 iteratively progress from adamic
47:36 classifier to like a full platform with
47:38 metrix and whatnot but where is the
47:41 competitive aspect yeah yeah I think um
47:45 I wasn't clear enough so what they built
47:48 they built a classifier which uh like is
47:52 just let's say fast pay service which
47:55 can uh receive requests
47:57 and then they plug it in into the
48:00 platform we are building outside of the
48:02 class so we have some uh like extra
48:06 project in University we're building
48:08 this platform and student just deploys a
48:10 classifier and on the platform when you
48:13 like different students attach different
48:15 classifiers they will be able to see
48:17 some metrics right
48:20 uh so it's really something okay similar
48:23 I guess it's a bit similar to production
48:25 so you can like SML like engineer
48:28 whatever whoever you just build
48:30 something you can add I don't know
48:32 monitoring to it you can add retraining
48:34 you can add cicd like uh whatever and
48:38 then there is some system that consume
48:40 your predictions that gives you data
48:42 consume your predictions and you need to
48:44 make your like your classifier work with
48:46 it pretty
48:49 well yeah that's interesting and then do
48:52 you have some sort of
48:54 leaderboard yeah yeah it's there are
48:56 like two types of leer board in this
48:59 there is ml metrix leader board like
49:02 which classifier is like smarter at the
49:04 detecting Bots and there is a second
49:06 leader board like technical leader board
49:08 with up times uh like uh times of
49:11 responses error codes and stuff like
49:14 that and on this class I want to focus
49:16 on the technical leer board because I
49:18 don't want like actually kle competition
49:21 there I want for students to try to
49:24 build the most reliable solution
49:30 this is an amazing idea maybe we should
49:32 also try to do something like that in
49:34 our classes uh but I I'm wondering so
49:37 for you and the so these are Master
49:40 students right so your classes are not
49:43 large yeah yeah yeah they are not large
49:46 like currently the university isn't big
49:48 we have like around 200 uh students uh
49:52 in master's degree but they are like in
49:55 different uh Direction like in machine
49:57 learning we have around one 100 maybe a
50:02 little more ah 150 students and so on
50:05 the
50:06 class there will be like 80 students or
50:09 something so a lot not but not this is
50:13 still a lot yeah so it's a significant
50:17 number compared to like I don't know
50:19 usual classes at least the one I had but
50:24 uh it's not like the same cuz you also
50:26 have experi in teaching uh in uh online
50:29 courses right
50:31 yeah right on course this is where the
50:33 number of 100 okay yeah like you you in
50:38 your bio it says 100,000 which is
50:41 obviously not University it's corera was
50:44 it corera yeah yeah yeah yeah it's
50:45 corera actually so I think it's uh and
50:49 corera is totally different format you
50:51 just build a class uh you just publish
50:53 it you design like some automatic
50:56 procedures to check Solutions and then
50:58 you have some people on the platform who
51:01 answer questions and maybe you some
51:03 sometimes answer questions but when
51:05 there are like uh so many students it's
51:08 hard to to do something I mean uh
51:15 otherwise and uh was it a class on how
51:18 to win kagle how to win M competition
51:21 something like
51:24 that I think I remember uh this class uh
51:28 this this course I didn't take it I
51:31 remember that you were doing it yeah
51:34 that's amazing great work thank you okay
51:38 uh and I I really like the idea of um
51:42 you know building a platform and then
51:44 letting students take like plug in their
51:47 ml models and uh since we're doing
51:50 online courses maybe it's not as simple
51:52 to implement this this cuz you have more
51:55 like closed environment with students so
51:57 you kind of know the the amount the the
52:00 number of
52:01 students but maybe this is something we
52:03 can uh borrow to in some of our classes
52:06 that that's really
52:08 interesting yeah maybe maybe you want to
52:11 to use this platform we can discuss it
52:14 as well because ah is it is it is it
52:16 open source uh it it isn't open source
52:19 but I think will host it like so anyone
52:22 can can use it in in this way but it's
52:25 uh because I I want to like we actually
52:28 want to reuse it in some other classes
52:30 outside of the University both in Moscow
52:33 and in Europe so maybe it will be
52:37 like good good option to to try it
52:43 maybe yeah let's talk uh do you actually
52:46 take part in developing this platform as
52:49 a developer uh
52:51 no rather
52:54 than the one yeah who asked to develop
52:57 it
52:59 actually yeah but but yeah I'm I'm still
53:02 closely connected to yeah
53:09 this are students developing it or it's
53:12 like professional software Engineers the
53:15 students it's just like u in the
53:17 University we have an idea that students
53:20 before they find a job they can test
53:23 their skills and get like close to job
53:26 experience at some projects at
53:28 University and some projects are from
53:31 external like companies and some
53:33 projects are from internal uh people and
53:36 this is this kind of project we actually
53:39 have three students developing it uh and
53:42 they're really great I mean they are
53:45 like junior or middle level so I was I
53:49 was happy to I was lucky to find
53:55 them do you I'm just curious how it's
53:58 organized cuz uh students they are not
54:01 experienced so they need
54:03 mentors uh and also students maybe do it
54:06 for half a year but then um I don't know
54:09 they graduate or they finish the class
54:11 or whatever so then there is another
54:13 student who spends again like I don't
54:16 know another half a year uh so this work
54:20 needs to be organized in such a way that
54:22 uh new people can come old people leave
54:26 uh but the process is still ongoing and
54:28 then there is somebody who can mentor
54:29 all the students right yep yep that's
54:33 true you get somebody from the industry
54:35 to Mentor or yeah yeah we for for each
54:39 project we have uh a mentor and in this
54:42 case we have a mentor from uh like tbank
54:46 which is kind tin of company and uh he's
54:50 also like spending a lot of time with
54:52 students he's reviewing his PO their
54:54 poll requests he's helping them to fight
54:57 some challenges there and regarding like
55:01 uh if some of the students want to move
55:03 out from this projects and we want to
55:05 find another one we're trying to kind of
55:08 again as with any software project we
55:11 try to document things um
55:15 like make code like look easy enough to
55:19 understand and stuff but uh we're only
55:22 doing this projects for like three
55:24 months uh I think
55:27 and we are launching it like launching
55:29 it one week later I mean in the end of
55:32 January we actually have uh like five
55:35 days haathon for master students at
55:38 University where they'll try to build
55:41 the best machine learning solution if on
55:43 the like mops class we want them to
55:46 build the best technical solution here
55:48 it will be the best model and we'll test
55:50 the platform and uh I think it will well
55:55 we maybe
55:57 we'll have uh to maybe some of the
56:00 students will go out of the project in
56:02 few months but then we'll we'll solve
56:04 this
56:07 somehow yeah that's pretty interesting
56:10 thanks there are a few questions uh do
56:13 you have uh maybe I see that we should
56:15 be wrapping up soon do you have like
56:16 maybe five more minutes yes of course
56:19 okay okay because there are um there are
56:23 a few questions that perhaps we should
56:24 address so one of them is uh pretty
56:28 interesting uh what is the best way to
56:31 convince your managers about the value
56:33 of kagle and ml
56:35 competitions yeah that's a tricky
56:38 question
56:40 um I think uh I think things like that
56:45 they are easiest
56:47 to to to go with by using some example
56:50 maybe you can find someone uh like in in
56:55 in your compy company who sold kaggle
56:57 and who is pretty good and uh show this
57:01 as an example maybe you have someone at
57:03 industry who's well known for your
57:06 company or your
57:07 managers uh maybe some advisor uh who
57:10 Sol kle competition maybe you can use
57:13 that as an example otherwise um I saw I
57:18 mean also it's important to understand
57:21 what what the value you're trying to get
57:23 out of this right if the value is just
57:26 to for example to introduce kagle as a
57:29 side activity to your company I've seen
57:33 these examples and it's usually um well
57:37 you can just show that other data
57:40 scientists are interested in solving kle
57:41 competitions on some like uh basis like
57:45 I don't know kle Club at the company and
57:49 uh sometimes there is a green light for
57:51 these initiatives so
57:54 yeah MH
57:56 so basically show them a good example
58:00 right yeah I think I think that's it I
58:03 don't I don't have a better answer to be
58:04 honest yeah that's a good answer uh
58:07 another question uh is there any secret
58:10 trick that works uh almost always in
58:15 competitions yeah that's that's also a
58:18 great question
58:19 because um you know the competitions are
58:22 unique I mean in the sense that we are
58:26 talking about winning competition right
58:28 and if you take a look at the top
58:30 Solutions on the leader board they
58:32 usually unique in some sense and they
58:35 they really heavily depend on the data
58:37 on the problem on the information
58:39 organizers gave you so it's really hard
58:41 to come up with a single
58:44 trick um really but what I what I what I
58:48 can say is that there are some things
58:51 that almost all of competition winners
58:54 do they explore data they do that
58:57 carefully they try to do Eda they try to
59:00 understand the domain and uh build a
59:03 careful validation let's say all all the
59:06 usual things but when you put this
59:08 together and do very carefully it
59:13 works yeah right so the secret trick is
59:17 just be careful and the time right yeah
59:21 yeah invest time that's that's really
59:23 important yeah
59:26 okay and uh what is your opinion about
59:28 generative AI like how does it affect uh
59:32 competitive machine learning like do you
59:34 see that people use it more often less
59:38 often um that's that's a really good
59:41 question I mean uh if we are talking
59:43 about I don't know chpt or like kilot
59:48 csor I think people use it but uh it's
59:53 not um it give you some H maybe to to
59:55 your product activity but it
59:58 really it really can't win competitions
1:00:01 I mean in after ml sense let's say um
1:00:07 but I see it's really useful I mean for
1:00:09 example myself when I solve some problem
1:00:12 I don't know with scut Boost for example
1:00:14 I just copy paste the the error lock and
1:00:17 put it to chpt and it it helps me
1:00:20 sometime to to fix the problem so in
1:00:22 this sense it's
1:00:24 useful MH
1:00:27 okay um I remember so back in the day
1:00:30 when I was taking part there were people
1:00:32 who were doing these outl Solutions um I
1:00:35 think one of them was kazanova maybe you
1:00:37 remember this guy yeah yeah so he wrote
1:00:39 some weird Java code that would just
1:00:42 take a problem and then train like a lot
1:00:44 of classifiers and then do emble on top
1:00:46 of that and that that gave a good basine
1:00:50 and then eventually he would just
1:00:51 improve this and he this way he won like
1:00:53 a lot of competitions or at least he he
1:00:55 got a gold medal in many competitions do
1:00:58 you think this approach uh still works
1:01:01 these days yeah it still works actually
1:01:04 just recently I was talking to Alexander
1:01:06 rashkov who is like I think now he's uh
1:01:10 grandmas in every category on kegal like
1:01:13 in competitions discussions kernels what
1:01:16 is the last category and he devop yeah
1:01:21 data sets thank you and he develops
1:01:23 optimal solution like Lama
1:01:26 after well and he told me that it really
1:01:30 gives you good Baseline you just put it
1:01:32 you get a baseline then you improve and
1:01:34 then you can win so it's uh it works but
1:01:37 it it cannot deliver you winning
1:01:39 solution
1:01:40 alone MH okay so it's just like before
1:01:44 maybe it was some obscure Java code that
1:01:46 somebody developed and didn't want to
1:01:48 share with anyone but now these days
1:01:50 it's CU we have access to this this AI
1:01:53 Solutions or LS these two become more
1:01:57 mature and also more complex right yeah
1:02:00 and open source some of them and open
1:02:03 source yes yeah lightl is open source so
1:02:07 that's that's that's pretty cool
1:02:10 actually what's your current keggle
1:02:13 rank I don't know it's it's
1:02:18 bad I just checked mine it's
1:02:23 9,575 so your probably better yeah but
1:02:26 but not not not a lot I
1:02:29 think they have only one gold medal and
1:02:33 you have like I don't know 10 or how
1:02:35 many around that don't remember around
1:02:38 that okay yeah yeah but it it doesn't
1:02:41 matter anything now I mean it doesn't
1:02:44 mean anything
1:02:47 now people still recognize you know yeah
1:02:50 yeah I mean it it was really useful in
1:02:52 this sense so and I was really lucky to
1:02:56 to start competing on Kangle and I think
1:02:59 it's you see even today's uh today's
1:03:02 interview it's happening like the title
1:03:04 is I don't know competitive data science
1:03:06 although I'm ma engineer now for five
1:03:09 years or
1:03:10 so still talking about
1:03:14 this and you don't actively compete now
1:03:16 do you uh nope nope nope I I'm teaching
1:03:22 some of the things I still find valuable
1:03:25 uh to to students but I don't compete
1:03:28 actually I have you know maybe you know
1:03:30 this guy there was I maybe no not there
1:03:33 was one uh person uh from our like
1:03:37 community at the time Serge AR he was
1:03:40 actually from s petburg but what's
1:03:44 amazing about him he's still competing
1:03:46 and like eight years p and he's still
1:03:49 competing and he this is his only
1:03:51 occupation and he makes enough money to
1:03:54 to live
1:03:56 and I find this amazing he wins money
1:04:00 enough money to actually leave off the
1:04:05 prizes yeah yeah yeah he does and uh I
1:04:09 found yeah and I was like I teach um
1:04:14 Kegel I mean some something about Kegel
1:04:17 for my students at University and I was
1:04:19 trying to find a person who actively
1:04:22 participates and who can teach not just
1:04:25 outdated thinks about something really
1:04:28 uh like current and I found him and he's
1:04:32 really great he's win competitions in
1:04:34 Kel and uh like here in Russia the like
1:04:38 the compe competitive level is lower
1:04:41 then in kago so he makes up for the
1:04:46 living yeah I checked the current uh
1:04:49 leaderboard and I recognize only one
1:04:53 person out of I don't know top
1:04:56 25 that I checked so everyone is
1:04:59 different now yeah yeah okay Alexander
1:05:03 it was uh really great to have you here
1:05:07 to talk with you to ask you questions
1:05:10 and get your perspective on things so
1:05:12 thanks a lot for finding time and
1:05:14 joining us today and also thanks
1:05:16 everyone for joining us today asking
1:05:18 questions being active so yeah it was
1:05:20 amazing thank you yeah thank you Alexi
1:05:23 thank you
1:05:24 everyone bye and sorry for the
1:05:26 connection problems uh yeah have a great
1:05:29 week
