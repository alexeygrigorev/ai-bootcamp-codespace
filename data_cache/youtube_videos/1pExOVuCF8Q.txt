1:33 though but I still need to that's
1:36 fine okay so we start right yep okay
1:41 this week we'll talk about collaborative
1:42 data science in business and we have a
1:45 special guest today yanes yanes is a
1:47 lead data scientist at EasyJet maybe
1:50 you've heard this about this Airline I
1:52 for sure did because I used it a couple
1:54 of times so in his role he works at
1:57 creating data products and solving
1:59 business business problems and he's also
2:02 leading the easy Jets mlops
2:04 team and yanes is also one of the
2:07 gradates of our ml Ops Zoom camp and I
2:11 was actually quite surprised that uh he
2:14 actually to took it with his experience
2:16 uh he should be should have been one of
2:18 the instructors actually but I'm very
2:21 happy that yanis did take the course
2:24 because of other otherwise we wouldn't
2:26 be talking right now so yeah welcome
2:30 yeah thanks for having me and for the
2:31 introduction it's been a
2:33 pleasure so before we go into our main
2:36 topic
2:37 of business and data science let's start
2:41 with your background can you tell us
2:42 about your career Journey so far yeah
2:45 absolutely um so education wise I have a
2:49 bachelor in mathematics and a
2:51 postgraduate uh in data science uh from
2:55 the Essex University um it's been fun
2:58 because I wasn't always planning to uh
3:01 to become a data scientist uh
3:03 essentially I'm I'm I'm Greek and this
3:05 is important because in in Greece
3:07 usually when you have a bachelor in
3:09 mathematics there are not many things
3:10 that you can do with uh this degree uh
3:13 you either become a a teacher uh which
3:16 is although exciting it wasn't something
3:17 that I wanted to uh to pursue or find a
3:20 way to mix it with um some other thing
3:23 so I was after I finished my bachelor I
3:25 was thinking about uh Financial
3:27 mathematics acarial mathematics
3:30 I didn't know what uh what to do and
3:33 luckily I got introduced to the notion
3:35 of data science by watching Netflix
3:38 actually the the famous Sherlock series
3:41 and there was a moment where it was
3:42 Sherlock and um John Watson and joh
3:46 Waton was impressed by C's decision
3:49 making skills so I remember he asked him
3:51 how do you make decisions that fast and
3:53 so accurately and C replied um you see
3:57 but you do not observe so that was Jones
4:00 problem and that really sit well with me
4:02 and I was thinking I want to improve my
4:04 decision- making skills and this is how
4:06 I started Googling around decision
4:08 making uh INF and all this kind of stuff
4:11 and I came across data science as a
4:12 profession uh back then that was in 200
4:16 uh 16 I think yeah so yeah um I did the
4:20 Masters in data science from the Essex
4:22 University followed by uh a three-month
4:24 internship where I was able to develop a
4:26 machine learning model uh to predict
4:28 children that are being abused in their
4:30 parental environment and that was great
4:33 because it showed me the power that uh
4:36 lies behind uh data science and machine
4:38 learning in general so I knew that this
4:41 is what I wanted to do so after the
4:43 intership I had a four Monon experience
4:45 working as a data scientist uh
4:47 consultant uh at um company named AA
4:50 Technologies in Geneva Switzerland and
4:53 after four months I was uh I decided to
4:56 move back to the UK where I started
4:58 working as a data scientist
5:00 uh for EasyJet where I'm still uh
5:02 working so yeah I started as a graduate
5:06 data scientist got promoted to senior
5:08 data scientist and right now I'm still
5:11 uh a lead data scientist um working with
5:14 the business stakeholders and try to
5:15 transform uh egyp to become the world's
5:17 most data driven Airline so yeah that's
5:20 pretty much me do you get a discount is
5:23 CH if you want to travel somewhere I
5:26 think that's one of the of the best
5:27 perks that we have and uh yeah the
5:30 that we do and it's an excellent
5:32 discount um I use it all the time to
5:35 travel and you know travel to different
5:37 European uh cities it's been
5:39 great was easy jet is uh like when it
5:43 comes to Berlin I don't know about other
5:44 cities and I'm based in Berlin uh like
5:48 it's one of the airlines I usually use
5:51 when I want to go somewhere I'm happy to
5:54 hear that we're doing something good
5:55 then well in terms of coverage yeah it's
5:59 probably one of the of the wor ones
6:02 least like I don't know going to Italy
6:03 or some other
6:06 countries okay funny that you funny that
6:09 you mentioned the Sherlock TV show um
6:14 have you seen there's a different
6:15 another a different TV show it's an
6:18 American one called numbers have you
6:21 seen that one oh that's interesting not
6:23 really not it's about a mathematician
6:27 who uses his the skills to solve crimes
6:33 so they're using statistics and like
6:36 data science well I wouldn't call it
6:39 data science in the sense you and I um
6:43 yeah mean it but still it's quite it's
6:46 quite close I'm always excited to hear
6:49 these use cases where data science is
6:51 being used for uh for good like the the
6:55 project that you just mentioned solve
6:56 crimes or the internship that they did I
6:59 think it's it's great to show how data
7:01 science can can can serve uh the people
7:03 and not you know be present to replace
7:05 people jobs or some of the things that
7:07 you hear from time to
7:10 time yeah so it's called numbers and I
7:13 think the E there is spelled like with
7:17 three so it's like number there I think
7:20 it rings a bell
7:22 yeah anyways uh what do you do as a lead
7:26 data
7:27 scientist so yeah uh currently my my
7:30 role as a lead data scientist is I
7:32 partner up with the business
7:33 stakeholders uh from Digital customer
7:35 and marketing these are the Departments
7:37 that I oversee from the data science and
7:39 analytics uh perspective and I try to uh
7:44 understand their pain points and
7:45 translate them into uh data products and
7:48 Data Solutions that go into production
7:50 and sell um solve whatever problem we
7:53 encounter uh at the time so you can
7:56 think of my role as having the
7:58 accountability of the the projects to
7:59 ensure that they uh reach production and
8:01 of course we meet the financial benefits
8:04 that have been agreed uh at the
8:05 beginning of every Financial
8:08 year in practice um what does it mean
8:11 when you say that you partner with
8:14 business stakeholders from like this
8:16 digital marketing how does it look like
8:18 in practice is it like you proactively
8:20 reaching out to them saying hey can we
8:24 talk or they reach out to you or it's a
8:27 combinational both like how how does
8:28 this collaboration look in your
8:32 case it's um it's a great question so
8:35 usually uh one of the things that I love
8:37 about ISJ is that it's a really friendly
8:39 environment so you can think of it as me
8:41 uh having uh close collaboration in
8:44 terms of meetings uh sitting with them
8:46 during um the business days and try to
8:49 understand what are the decisions that
8:51 they have to take on a on on a daily
8:53 basis and try to understand from from
8:55 their perspective what their strategies
8:58 what their vision is for for uh their
9:00 their department and understand how data
9:02 science uh can support into reaching the
9:05 their uh Vision so this is how it looks
9:08 uh on a day-to-day basis meetings and um
9:11 meetups Etc so they have like their
9:14 usual day-to-day meetings and you are
9:17 like hey can I join you just want to
9:19 observe what you do it's uh kind of yes
9:23 it's a we have a recurring meeting where
9:24 we discuss about uh what they're doing
9:27 uh brainstorming together we have um
9:30 let's call it a framework where we um
9:33 discuss about uh their day-to-day job
9:36 and what they're trying to improve and
9:37 see how I can support them with uh data
9:40 science okay so you have like a monthly
9:43 or something like that meeting that is
9:45 the current even more frequent actually
9:47 weekly more frequent weekly okay and
9:51 then there are
9:53 some leaders from these departments and
9:57 you talk to them saying hey what's up um
10:01 like how what are the current problems
10:03 you have how is it going with like the
10:05 previous projects we implemented for you
10:07 and things
10:08 absolutely the way I frame it is I think
10:11 of the head of the different departments
10:13 uh from Digital customer marketing as
10:15 being my best friend uh in the working
10:17 environment and try to understand how I
10:19 can be supportive and how I can help
10:23 them so how can you be
10:26 supportive
10:28 exactly
10:29 [Music]
10:30 how how does it look
10:32 like it's um so usually um it involves
10:36 of me getting enough business knowledge
10:38 so if you talk about digital uh it
10:40 involves of uh me understanding how the
10:43 let's say the uh PPC advertisements work
10:46 or SEO the organic results work and try
10:49 to understand what their uh aim is how
10:52 which are the metrics that they're
10:53 interested in and what do they do on on
10:57 on a day-to-day basis and see you know
10:59 know what if we had a predictive model
11:00 that could do X Y and Z would that
11:03 benefit you and then have this kind of
11:05 discussion that would
11:07 essentially get create some clarity on
11:09 the business problem that we will then
11:11 try to
11:14 tackle I heard this word digital digital
11:18 Department many times but I to be honest
11:21 I have no idea what it actually means
11:22 and probably it means different things
11:24 at different companies right because
11:26 like different companies need to do
11:29 different things so in your case uh you
11:32 mention like PPC at I don't know what
11:34 PPC is like paper click
11:37 right exactly it's click so it's also
11:41 some marketing stuff case of digital
11:44 exactly so payer click if you think of
11:46 that these are the sponsor ads that you
11:48 see on Google so if you go on Google and
11:51 you uh type flights from let's say l
11:53 London gwick to Berlin and you press
11:56 enter you see the 10 uh results that
11:59 appear on the first page of uh Google
12:01 and what you can see the first one are
12:02 usually the sponsor ads and uh these are
12:06 the the paper click ads as we um as
12:10 these are known and the reason they're
12:11 called paper click is because there is
12:13 an Inc care cost every time a person
12:15 clicks on that specific ad so we're
12:17 trying to in a way optimize which um
12:21 sponsored ads should appear on top and
12:23 we do the same thing for uh SEO results
12:25 which are the organic uh URLs that
12:28 appear which are usually below the um
12:31 sponsor ads it's it's a way in a way um
12:35 an optimization that we're trying to do
12:37 uh so that the flights that we want to
12:40 promote are always appearing on top and
12:42 then uh hence we can improve the
12:44 conversion
12:46 rate I was uh checking the other day the
12:49 cost per click in Google for words like
12:53 uh for keywords like mlops or mlops
12:56 courses yeah and it's starts like at the
13:00 sometimes it's for more Niche words it's
13:03 like three uh Euros per click and then
13:06 for more broad it's like four or even
13:09 five which was like wow is it that
13:12 expensive yeah yeah you you have to beat
13:15 on the right keywords and then you know
13:17 become relevant and all this kind of
13:19 stuff that are happening in Google
13:20 behind the
13:21 curtains for you as a lead data
13:24 scientist you need to figure out what
13:26 these people talk about like what does
13:28 PPC
13:29 uh like what they care about what is
13:32 optimization right and then with this
13:34 knowledge that you kind I don't know if
13:37 I can say extract from them learn from
13:39 them you then go and share this
13:41 knowledge with the data science team and
13:44 you say okay these are the problems that
13:47 uh these Department struggle with let's
13:49 think how we can help them right and
13:51 then you translate absolutely problems
13:53 into like the language of data science
13:55 and then together with the team you work
13:57 on solving this right exactly y
14:01 absolutely in addition to communicating
14:03 with stakeholders um I think you
14:06 mentioned other things like you make
14:09 sure that projects reach production so
14:13 what does it mean for you like first
14:15 okay you talked with the stakeholders
14:17 you understood that these are the pain
14:19 points they have uh what happens next
14:22 what what do you to next yeah data
14:24 scientist so um as soon as I had
14:29 um the problem statement defined we have
14:32 an operating model within EET that
14:35 really helps us understand uh first of
14:37 all what are the different steps that we
14:39 have to take to ensure that this the
14:41 solution of the problem will reach
14:44 production and then we make sure that we
14:46 adhere all to all these different uh
14:49 steps so there's a sequence that we
14:51 follow and as a l as a lead data
14:53 scientist I am accountable to ensure
14:55 that all of these processes are being uh
14:58 followed so we make sure that when the
15:00 pro uh when the data product reaches
15:02 production it will have the impact uh
15:05 that was uh expected and yeah that's uh
15:09 that's pretty much it in terms of my
15:11 role I can talk a little bit more about
15:14 the framework uh if you want me to uh in
15:16 case you it's quite interesting like
15:19 what are this steps and what is this
15:21 operating
15:22 model yes the the operating model that
15:25 we have uh I think it's one of the best
15:26 things that that we have created in EAS
15:28 and I had a speech about it at the mlop
15:31 summit so uh the operating model uh
15:34 consists of different uh stages I think
15:36 it's uh four phases if you will uh that
15:40 highlights all the different steps that
15:42 we need to take to ensure that the model
15:43 will will reach production so the first
15:46 thing is uh de Clarity on on the problem
15:49 statement and this is pretty much my
15:51 role this is the we like to call it the
15:53 single front door where we take a
15:55 business problem or an idea into the
15:58 into the funnel as soon as we do this uh
16:01 we have a Trias where all the the
16:03 relevant stakeholders uh come together
16:05 and we discuss a little bit more about
16:07 the idea you would expect people as um
16:10 business analysts attending um the
16:13 finance team uh to understand about the
16:15 financial benefits that uh might be
16:17 involved with the project uh lead data
16:19 scientist data Engineers every single
16:21 person that needs to be uh involved into
16:24 that specific uh project uh as soon as
16:27 we we do and we understand that you know
16:29 what there's a real possibility and
16:31 something good uh in this project and we
16:33 can uh take this on WE prioritize uh on
16:37 based on different ideas that have been
16:38 submitted over time and then we create
16:41 something like a priority that you know
16:43 what this problem is the most crucial
16:45 one so let's try to uh work on that
16:48 first um as soon as we have pick up a
16:51 project we create a so-called uh
16:52 definition of done which is at the
16:54 business understanding phase where we
16:56 try to understand a little bit more
16:58 about
16:59 uh which are the requirements that we
17:01 need to tick in order to make this
17:03 project a success which are the business
17:05 kpis that we need to influence uh
17:08 improve or um increase or decrease
17:11 depending and how we can measure the
17:14 benefits meaning that if I let's say
17:16 give you a random numbers as an outcome
17:19 how do you know that these random
17:21 numbers are good or not so we make sure
17:23 that we create a document the definition
17:25 of done uh document that highlights that
17:28 this is the data product this is what
17:30 production looks like and these are the
17:32 benefits that are going to be uh that
17:34 are going to come based on this
17:36 calculation methodology
17:38 [Music]
17:39 large not that large uh usually it's um
17:44 it's a single document we have a a
17:46 template so you can think about two to
17:48 three pages tops two to three okay yeah
17:51 it's it's not that much I think um but
17:55 it's a yeah it puts at a high level what
17:56 are the things that we need to make sure
17:58 to uh deliver at the end of the day so
18:01 we don't have really much of a moving
18:03 Target if you will so you have some sort
18:06 of a template right and then Google
18:09 Document or maybe a confence page and
18:12 then you just copy this page and then
18:14 you f in the The Things fill in the
18:16 information absolutely and you do this
18:20 um uh not me at this stage uh I oversee
18:24 the entire procedure but usually we have
18:26 a business analyst uh having workshops
18:29 with a business stakeholder who are
18:31 going to be the business accountable for
18:33 for the project and we try to capture
18:36 every single requirement uh to this
18:39 definition of done document so here name
18:42 there so here uh you don't talk about
18:48 machine learning yet more like about
18:50 okay this is the project and this is the
18:52 impact we expect this project to achieve
18:55 and this is how we measure this impact
18:57 and I think like that right so like you
19:00 don't talk about muching at all at this
19:02 stage right nothing at all it just
19:04 captures the definition of done captures
19:06 just the what of the product and not the
19:10 how yeah so no no discussing uh no
19:15 discussion of solution at all right so
19:18 just nothing
19:20 whatsoever
19:21 okay because at the end of the day we
19:24 may have a document and we may realize
19:26 down the line that it's not something
19:27 visible because we may know that what we
19:30 need to do and after we have all the
19:32 requirements we realize that you know
19:34 what the data is is not actually there
19:36 which means that this is a noo and when
19:38 when that happens although it doesn't
19:40 happen frequently this is a fail F
19:42 scenario and then we say you know what
19:44 we cannot proceed that let's take the
19:45 second in
19:47 line but this happens later right so at
19:50 the business understanding step
19:51 absolutely you come with this definition
19:53 of done uh document for a project which
19:55 is like two three pages long right and
19:57 then I guess you proceed to The Next
19:59 Step which is you mentioned checking
20:02 data in
20:04 exactly so so as everybody has signed
20:07 off this uh document uh the business
20:10 stakeholders uh data scientist which is
20:12 uh me in that case data Engineers uh
20:14 every single person involved then we
20:16 proceed to the next phase which is this
20:18 is where the data
20:20 signy um invol starts to to kick in yes
20:25 Inception you can think of it as the
20:28 edav exploratory data analysis where we
20:31 try to ensure that we have everything
20:32 that we need uh that includes uh access
20:35 to the data if the data is already
20:37 present any um gdpr concerns that we
20:40 might encounter
20:43 um explore the data sources as in
20:46 different distributions and this kind of
20:48 um concern that we might have uh so yeah
20:51 that's Prett much
20:53 it is this uh like at which stage do you
20:57 actually so you said this is when data
21:00 science kicks in is this at this stage
21:03 you think like do I even need machine
21:06 learing here or it's more like
21:07 analytical project absolutely uh okay so
21:12 as soon as we uh take off the Inception
21:14 phase this is where the data science and
21:17 the data scientists and analyst come
21:18 together and we brainstorm about the
21:21 solution so we discuss about the how and
21:24 at this point we understand whether this
21:25 is a a data science project that would
21:28 involve um that would involve machine
21:31 learning or a data analytics whether
21:33 it's uh it's a hybrid between that the
21:36 two different uh sub teams uh in the
21:38 data science and
21:40 analytics um to be honest we do have um
21:44 some let's say idea when the business
21:47 stakeholders discuss about the problem
21:50 and we may have already decided that
21:52 this point that this is a data science
21:53 project or data analytics but at the
21:55 assumtion we're absolutely certain that
21:57 you you know what this is 100% the data
22:00 science um project for instance it's
22:03 just a confirmation that we had when
22:06 when we
22:07 started and depending whether it is a
22:10 data science project or it is not I
22:12 guess the next step would be different
22:14 right absolutely
22:16 yeah it's data science project then you
22:20 say okay like I'm a data scientist I
22:22 cannot help you then somebody else takes
22:24 this over right um not really I'm the
22:28 accountable for both data science and
22:30 analytics project the only difference is
22:33 that if it's a it's an analytics project
22:36 the technical lead that will work that
22:38 will work on the project is going to be
22:41 um a data analyst instead of a data
22:43 scientist uh I still hold the
22:45 accountability of making sure that the
22:47 product is is delivered end to
22:49 end so what's the next step or is it
22:52 different different
22:54 projects uh not really uh as soon as you
22:57 have have an idea uh and you have
22:59 defined the how of um of solving the uh
23:03 the problem statement um this is where
23:05 we move into the uh research and
23:08 development phase this is the Hardcore
23:11 um modeling steps um in data science
23:15 where we follow all the different agile
23:17 methodologies uh spring planning
23:19 standups retrospective all The Usual
23:21 Suspects are usually uh there where we
23:24 start tackling all the different uh
23:26 stories that we have defined in a in a
23:29 cound board for instance um and we
23:32 Define Sprints this is the goal for
23:35 Sprint one Sprint to and uh yeah this is
23:38 where we start build building uh
23:40 whatever that that solution might uh
23:42 look like uh we also make sure that the
23:44 stakeholders are closely uh working with
23:47 us because you have to make sure that um
23:51 it's a it's a common problem that we're
23:54 trying to tackle and you want to make
23:55 sure that the business stakeholders are
23:57 part of the team and they're not just
23:59 sitting around waiting for uh a delivery
24:01 in 3 to six months time depending on the
24:04 the complexity so we make sure that we
24:05 tackle that as a single team so that's
24:08 why you have very regular weekly at
24:11 least weekly meetings with them right so
24:12 you want to keep them updated what is
24:14 the progress what is being solved right
24:16 now uh at what stage each of the
24:19 projects uh is right and things like
24:21 that absolutely and also at the end of
24:24 Every Spring which is usually um by we
24:29 um we have a demo where we show these
24:32 are the things that we have delivered
24:34 and if possible we have an actual demo
24:37 where we can they can get a sense of
24:39 what we're building and influence the
24:41 the some of the steps that we might take
24:43 on the on the future uh spring so they
24:46 have uh they they've over they oversee
24:50 the project from the beginning all the
24:52 way to the end so they make sure that
24:54 what gets delivered at the end of the
24:56 day it's something that they will will
24:58 end up using
24:59 mhm so I guess you also give them some
25:02 sort of demo like I don't know a stream
25:04 L up or something like this that they
25:06 can play with and they see okay like
25:09 this is not what I meant right or okay
25:13 yeah absolutely yeah uhuh and after the
25:18 R&D phase is there anything
25:21 else yes then we have the pilot phase uh
25:24 in the definition of done we have
25:26 already defined the kpis and the
25:27 Baseline that we're trying to beat uh
25:29 usually there's an exist an existing um
25:32 AIS process that we're trying to beat
25:34 with a with a new um solution and we
25:37 move into the pilot phase um where we
25:41 usually that looks like an AB testing
25:43 where we test the AIS uh process with a
25:46 2B process and uh ensure that the
25:49 product that we have built uh improves
25:52 the kpi of interest and we also collect
25:55 feedback during that time from the
25:56 business stakeholders because because
25:57 that can influence a second iteration of
25:59 the product if needed um so yeah after
26:03 the uh creation of the model uh usually
26:06 it's the pilot phase to ensure that we
26:07 get the benefits um that we were
26:10 expecting and if that sued then I guess
26:13 it's
26:14 deployment I'm just trying to come up
26:16 with a joke that it's like a pilot face
26:19 yeah I'm not
26:23 creative I know what
26:25 you so okay the steps are the phases are
26:29 that first it's the business
26:30 understanding phase when we come come up
26:33 with this definition of done for a
26:35 project then it's Inception phase where
26:39 people actually so in the first step you
26:42 talk about the what like not how the
26:46 second step is how you at the Second
26:49 Step you discuss the actual solution and
26:51 then you also decide if it's like a data
26:53 science project or more like analytical
26:55 project then during the R&D phase Cas
26:57 you work on the development research and
27:00 development of the the project right and
27:04 then you mentioned you also talked about
27:06 how exactly you do this like all this
27:08 agile agile uh techniques and then at
27:11 the end there is the pilot phase where
27:13 you take what you developed and then you
27:15 see if the kpi you defined in the
27:18 definition of done you can actually meet
27:20 them right absolutely yeah that's
27:24 correct so that's the four steps that
27:26 you mentioned he's is there a fifth one
27:28 like after the pilot like like
27:30 production of pilot uh it's usually the
27:32 production and as you probably already
27:35 know production is a spectrum so
27:37 production might mean um surfacing some
27:40 insights into um a table dbo for
27:44 instance it can be some predictions
27:46 being uh surfaced into an external Tool
27:49 uh that can be all all sorts of
27:51 different things so depending on what
27:52 this means uh we have the appropriate uh
27:55 let's say production framework uh which
27:58 is still being um developed at the
28:00 moment of course mlop journey is still
28:02 at the beginning um but yeah uh after we
28:05 see that the benefits are already there
28:07 and we bit the Baseline uh we roll this
28:10 out to the entire Market depending on
28:12 the project of course um and
28:16 yeah and mostly the use cases you deal
28:19 with they related to marketing and
28:22 similar cases like all these campaigns
28:26 yes most
28:27 digital and
28:29 marketing so you don't uh try to uh work
28:34 with I don't know the actual ples and
28:36 the
28:38 schedules uh not myself but that's
28:40 that's an excellent question because uh
28:42 as a lead data scientist I'm looking
28:43 after Digital customer marketing but we
28:45 have uh two uh three more actually uh
28:49 lead data scienes where every single one
28:51 is looking after uh a different let's
28:53 say division of the business so we have
28:56 uh we have a lead dat data scientist
28:57 who's who's looking after uh scheduling
29:00 a network another data lead data
29:02 scientist looking after the uh Ops
29:05 within n and of course pricing in
29:11 Revenue yeah I notice the tickets became
29:14 more
29:15 expensive after
29:17 Co I have no idea about about this no
29:20 comment you have discounts
29:23 right yeah I remember it was like um a
29:27 dip to Italy before Co costed like it
29:30 was sometimes it was actually more
29:33 expensive to get the bus that goes from
29:36 the airport to the city then like the
29:38 actual ticket but yeah these changes the
29:42 these days are gone now it's yeah gu
29:46 inflation as well and
29:49 yep yeah I was always wondering like how
29:52 companies like cire can keep their costs
29:54 that low like when it's like 10 for a
29:56 ticket
29:58 but yeah probably they cannot because
30:00 now it's different it's exactly I think
30:03 it's it's different business models that
30:05 uh different airlines operate and uh
30:08 there's a specific mindset that allows
30:10 let's say Riner to uh operate with tiets
30:13 that have t price compared to AJ or Wier
30:17 different competitors of
30:20 course yeah you talked quite uh you
30:24 already talked a little bit about agile
30:27 theologies that you use at during the
30:29 R&D phase and I was wondering maybe you
30:33 can talk more about this like how you
30:36 structure your day-to-day work when it
30:38 comes to working on data science
30:40 projects like in my experience I
30:43 remember it was some time ago and we
30:45 tried scrum so like maybe I'll take a
30:48 step back CU like my background was
30:50 originally a Java developer and scram
30:53 Works quite well for like well defined
30:56 develop like software engineering
30:58 projects right but when it comes to data
31:00 science it's a little bit more ambiguous
31:03 because like you don't know what you
31:06 will have at the end like the thing will
31:08 you will build will it work or not right
31:12 because in software engineering it's
31:13 usually more it's less undetermined
31:17 let's say usually you know that uh you
31:19 will eventually build the think that
31:21 solves the problem you just don't always
31:24 know how long it will take right uh but
31:27 yeah when it comes to data science you
31:29 not only don't know how long it will
31:30 take but you also don't know whether it
31:33 will actually work at the end right of
31:36 course how do you structure your
31:39 processes around this problem so you
31:42 mentioned a Sprint planning Canan I'm
31:45 curious to know like in more details
31:47 like how exactly you structure the
31:50 work yes uh absolutely so this is um of
31:55 course I was working as a technical lead
31:57 as a senior data scientist which means
31:58 that at the moment as a lead data
32:00 scientist um I don't let's say schedule
32:04 the all the ad uh ceremonies but as a as
32:07 a technical lead when I was a senior I
32:08 did have that experience so what I was
32:12 um what I was following is um all the
32:16 different agile methodologies that have
32:17 been introduced I was making sure to to
32:20 stick with them and I know what you what
32:24 you said about being uh ambiguous this
32:26 is actually true because in data science
32:28 you don't really know what you're
32:29 building until you go and actually build
32:32 it and this is when you realize whether
32:34 it's it's working or not um so what we
32:37 try to do to make the the process a
32:39 little bit simpler um to ensure that
32:43 it's working is we have the notion of
32:46 MVPs which is of course minimum uh
32:48 viable products which means that on the
32:51 definition of done document we have all
32:54 the list of requirements that we know we
32:56 have uh to build which means that we
32:59 kind of have a sense already of what
33:02 we're building and which is the
33:04 direction that we're uh taking and
33:07 because we know what we're building we
33:09 it's a little bit easier to estimate the
33:11 time that it might take for us to
33:13 deliver a single uh requirement or a
33:16 single uh
33:17 feature uh that doesn't mean that we're
33:19 always following a scram personally I'm
33:22 I'm an advocate of kamban because of the
33:24 complexities that have to do with uh
33:26 with uh the data science and machine
33:29 learning but usually we have to make
33:31 sure we we're a little bit good in
33:34 estimating that a specific feature is
33:36 going to take let's say one uh week and
33:39 a half so we even though we may not
33:42 follow strictly the scrum methodology we
33:45 actually have a Canan board and we try
33:48 to uh put some timelines into our
33:51 schedule to ensure that you know what we
33:53 will have something built by the end of
33:55 this uh two we spring
33:57 and of course we we make this with um
34:00 all the different agile ceremonies that
34:01 we mention so we have the the spring
34:03 planning ensuring that we have the
34:05 different complexities allocated to the
34:08 different stories of course there are
34:09 many ways to to do that uh but yeah at
34:12 the end of the day we do have some sense
34:14 of how much something is going to take
34:16 because of the notion of MVP and we try
34:19 to uh stick to this uh two week uh
34:23 Sprints
34:25 so have like all your work
34:30 is like you group all your work into
34:34 like these two week Sprints like at the
34:36 beginning of each Sprint you
34:38 do some sort of planning where you
34:41 decide okay for this two weeks for this
34:44 Sprint we take this this and this and it
34:47 will take like probably all two weeks
34:49 right and then during the weekending on
34:52 the resources mhm the resources is the
34:56 people who work on on this
34:57 right M something to add here that also
35:01 helps us estimate the different stories
35:03 and how much they're going to take uh
35:05 also comes at the Inception phase
35:07 because at the Inception phase we dive
35:10 into the data and try to understand a
35:11 little bit about the the quality um of
35:15 the data how much pre-processing we
35:17 might have to do uh or how much time a
35:19 specific implementation might take
35:21 depending on the complexity of the
35:22 project so the uh the Inception phase
35:25 also gives us a sense of um an
35:29 understanding of how much time this
35:31 specific implementation is going to take
35:34 but that helps us estimate a bit the
35:37 timings can you maybe walk us through
35:39 the entire Sprint so the Sprint starts
35:42 with planning and I think it ends with
35:43 demo what what happens in
35:46 between yes uh so in between uh we have
35:50 the daily stand-ups uh where of course
35:53 it's um it can be a written standup or
35:55 an actual 15 minute
35:57 uh standup where we go usually in the
35:59 morning where all the team comes
36:01 together and we say you know what I've
36:03 been working in uh this story this is
36:05 the progress I I made so far this is the
36:08 plan I'm going to work on uh today or
36:11 for the next couple of days and these
36:13 are any blockers that we have I'm
36:15 encountering at the moment uh usually
36:18 when this happens you have a senior
36:19 member um jump into support so we make
36:22 sure that all the bloggers are removed
36:24 so we can deliver um the project in time
36:28 or the feature uh in time um and of
36:32 course depending on the complexity of
36:33 the project that can be um let's say uh
36:35 an everyday standup or um every other
36:39 day uh really depends but I think what
36:41 works the best according to my
36:43 experience is having let's say two
36:45 standups uh per week so that it gives
36:48 time for the people to work on on the
36:50 different stories and of course if
36:52 something goes wrong you can always
36:53 reach out to a teammate to ask for
36:56 support
36:58 um so yeah that's pretty much it in
36:59 terms of standups and of course heavy
37:02 process right so what I understood is
37:04 like you have this uh estimate like the
37:09 start of the Sprint where you estimate
37:12 then you have daily or not daily like
37:14 some stand up meetings during the week
37:16 and then at the end you have the demo
37:18 right and that's basically the process
37:20 right so it's not very heavy you don't
37:22 have CU I know in scram like all sorts
37:24 of other things like I don't know grp
37:27 groming like I don't even remember what
37:29 else but I remember
37:33 thaty it can get quite heavy like if you
37:36 implement it to if you follow the book
37:38 and try to implement
37:40 everything no that's true uh but I think
37:43 the notion of uh agile is actually being
37:46 agile and see what works for your team
37:48 and what doesn't uh so we have tried
37:51 with different meetings according to
37:54 what has been proposed over time but we
37:56 have identified that this this framework
37:59 that we have works great for our team
38:01 and we uh we follow this specific uh
38:03 framework uh one of the things that Ben
38:06 Diaz which is the director of the data
38:07 science and analytics team says is we
38:09 have to uh be agile in being agile and
38:12 uh I think that summarize
38:15 everything how does uh estimating look
38:19 like for you do you use like planning
38:20 pocker or things like that
38:24 or uh it depends on so different teams
38:27 use different techniques we have um the
38:30 fer sizing sometimes we follow the
38:32 Fibonacci uh sequence to um allocate uh
38:36 points we also have scram master that
38:38 support us in in that way um we make
38:41 sure that we don't use days um as a way
38:44 of estimation so whatever has worked for
38:47 the different team members over time
38:49 it's um usually the technical uh lead of
38:52 the project decides which method they
38:53 want to
38:55 use
38:57 yeah yeah
38:58 interesting so you do some sort of
39:01 planning poet right or yeah
39:05 yeah and how how does it look like so
39:08 like the I imagine that there's a
39:10 meeting in this meeting you have
39:12 different uh people like you scram
39:16 Master Project Lead data scientist who
39:19 implement this yeah and somebody for
39:22 example you or the Project Lead says and
39:25 let's now talk about this task this
39:28 story that we are going to take in this
39:29 print which is about I don't know
39:32 changing the color or changing the chart
39:34 and this dashboard or whatever right and
39:37 then yeah whatever that might be
39:38 everyone says okay like I think this is
39:40 a very easy task right and then um
39:44 exactly and then you put the number on
39:46 top depending on which one do you think
39:47 is the most complex one you put the
39:50 numbers and yeah this is pretty much it
39:53 so every single team member of course
39:55 there are always outliers but usually
39:57 you have all all the different stories
39:58 and you say okay which one do we think
40:00 is the most complex one this gets
40:02 allocated to that specific number and
40:04 then we increase the complexity
40:05 depending on the methodology that we
40:09 use yeah interesting and in your
40:11 experience does it work
40:14 well uh I think so I think so uh at
40:17 least there has been examples where it
40:21 has worked uh perfectly and of course
40:23 there are always um the bad examples
40:26 where you can see that you're quite
40:28 tough uh when it comes to to timelines
40:31 but I think the bottom line is that you
40:33 have to adjust and
40:36 be be mindful of the fact that you uh
40:39 not everything uh is expected to go well
40:42 on every single project so as soon as
40:44 you manage your expectations I think
40:46 you're
40:48 good and when it comes to business
40:50 business stakeholders I expect I assume
40:53 you don't invite them to your standups
40:56 but you probably invite them to the
40:58 demos
40:59 right yes that's that's correct and I
41:03 think that's a great way to for the
41:05 business stakeholders to get a sense of
41:06 what we're building because they can get
41:08 an early interaction with the tool and
41:10 the uh the direction that we're taking
41:13 and they're also feel part of the team
41:16 and that makes them more engaged uh to
41:19 uh what we're building and you know
41:21 create this sense of we are a team and
41:23 we're trying to tackle this problem
41:25 together instead of us acting like
41:27 Consultants this is what we're building
41:29 for you just use
41:31 it I also imagine that um the business
41:35 stakeholders so it could be like head of
41:37 marketing or head of digital or some
41:39 other head they don't necessarily know
41:42 what it's like I don't know a curve
41:44 means and things like that or Precision
41:47 recall um yes when it comes to demos
41:51 that are maybe a little bit more
41:52 Technical and they they see and just
41:55 okay I don't understand but I trust you
41:58 that you do your work yeah right how do
42:02 you deal with uh this when like
42:05 stakeholders do not necessarily
42:07 understand what the team is talking
42:08 about or you maybe educate stakeholders
42:11 educate the team both or what
42:14 else so uh I think uh in cases like that
42:18 you really have to be a chameleon and
42:20 this is where soft skills H come into
42:22 place because we when we have um demo
42:25 session at the end of uh of every Sprint
42:29 we have to make sure that we we never
42:31 use technical language with them because
42:35 you have to adjust your contact for
42:37 non-technical uh audience so um I don't
42:40 think there's been a single project
42:42 let's say where we have um thrown some
42:46 let's say technical um technical jargo
42:50 if you will indicate the team members
42:54 that uh you you can say look if you say
42:58 RC curve they will like okay what is
43:00 that so you teach them how they present
43:05 they can present uh absolutely the
43:08 findings the projects the Demos in a way
43:11 that St holders will understand right
43:14 exactly uh we never use any technical uh
43:17 language with them and if if there's
43:19 something that you need to to explain uh
43:22 that might require uh some technical
43:24 knowledge we always make sure that we
43:26 use examples that are that can be can be
43:29 easily interpretable compared to um a
43:32 technical implementation that you have
43:34 seen so for instance if you think about
43:36 recommended systems and you want to
43:39 understand how a specific person is
43:41 closely related to to another you
43:44 wouldn't say you know what as as a
43:46 measure of understanding how close to
43:48 individuals are we use let's say thean
43:50 distance you actually put two examples
43:53 um where you say you see that this two
43:56 two people look similar and you don't
43:57 really need to Define similar uh in this
44:00 context because they can see that you
44:01 know what all the different rows for
44:03 instance look the same compared to to
44:05 another individual um that is let's say
44:08 completely uh on a different cluster so
44:11 when you want to explain this kind of
44:13 technical uh details you can always use
44:15 an example that would make sense for a
44:16 non-technical
44:18 audience well I assume that this is also
44:20 a skill presenting your findings in a
44:24 way that non-technical people think so
44:26 and this is uh it can be even more
44:29 difficult to learn the skill to master
44:32 the skill uh let's say even more
44:35 difficult than I don't know learning
44:36 machine learning at least for technical
44:38 potentially yes yeah who are used to
44:41 know I I don't know who are used to
44:43 Terminals and notebooks and I know all
44:47 this stuff
44:49 then going and presenting something to
44:52 business stakeholders might be not
44:54 something that they used to to uh doing
44:57 so how how you how do you educate people
45:00 like how do you uh help them learn the
45:06 skill or Master the
45:08 skill uh I don't think there's an easy
45:11 way I think this this comes with
45:13 experience and just making sure that you
45:14 always um enhance your uh soft skills
45:18 one of the things that uh usually helps
45:21 is if you think about all the different
45:24 um you know sentences that people use
45:26 say uh teach teach to me like I'm a
45:28 5year old or um I think Einstein has
45:32 said that if you can explain something
45:33 in simple terms you don't know it uh
45:36 that well uh so I guess it's just a
45:39 matter of reminding people that the
45:41 people that we have um on the other side
45:44 of the call they don't have the
45:46 technical uh experience that you have so
45:48 try to speak their language and uh
45:51 explain what you're doing like you're
45:53 spe speaking to uh some 5year old uh so
45:58 yeah I guess there's no there's no easy
46:01 way to do this just this comes with
46:02 experience and constant feedback of
46:06 course yeah and um I guess having a five
46:09 year old
46:13 helps I can only imagine yeah like maybe
46:17 if you don't have a kid who is five
46:19 years old you have no idea like how much
46:21 knowledge they actually have
46:24 yeah I I sometimes so I have a a son
46:27 he's seven years old and he sometimes
46:31 asks me things uh like I don't know how
46:34 GPS works right
46:37 idea of course let's say if I go on the
46:41 internet and uh type like how GPS works
46:44 and the explanation would be like super
46:46 technical then okay how do I explain
46:48 this thing so it's a skill well one hack
46:51 I found um quite useful is just asking
46:55 JP I guess everyone uses this now oh
46:58 yeah of course absolutely absolutely um
47:01 I still remember some of the days where
47:03 uh sgpt wasn't out I remember I was a
47:06 graduate data scientist at the time and
47:09 uh I got the opportunity to present
47:10 something to business stakeholder I
47:12 think uh this is when I found out uh not
47:15 in a nice way that my ways of presenting
47:18 and soft skills are not as good because
47:20 I remember it was really cringe moment
47:22 where trying to to explain why having H
47:26 99% accuracy as a as a wider term
47:29 doesn't mean anything unless you know
47:31 about the balance of the labels so yeah
47:34 I think it was it didn't go well so I
47:37 think this this pushed me a little bit
47:38 to try to understand how I can present
47:40 to someone that doesn't have the the
47:42 technical expertise I think it comes
47:44 with experience at the end of the
47:46 day and actually like we can think think
47:51 of ourselves as 5-year-old kids too when
47:53 it comes to learning new things cuz like
47:55 for example when I read this article
47:59 about how GPS works I am clueless like
48:02 okay like there's a bunch of terms that
48:04 try to explain me but like I don't
48:06 really understand what's happening there
48:07 so the explanation that CH GPT gave to
48:10 my son was actually helpful for me to
48:12 also understand that so I guess we can I
48:15 don't know if I should say that but
48:16 maybe we can think of stakeholders as
48:19 [Laughter]
48:21 KS yeah know I know what you mean um I'm
48:26 I'm really happy that all the
48:28 stakeholders that we have within is that
48:29 are really uh literate in terms of data
48:32 science mathematics it makes our work
48:34 really really uh easy so I'm so thankful
48:37 uh to
48:39 that yeah great so also I wanted to
48:42 spend a bit of time actually talking
48:44 about the mop Zoom Camp course because I
48:47 was yeah of course um I was really
48:50 surprised so when I looked at your
48:51 background I thought like why yanis even
48:54 considered
48:56 like because with your experience you
48:58 you're already doing like all the things
49:00 you talked about right now yeah I'm
49:03 wondering what inspired you to take our
49:06 course so why did you decide to take
49:09 it yeah absolutely um so the thing is as
49:14 as a lead data scientist uh my role has
49:16 become a little bit more uh managerial
49:18 compared to um you know the amount of
49:22 time that they have to spend doing
49:23 technical stuff and if you me having a a
49:27 bachelor in mathematics I'm I'm a Geck
49:29 at heart which means that every
49:30 opportunity that I get to get my hands
49:32 on dirty with some data and build
49:34 something myself I always take it and um
49:38 the mlop specifically is from my
49:41 experience I'm usually involved uh into
49:45 uh let's say building the models and I
49:48 don't get I didn't get at least much
49:51 exposure into the production
49:53 productionizing side of things and and I
49:56 don't know just I was in treed uh by by
50:00 the course the uh content um of course I
50:03 was using mlflow but then we had prefect
50:06 uh the data engineering team we have
50:07 using airflow so I'm like let me get
50:09 into that engineering side of things a
50:12 little bit uh more and also get the
50:14 opportunity to get my hands on dirty so
50:16 I think this is what clicked for me and
50:18 I'm like yeah let me go for
50:21 it well somebody who was Elite data
50:24 science scientists in the past like one
50:27 problem for me was always time like with
50:30 all
50:31 this stakeholder management like how do
50:34 I actually find time to still be hands
50:36 on and like experiment with things uh
50:39 and then sometimes like I wanted to take
50:42 a course but then I didn't have time
50:45 because like there's only 40 hours that
50:47 you spent at work how how do you did you
50:49 solve this problem for
50:51 you yeah that's that's a great question
50:55 uh I think one of the of the good things
50:57 about my decision to become a data
50:58 scientist is that I genuinely love the
51:02 profession so I would I would be a data
51:04 scientist as a hobby if my um day job
51:07 was something different which means that
51:09 even uh even when I finished job I don't
51:11 feel trained about all of the
51:13 information that uh I had to go through
51:16 throughout the day and I generally enjoy
51:20 uh working as as a data SCI which means
51:21 that I can I consider that as a as an
51:24 activity rather than as a let's say
51:27 something that will consume my time uh
51:30 so yeah it was just just great I had uh
51:32 my morning uh cup of coffee and during
51:34 the the weekends I was getting my laptop
51:36 go to to nice um coffee place and yeah
51:40 just uh watch your courses and try to do
51:42 the assignments it's it's been fun and I
51:45 got a lot of experience out of it to be
51:48 honest so yeah no it was just
51:51 great so instead of watching Netflix you
51:53 watched the the courses
51:57 what was that so instead of watching
51:59 Netflix you watch the courses
52:02 yes
52:03 yeah okay and uh well it sounded like
52:08 the course was useful for you right was
52:10 it mostly like this uh I don't know if I
52:13 should call
52:15 entertainment part or more like self
52:18 educated part or you also took something
52:21 out of this course and applied it at
52:23 work it was bit of of both so it was
52:27 entertainment in the sense that uh I got
52:29 confirmation that what I'm doing uh is
52:31 correct but also uh I got the
52:34 opportunity to play with technologies
52:36 that otherwise I wouldn't have uh time
52:38 to to do so one of the examples is uh
52:41 prefect uh for instance uh because as a
52:44 lead data scientist I'm not that
52:45 involved into the engineering side of
52:47 things so I wouldn't get the opportunity
52:51 to play with airflow or uh prefect so
52:55 yeah I think it had a good balance of of
52:58 both getting confirmation of what I'm
53:00 doing is correct but also get uh learn
53:02 something new and this is really
53:04 important because as you mentioned in
53:06 the beginning I'm I'm leading the mlops
53:08 team within EJ and even though I give
53:11 the guidance and the influence of where
53:14 we're going uh as as a data science and
53:17 analytics team with our mlop journey uh
53:19 it was great for me to understand a
53:21 little bit about the technical landscape
53:23 because I feel that that's the best way
53:25 you influence uh a specific Direction so
53:29 that that uh that really worked
53:31 well and actually before our uh
53:34 conversation before our interview I had
53:36 a chat with Elena from evidently and she
53:39 said oh oh that's nice you to your uh
53:43 podcast so make sure to ask about
53:47 evidently absolutely evidently I think
53:51 and I'm not afraid to say this but I
53:53 think evidently is the best python
53:56 Library there is out there for model
53:58 Monitor and this is something the the
54:01 final assignment that I did for um the
54:04 mlop zoom cup also gave me the
54:06 opportunity to play with the evidently
54:08 Library a little bit more because I had
54:11 the time to play with evidently even I
54:14 think three two years ago when it was
54:16 still at in a way Dev um version and I
54:20 remember this one the first time that I
54:22 reached out to them because I said you
54:24 know what I have implemented that and it
54:26 doesn't look correct and there was
54:28 actually a bug and this is how the uh
54:30 the networking uh kicked in uh but yeah
54:33 evidently absolutely uh the best python
54:37 library for model
54:39 monitor do you use it is it J
54:42 Too absolutely we uh we use it in the
54:45 sense of uh embedding that with uh
54:47 within our uh mlops framework it's still
54:50 work in progress uh but we have made uh
54:53 tremendous uh progress uh all these uh
54:56 years and I think especially now that
54:58 we're trying to define the our mlops
55:01 capabilities um evidently is is the best
55:05 thing that could uh happen to me and to
55:07 e to to that
55:09 extent just curious um like I know
55:13 evidently right now have their own
55:16 dashboard but probably what you do is
55:17 based on some sort of like other
55:20 monitoring framework like grafana or
55:22 something like that
55:23 right uh
55:25 yeah um I mean right now we're thinking
55:27 about using the tblo dashboard and I
55:29 have a proof of concept that I'm about
55:31 to to present uh to is to the mlop steam
55:35 uh but before that because I had already
55:38 implemented proof of concept we weren't
55:40 using uh grafana we didn't have a UI to
55:43 be honest uh I had implemented a custom
55:45 function that would uh trigger any mail
55:48 alert the technical lead of the project
55:50 in case there was uh data drift or model
55:52 drift uh detected so it was during where
55:57 I think two to three years
56:00 ago yeah you mentioned T and it's
56:03 interesting uh how how I say versatile
56:07 this tool is it's not just a dashboard
56:10 yeah can even build simple like
56:13 rudimentary monitoring in Tableau as I
56:16 remember uh we had problems with data
56:19 quality and then our analyst quickly
56:21 came up with a dashboard that shows how
56:23 many record there yeah each day in each
56:27 uh in the important tables and then what
56:30 he did next is configuring Tableau to
56:32 sent an alert if the number for one of
56:35 the days was less than expected that's
56:39 true and that's true he did that in like
56:41 30 minutes or something that was amazing
56:43 wow okay that's great indeed sounds
56:46 amazing goodness I mean at the end it's
56:48 just a bunch of SQL queries and then
56:50 knowing where to put these queries and
56:52 which button to click to create an alert
56:54 of course he knew how to do this uh not
56:57 everyone knows that but it was like
56:59 quick and dirty solution that worked
57:01 pretty well yeah it's amazing no that's
57:04 good it's it's always exciting when
57:06 someone delivers something that Fen at a
57:08 short period of
57:10 time yeah I think we're almost uh we
57:13 should be finishing soon
57:16 so well maybe I'll ask you that so we
57:19 talked a lot about communicating with
57:21 stakeholders with business stakeholders
57:23 we also talked about agile process proc
57:25 es we talked a little bit about
57:27 melops are there any good resources that
57:30 you can recommend to our listeners who
57:32 want to learn more about these
57:35 topics uh about which topic specifically
57:38 is is there well about any of those that
57:40 we discussed like let's say about uh
57:42 processes about communicating with
57:44 business
57:45 stakeholders um let's say probably when
57:49 you were learning like how to do your
57:51 job well maybe you came across some of
57:53 the books or courses that
57:56 you uh there is a single resource that I
58:00 would recommend to to every single
58:03 aspiring data scientist data analyst um
58:06 to watch out for uh I'm not sure if
58:08 you're uh if you know Cassi kikor uh
58:11 she's the decision intelligent Advocate
58:13 from Google at least at Google I think
58:15 she she resigned but uh Kazi kikor and
58:20 her uh course on YouTube uh making
58:23 friends with massine learning I think
58:25 it's the best resource there is out
58:28 there in order to understand how you can
58:30 communicate technical details to non
58:32 technical uh audience I think the way
58:35 she speaks and she uh expresses these
58:38 kind of technical details uh in a in
58:41 such a nice and direct way I think it's
58:44 one of the best skills that um someone
58:47 can get and I think watching your
58:49 YouTube videos it helped me really
58:52 understand what would be the best way to
58:54 explain it technical term to someone
58:55 that is not familiar with my world and
58:58 data science in general and I spent I
59:01 think countless uh hours watching her
59:04 videos try to analyze the way that he
59:06 that she approaches um things terms or
59:10 explaining how linear regression works
59:12 so if you want H Kasi Kor from uh
59:15 decision intelligence science from
59:17 Google uh Here YouTube uh video making
59:20 friends with machine learning at least
59:22 this is how to communicate to a
59:24 non-technical
59:26 audience um and when it comes to
59:28 technical details um I think different
59:32 books like uh pattern recognition from
59:35 uh Bishop it's one of the best books uh
59:38 that you can go it's really heavy so you
59:40 have to make sure that you're
59:41 comfortable with mathematics May in many
59:45 senses because I remember we used this
59:48 book for my machine learning classes and
59:50 then it was Heavy to to the class
59:52 too it was it was Heavy indeed but I'm
59:55 telling you uh if you spend time and you
59:59 actually focus and let's say you have a
1:00:01 two-hour block you block your time and
1:00:03 you go through that it's one of the best
1:00:05 things that you can uh that you can read
1:00:07 to understand the mathematics behind
1:00:08 machine learning and how it really uh
1:00:10 works and of course LinkedIn helps a lot
1:00:13 with different posts and resources that
1:00:15 are being recommended I think on a
1:00:16 day-to-day basis LinkedIn is my uh goto
1:00:19 resource
1:00:21 website so Cassi I think this is how I
1:00:24 know her from LinkedIn cuz she I don't
1:00:27 know if she's active anymore but she
1:00:29 used to be quite active on LinkedIn and
1:00:31 this is where I would see her
1:00:35 content this is amazing yeah podcast uh
1:00:39 uh YouTube LinkedIn of course uh yeah I
1:00:42 think she was all over the place I think
1:00:44 now she's building something on her own
1:00:46 this is why she left Google and I'm
1:00:48 really interested to see what this is
1:00:50 going to be I know this is about
1:00:51 decision making and decision
1:00:53 intelligence which is something she has
1:00:55 established uh on her own so yeah I'm
1:00:58 really looking forward to to seeing her
1:01:01 content yeah thanks yanis for joining us
1:01:03 today for sharing all that you shared
1:01:07 with us today and yeah it was amazing
1:01:10 thanks for finding time and thanks
1:01:11 everyone else too for also joining us
1:01:15 and uh being active here I think uh I
1:01:18 actually forgot yeah we had on the one
1:01:21 question that I accidentally forgot to
1:01:24 mention
1:01:25 well yeah that's
1:01:26 fine maybe is it okay yanis if K reaches
1:01:31 out to you on LinkedIn and asks this
1:01:33 question yeah absolutely uh I'm always
1:01:36 open I'm I'm super active on uh LinkedIn
1:01:39 so any question whatever that may be uh
1:01:41 feel free to to reach out on LinkedIn I
1:01:43 make sure to uh to get back to you okay
1:01:47 thanks and with that um I guess we
1:01:49 finish so have a amazing and thanks for
1:01:52 having me yeah thanks bye bye everyone
1:01:56 bye bye
