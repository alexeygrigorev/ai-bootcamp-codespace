1:31 yeah so welcome welcome to our event
1:34 thank you alexa yeah thanks for having
1:35 me i'm happy to be here
1:38 yeah before we go into our main topic of
1:41 career coaching let's start with your
1:42 background can you tell us about your
1:44 career journey so far
1:46 yeah sure i
1:48 i studied engineering
1:50 so my father
1:53 was an engineer and he very much was my
1:55 role model so i was really influenced by
1:57 him
1:59 and then i went into management
2:01 consultancy so i worked there for 10
2:03 years
2:04 and towards the end yeah there was
2:07 something missing
2:08 so i left and actually i went to live in
2:12 italy for two years with my boyfriend at
2:14 the time who yeah now my husband
2:18 and so this was a huge disrupter i would
2:21 see in a significant thing that
2:23 influenced my career so and i went to um
2:27 to live in the dolomite so i was on the
2:29 top i'd gone from london to the top of a
2:31 mountain
2:32 and
2:34 i think really what happened there was i
2:36 had two years
2:37 um
2:38 where i was able to sort of break away
2:41 from the social pressures that we tend
2:43 to have that influence our choices for
2:45 careers
2:46 so we kind of think that we're
2:48 independent thinkers and that we just
2:49 make up our own minds but often the
2:52 networks that we're part of or maybe our
2:54 families have a big influence in us
2:57 and um yeah being there
2:59 i think that's what i let go of so i
3:01 felt very free to make choices about
3:03 what i did next
3:05 but i had no idea what it would be just
3:08 really by the end of that time in italy
3:10 i knew what it wouldn't be you know i
3:11 had a big long list of things i didn't
3:13 want to do and so
3:15 i returned to london at this point and
3:17 then i found a coach
3:20 um
3:21 and this was another significant point
3:23 for me so
3:25 this was the first time that i saw
3:27 something different you know i'd come
3:29 from this really quite analytical
3:30 background and here i was talking about
3:33 psychology and
3:35 yeah it was new to me and it was really
3:37 interesting to me
3:39 um
3:39 [Music]
3:40 and this is another thing that affects
3:42 our career so this was quite random you
3:45 know so we tend to think that somehow we
3:47 can plan out our career and we have this
3:48 ten point plan and we can sort of
3:51 reflect and think it all all out but
3:53 you know how could i ever have have
3:56 predicted this i couldn't so this was
3:58 the first thing that was random but the
3:59 other thing is when we're trying to work
4:01 out what we want to do is we often can't
4:03 think our way out of it we need to have
4:06 a new experience and like get new data
4:08 actually that we can reflect on and so
4:10 this is what happened to me i bumped
4:12 into something that i liked the look of
4:13 and also i reflected and realized yeah i
4:16 was more interested in
4:17 and people and technology people and
4:20 actually psychology than than i had
4:23 first thought so
4:24 um after this i became the head of
4:27 careers at business school in london
4:30 this was challenging because i had never
4:32 done this before and i had a team and i
4:34 was supposed to know what i was doing so
4:36 this was challenging but i found my
4:38 place really i really liked it i
4:40 realized that education was something i
4:42 liked because it was worthwhile this had
4:44 been what was missing and consulting for
4:46 me
4:47 um
4:48 yeah i did a few other things in berlin
4:50 but now as you said i'm doing something
4:52 similar i'm in a career role in helping
4:54 people who want to transfer into tech
4:57 either as data scientists or yeah full
4:59 stack developers
5:02 yeah interesting so can you tell us a
5:04 few words about the the school the
5:05 spiced academy what do you do there
5:08 um yeah so we have um
5:11 we have a full stack program so it's
5:13 three months long
5:15 and people come from all different
5:16 backgrounds really truly from you know
5:19 we have musicians artists
5:22 some people who've maybe come from a
5:24 more quantitative background um and
5:26 they're learning uh you know
5:28 predominantly javascript
5:30 and then they're going on to be either
5:32 front-end or back-end developers
5:34 and and then we have a data science
5:36 program
5:37 so there we are teaching
5:40 predominantly python and how to build
5:42 machine learning models sql
5:45 and again it's people are transitioning
5:49 often into data science but also
5:50 analytics sometimes into consulting
5:54 roles or sometimes just going back to
5:55 the job they did before but they need
5:57 the data skills
5:59 yeah
6:00 yeah i think the the school is quite
6:02 prolific because now if you
6:04 take any company in berlin they probably
6:06 have a graduate working there or at
6:08 least they know that this school exists
6:10 so they're doing quite a good job thanks
6:12 for doing that
6:15 yeah so before this conversation i
6:18 wanted to do some research to prepare to
6:20 know what kind of questions i can ask
6:22 you and i found an article about career
6:24 coaching
6:26 and that article was saying that a
6:28 career coach
6:29 helps with
6:31 cv review project and portfolio review
6:33 job search tips interview preparation
6:36 giving advice about career switching
6:39 helping with of negotiating a better
6:41 offer
6:42 and this seemed like a very long lease
6:45 to me
6:46 like first of all i wanted to ask you is
6:49 do you think this is an accurate and
6:50 complete list and do you agree with this
6:52 list or not
6:55 uh yeah for the most part i would say
6:56 this is quite accurate um there's some
7:00 things actually i would add to it and
7:02 maybe one thing i would take away so the
7:04 thing i would take away would be
7:06 when they say portfolio review this
7:08 isn't something that i would do i would
7:10 not be looking at their github and
7:12 making comment on this
7:14 um although there would be some sales
7:16 study where they could understand what a
7:18 good github would look like um this is
7:21 not something you do this is something
7:23 somebody else in the boot camp is doing
7:25 right
7:26 yeah this would be a you know one of the
7:28 teachers would be helping with it yeah
7:30 um
7:32 but everything else on there i would
7:33 agree with i think the thing maybe
7:36 that's missing for me is
7:38 um
7:40 yeah one thing i find is that people
7:42 often um
7:45 are quite negative when people are
7:46 changing their career they can be quite
7:48 dismissive
7:50 and quite negative about what they've
7:52 done so far in their career you know so
7:54 they tend to
7:56 um
7:58 actually need help to really extract out
8:01 what their previous achievements have
8:02 been
8:03 um and i think this is partly this
8:05 legacy where we feel like we should
8:07 start on a career and have this sort of
8:09 linear path which definitely is no
8:11 longer the case
8:13 um
8:14 and so they can yeah
8:16 they can really need help reframing
8:18 their past i would say in a way which is
8:20 a helps them sell themselves in their
8:23 new career but more importantly just
8:24 makes them feel better
8:26 and generally
8:28 they don't have an objective view of
8:30 what they've achieved like for example
8:32 maybe someone's come from academia
8:35 and they might say yeah i just spent 10
8:38 years there but i didn't make it you
8:40 know this is the way they would frame it
8:42 but actually
8:43 the truth is the reason why they're
8:46 leaving is because they have actually
8:48 succeeded there for a long time but
8:49 they're fed up of having to fight to get
8:52 you know projects because there's a
8:54 diminishing number
8:56 and actually what they really want is a
8:57 more stable job so they have been
9:00 successful it's just that they're now
9:01 looking to do something else
9:04 um and i always find the people is
9:06 really quite a brave thing to do you
9:08 know you've done this for 10 years like
9:10 and to make a change they're brave so i
9:12 would say this is missing
9:14 um
9:16 it's like encouraging people
9:18 yeah looking negative at past
9:19 achievements
9:21 exactly yeah
9:23 i think so um
9:25 it's reframing it actually
9:27 it's more than encouraging i would say
9:29 and then the other thing i think is just
9:31 helping people get clear about exactly
9:33 what job they want to do so this might
9:35 sound strange because we're at a
9:36 bootcamp where it's very focused uh but
9:38 there's still lots of other things
9:40 you've got to think about you know like
9:42 do you like working in a structured
9:44 environment or unstructured like risky
9:46 non-risky competitive collaborative so
9:49 this type of thing so actually just
9:51 helping people make sure that when they
9:53 get the job that they're as happy as
9:54 they can be
9:56 and how do you do that how do you help
9:58 people who
9:59 understand what they want like let's say
10:01 i guess this is like whether they want
10:03 to work in a corporate
10:05 environment or a startup right what kind
10:07 of startup it would be or what kind of
10:10 corporation it would be this kind of
10:11 things right
10:13 yeah it's this kind of things i mean you
10:15 can ask through questioning so i think
10:18 um
10:19 you can
10:21 just make people reflect on this
10:24 not not only in a hypothetical way but
10:26 on what's happened in the past and then
10:28 also like a bit like i was describing
10:30 you can craft some experiments so you
10:32 can you can encourage people to try some
10:34 things out in a sort of
10:36 safe way first of all to get clearer
10:39 about what they want to do
10:40 um
10:41 [Music]
10:42 yeah but i would say essentially what
10:44 you're describing this describes mostly
10:46 what i do
10:48 i think that there is a comment from one
10:49 of your former students
10:51 that anna is saying that she definitely
10:53 agrees with making people feel good
10:55 about themselves is very important and
10:57 you are definitely good at this
11:02 i actually have a friend he
11:05 was a lawyer
11:06 now he's a data scientist he was a
11:08 lawyer
11:08 and i think i heard this what you
11:11 mentioned being negative about previous
11:12 experience as a lawyer and completely
11:15 neglecting and saying this experience is
11:17 not worth anything let's not put it to
11:20 my cv at all let's not mention
11:23 uh that at all let's just pretend it
11:25 never happened right and what do you how
11:28 do you find how do you help people
11:30 to not do this let's say we have a
11:33 lawyer
11:34 and this lawyer says that
11:37 whatever they did in the last 10 years
11:39 is not like it's worthless right so how
11:42 do you convince them that it's not
11:44 actually worthless that's actually a
11:46 good experience that is worth putting on
11:47 cv you just need to put emphasis in the
11:50 right
11:51 way yeah
11:53 yeah well i think um yeah the first
11:55 thing is to have a very honest and open
11:58 conversation about what they think they
12:00 failed at so you give space to let every
12:03 you know to let all of this come out i
12:05 think and then to try to talk encourage
12:08 them to think about right what were
12:10 their successes and some people really
12:11 struggled to do this i didn't achieve
12:13 anything you know so you can extract
12:15 this um
12:17 and then
12:18 so this is the sort of warts and all
12:21 exploration
12:23 and actually in when you do this people
12:25 will things that people have said oh
12:27 this is when i failed they start to
12:29 realize that really this wasn't an
12:31 objective view you know so this is the
12:33 first thing and then there's the second
12:35 part which is packaging it up you know
12:37 and the two things are are related but
12:40 distinct i would say so when it comes to
12:42 packaging it up
12:44 um i mean the first thing i would ask
12:46 would be like first of all have you
12:48 worked with data so
12:50 this lawyer
12:51 may or may not have probably yes like
12:54 they have to find be able to find like i
12:57 don't know how they do this because
12:58 there are so many laws and then they
12:59 need to locate the right one right
13:01 yes
13:02 yes
13:04 exactly so so this is the first thing is
13:07 that and just like you said a lot of
13:09 people have worked with data but they
13:10 somehow haven't recognized it they say
13:12 oh but it's not what i'm doing now and
13:14 it's like no it's not but but let's work
13:16 out what you've done so so this would be
13:18 the first thing to get them to
13:20 put on their cv
13:22 um
13:23 where they have worked with data and
13:25 then the
13:26 second thing would be where they have
13:28 demonstrated similar skills
13:31 so maybe for example a data scientist
13:33 you know so
13:35 maybe someone like an engineer for
13:37 example might have built simulation
13:39 models and it's quite different
13:41 in some respects but there's
13:42 similarities so there's some sort of
13:45 evidence that it would be similar to
13:46 machine learning um
13:49 so that would be the second thing you
13:50 would do okay and then the third thing
13:52 would be these transferable competencies
13:56 um
13:57 so problem solving and analytical skills
14:00 you know when have you done this a lot
14:02 of people have done this already
14:04 um
14:05 and here it's important to describe it
14:08 in a way
14:10 uh this achievement based like what
14:12 people tend to do they say oh yeah i've
14:14 got evidence of this but then the way
14:16 they describe it is sort of um
14:18 responsibility based
14:20 you know and and they use the language
14:22 that makes sense from their previous
14:24 domain
14:25 or industry and it's not always
14:28 comprehensible um to someone who's not
14:31 in this so i see this all the time
14:33 everybody does this all the time because
14:35 of course when you're writing it you
14:37 understand it
14:38 but you don't understand you forgot what
14:41 it's like to not be an expert in it you
14:43 know yeah so this responsibility is uh
14:46 like finding uh i don't know what
14:47 lawyers do i'm just
14:49 i hope i don't offend anyone but like
14:52 finding the right laws and things like
14:54 this right but then this is not
14:56 achievement this is responsibility this
14:58 is what you are doing but achievement
15:00 would be like helping uh you know this
15:03 customer
15:04 get that right
15:06 yeah i'm sure there will have been some
15:08 very complex analytical thing that
15:10 they've had to work out
15:12 but we don't need to know the detail of
15:14 this and using law of terminology that
15:16 we don't understand we just want to
15:17 extract it up you know like so they were
15:19 chosen by their manager to manage this
15:22 particular client or project
15:24 and during this they demonstrated
15:26 problem-solving analytical skills so you
15:28 give evidence but you also point out the
15:30 obvious you know
15:32 um
15:34 and so there would be other skills like
15:36 fast learner like i'm sure as a lawyer
15:38 you have to learn fast you know so again
15:41 you would show this communication would
15:43 be another one
15:45 um
15:46 so there are many things that we take
15:47 because we know this even i'm sure in
15:49 your job and my job yeah i do the things
15:51 that you listed out but i also do other
15:53 things that are not related to my
15:55 specific um expertise
15:58 and uh yeah we have to be around it so
16:02 yeah i think by the time we we've spent
16:04 maybe two or three sessions doing this
16:06 then it sort of because they're more
16:08 comfortable and also they're able to
16:11 have produced something which is
16:13 convincing to someone that doesn't know
16:15 them yeah okay so each student gets uh
16:18 two three sessions with you
16:20 to talk about all these things
16:23 well actually the way we do it is uh we
16:25 have unlimited access so
16:28 uh
16:29 of course people don't come like a
16:31 hundred times if everyone did this and
16:33 it wouldn't work there's actually myself
16:35 and my colleague olga so there there are
16:37 two coaches now uh but we actually uh
16:40 work with people whenever they want
16:42 right up until they get their job
16:44 so it is unlimited and people don't
16:46 overuse it so that's why it
16:48 works but typically on average is it
16:51 like two to three sessions is it more or
16:53 is it less
16:54 i think the average maybe is four yeah
16:59 so do you see people who do not need
17:02 your help at all and
17:04 they just don't have any problems with
17:06 finding a job other people like that
17:09 there are some people yeah there are
17:11 some people who we wouldn't see at all
17:13 so sometimes there are people who
17:16 get a job
17:18 easily uh sometimes there's people who
17:20 we don't see at all who maybe are the
17:23 ones who need the most help so there's
17:24 also this category of people
17:27 um
17:28 so yeah there are some there are some
17:30 students that would only see in a group
17:32 you know so we also offer uh group
17:34 sessions
17:35 uh where we all come together we offer
17:37 five group sessions on various topics
17:39 and then one to ones and we might not
17:40 see them in the one-to-one yeah
17:43 and how important is it in your opinion
17:46 to have career coaches for bootcamps
17:49 let's say what happens what would happen
17:51 if there was no career coaches in the
17:54 bootcamp where you were working
17:58 yeah well we did have this experience uh
18:01 once because last year actually i had
18:03 covered so i was out for a while
18:05 longer than than you would normally be
18:07 with a kind of standard virus
18:10 so um
18:12 yeah i think the impact the impact would
18:16 be that um
18:17 [Music]
18:18 some people i think
18:21 wouldn't attempt to make the move you
18:23 know so they would maybe just uh return
18:26 to their old jobs without really trying
18:27 it and i think this would be because
18:30 they wouldn't believe they could
18:31 actually do it
18:33 um i think one thing the coaches do is
18:35 we keep the history of what's happened
18:37 to all the students you know so we have
18:39 i mean a lot of it we have in our head
18:40 and of course we have some data but
18:42 we're able to explain
18:44 profiles of people
18:46 and and how and what sort of role
18:48 they've got after the camp and so again
18:50 it's sort of like this evidence base
18:51 where we can share this and i think this
18:53 helps with people's beliefs
18:55 [Music]
18:56 yeah i think other people might
18:59 get
19:00 find it difficult to navigate the market
19:02 um so
19:04 they might target the wrong job first of
19:06 all or
19:08 take longer at least take longer to work
19:10 out how to do or worst case it might not
19:12 work at all
19:13 um some for sure will have cds that are
19:16 good for the job they did before but no
19:18 good for data jobs so
19:20 you know the paperwork will be wrong and
19:22 they might not get interviews and i also
19:24 think some people would fall out to
19:25 interview because they're not quite sure
19:27 how to explain their strengths or their
19:29 weaknesses so i think it would have an
19:31 impact but
19:32 i also have the faith that people would
19:34 find their own way you know somehow they
19:36 would find their own way but yeah i
19:38 guess we we do make a small contribution
19:40 to that
19:41 yeah you mentioned a few problems so
19:43 first
19:44 people
19:45 sometimes don't believe in themselves
19:47 and they think okay i
19:49 wouldn't get this job so i will not try
19:51 i'll go back to whatever i was doing
19:54 then you also say that another problem
19:56 is
19:57 their cv is not prepared for the job
19:59 they need so they probably do the cve in
20:02 the old way while they need to change it
20:04 slightly then also interviews maybe they
20:07 are not prepared
20:08 so
20:09 are there other problems people have and
20:11 uh
20:12 yeah so yeah absolutely
20:15 yes there you go
20:17 yeah i just wanted to
20:18 ask another question but then i realized
20:20 maybe it's too many at once so
20:23 let's start with that so are there
20:25 other problems other problems um
20:28 yeah i would think one other problem i
20:31 see is that sometimes people
20:33 know that they want to work with data
20:35 but they don't have a
20:37 good understanding of what all the rules
20:39 and possibilities are so they don't
20:41 really understand the marketplace
20:45 so we would do a session maybe to help
20:47 them with this you know so for example
20:49 what there isn't standard terminology
20:51 yet you know so what some person might
20:53 call a data scientist this might
20:55 actually another person might call it
20:57 analytics so we have this textbook
20:59 definition but people don't get it you
21:01 know and so you they would get contr
21:04 this is confusing i think when you come
21:06 into a new sector it can be confusing
21:08 anyway but this is something data has
21:10 that it's still emerging
21:11 um or things like for example i was
21:14 reading last year because of covet there
21:17 was less budget available for data
21:19 science and so like a machine learning
21:22 engineer rule was getting merged into
21:25 the data science role
21:27 and people therefore have to be able to
21:30 write better code which ends up in
21:31 production you know
21:33 code that can perform and be stable
21:35 um and then this ultimately has an
21:38 impact on the junior data scientist
21:40 maybe has to now be able to know more
21:41 python so
21:42 it's very difficult to navigate your way
21:45 around this
21:46 um
21:47 or there's also new rules coming up like
21:49 an analytics engineer you know what is
21:51 this
21:54 i'm still reading actually i think it's
21:55 a data engineer that works in an
21:56 analytics team but you know this type of
21:58 stuff it's not so obvious um or also you
22:01 look at data science rules and it's got
22:03 a data engineering skill set on it
22:05 you're like what is this and you know
22:07 this is because some places they can't
22:09 get the data engineer so they're asking
22:11 the data science to do it it's very
22:13 ambiguous
22:14 um so
22:16 this they have to understand and then i
22:18 think the second issue this is okay now
22:20 i get this which is complex but i don't
22:22 know where do i fit in in this like
22:24 what's the first you know how do i
22:27 make my first move into this data world
22:31 um
22:32 and so
22:34 this is something that we would do in an
22:35 individual basis you know so we may be
22:37 talking about the landscape in a group
22:40 and then
22:41 we might speak to someone and say okay
22:43 what do you already bring so some of the
22:45 things we've touched on at all already
22:47 and it's quite difficult for people to
22:49 do that so we might say okay do you have
22:52 linear algebra they're like yeah of
22:54 course i have it's like okay but you
22:56 have to be explicit put this on your cv
22:58 you know do you have calculus yes also
23:00 put this on your cv
23:02 um
23:03 or
23:05 maybe even like a small online course so
23:08 perhaps before the bootcamp you've done
23:10 something that
23:11 they think is trivial but it's actually
23:13 important because as a recruiter if i
23:16 look at someone's cv and i can see that
23:18 they've been interested in data actually
23:20 for the last two years and they've
23:22 self-taught something or they've done a
23:24 small course then this starts to build
23:26 up a picture
23:28 um
23:30 and then yeah we just then help them
23:32 work out what their first move would be
23:34 you know
23:36 see yeah quite complex and what among
23:38 these problems
23:40 what do you think is the most difficult
23:41 one to
23:42 to help with
23:44 um
23:47 i mean i think one problem that i didn't
23:50 maybe mention yet actually which
23:52 possibly is the most difficult is that i
23:54 think
23:55 getting students orientated around the
23:58 role
23:59 is
24:00 it's okay you know eventually they
24:02 understand and they know what they want
24:03 to do and they also understand how to
24:06 package themselves one thing which i
24:08 think people struggle with is when
24:09 they've come when they're doing these
24:12 boot camps is
24:14 often people will say to me
24:16 i'll say what job do you want i want to
24:18 be a data scientist and they'll say okay
24:20 but what else like what industry what
24:22 domain any particular technology i don't
24:25 care just you know i just want to be a
24:26 data scientist i love it
24:28 and somehow this flexibility and
24:31 openness you might think is the best
24:33 strategy you know this is going to lead
24:34 to like your more chances of getting a
24:37 job but it actually doesn't this it
24:39 doesn't work too well because
24:41 um
24:44 if i
24:45 yeah if i'm a recruiter i don't see it
24:48 uh e-commerce place like zelando or
24:50 whatever and i get in a cv and a cover
24:53 letter from someone and i can sort of
24:55 tell they just want to be a data
24:57 scientist you know i'm going to get
24:58 hundreds like this but if i get one
25:01 where they've said okay
25:03 i get the the i understand the
25:05 e-commerce market you know i understand
25:07 your business i want to build
25:09 recommender systems you know because i
25:11 know
25:12 quite a lot of machine learning doesn't
25:14 make it into production but i know this
25:15 will and i want to have an impact on the
25:18 business and they have it very tailored
25:20 and maybe they even have their final
25:22 project as a recommender system then i'm
25:24 much more likely to interview them um
25:28 but what can be ha what can be difficult
25:30 for people is if you don't if you
25:32 genuinely don't have a focus how do you
25:34 get it you know um yeah i was going to
25:37 ask that
25:38 so what we would do to try to help
25:41 people is well first of all it's okay to
25:43 have a strategy a mixed strategy so you
25:45 can send out some stuff genetically this
25:48 is fine
25:49 but the thing that works well is if you
25:51 try to at least find some interest areas
25:54 um so we actually use um
25:58 a model it's called icky guy
26:00 so it's japanese so icky is means life
26:04 and guy means worth doing
26:06 so this is a model that helps you you
26:08 know
26:09 find your ultimately
26:11 your ultimate job that you would love
26:13 um and what it suggests is that you
26:15 start with what the world needs okay so
26:20 of course the world needs lots of things
26:21 but what you'll do is if you're a data
26:23 person is you can start to look at a
26:25 very high level of the types of things
26:28 that the world's asking for so you start
26:30 really reading
26:31 high-level
26:33 trend reports you know so i read one
26:35 recently and it said okay in 2022
26:39 um
26:40 cyber security this is probably going to
26:42 be the most built
26:45 machine learning model
26:46 maybe this resonates with me or it
26:48 doesn't you know or climate change or
26:50 whatever but what you'll find is that
26:52 you will naturally be drawn to some
26:54 topics that are of interest to you at a
26:56 very high level so this is a good place
26:58 to start and then when you have a few of
27:00 those
27:01 that are interesting to you then you can
27:03 drill down a little bit so you say okay
27:05 climate change so what
27:07 user cases are there in machine learning
27:10 whether it's where it's actually been
27:12 applied
27:13 um and you get curious about this you
27:15 know so then maybe you do your final
27:16 project in it and
27:18 you end up writing a better tailored cv
27:21 cover letter and when you go to
27:23 interview you have some things to say
27:25 um
27:26 so yeah there's more to it than this but
27:28 just to give you a flavor this is some
27:30 way you might start to get some sort of
27:32 focus
27:34 yeah so having focus is a good thing but
27:36 yeah that's that's true
27:38 yeah i remember also
27:40 i guess i was lucky when i was switching
27:43 because uh i didn't have a focus i would
27:45 i would just
27:46 work anywhere just hire me
27:50 yeah but what's interesting is when
27:51 people's people do say this when they're
27:53 getting off the boot camp but when you
27:54 catch up with them 18 months later they
27:57 they say oh yeah i didn't like it
27:58 because x y and z and so it's not really
28:01 true you know it feels like this in the
28:03 moment
28:04 and um
28:07 there's this advice of course that you
28:09 shouldn't be too picky which is also
28:11 true but within this huge landscape of
28:13 stuff that you could do at least try to
28:15 look for the thing
28:16 that might work best for you
28:20 yeah and since uh i guess most of the
28:22 graduates are looking for a job in
28:23 berlin there is there are many companies
28:25 to choose from right so you can have
28:28 this focus so you
28:30 it's not like there are just two
28:32 companies that are data scientists right
28:34 no i mean i looked i looked uh i was
28:36 before i spoke to the students last last
28:38 week i had a look and i was looking at
28:40 the number of junior roles
28:42 on linkedin i do this periodically and
28:45 actually i did it when i first started
28:46 and the the jump
28:48 in number was huge i mean i think for
28:50 data analyst junior positions that was
28:52 over 800 and when i started it was 60 so
28:54 that i started two and a half years ago
28:58 data scientist was a bit less 550 i
29:00 think and so this was and data
29:02 engineering was less than data analytics
29:04 first time i've seen this
29:05 that actually there was more analytics
29:07 jobs in engineering
29:09 and yeah berlin but we also have
29:11 campuses in other parts of germany
29:15 yeah
29:16 yeah so that
29:17 in 2020 when coveted companies
29:21 started to reduce their budget they
29:24 stopped hiring juniors right so now
29:26 it's back to uh
29:28 to before covet even even numbers are
29:31 higher right right now right for junior
29:32 people yeah they're higher and i think
29:34 this is it there's a backlog and also my
29:37 sense is that of course there's been a
29:39 lot of digitization so there's a lot of
29:41 analytics
29:42 jobs
29:44 um
29:45 and this is why i think it's it it's the
29:48 the order of magnitude is even higher
29:51 for analytics you know and it's also
29:53 more necessary it's maybe got a more
29:55 immediate impact sometimes on businesses
29:57 i think like sometimes a lot of
29:58 companies i think are still playing with
30:00 machine learning so
30:02 um
30:03 yeah but analytics is needed by a lot of
30:06 places now
30:07 there's a lot of data that we've
30:08 generated like we're doing now
30:11 a lot of online stuff
30:12 and coming back to
30:14 focus to have in focus when looking for
30:16 a job
30:18 how much research do you think people
30:19 should put in learning about companies
30:21 before they apply should they just
30:23 how to say spray and pray just apply
30:26 everywhere or they should do a bit of
30:28 research and then select the first niche
30:30 and then select a few companies then
30:33 learn as much as possible about them and
30:35 then apply
30:37 um
30:38 yeah i think there's no right answer and
30:40 it depends on your situation so
30:44 if you have a background
30:46 that allows you to spray and pray as you
30:48 say it can work you know so for example
30:50 say you've worked in consultancy
30:53 and you want to go back into consultancy
30:56 and you're going to take your new data
30:57 skills with you
30:59 then you could probably do quite a
31:01 yeah a genetic campaign you know so
31:04 maybe you don't even bother with a cover
31:05 letter you just like tailor your profile
31:08 and you just throw it out there
31:11 um if you've done something completely
31:14 different and you're it's gonna be a
31:15 leap then you have to make more effort i
31:17 would say
31:18 um
31:20 and you can have a mixture so i don't
31:22 think it's an either or you can have a
31:23 mixture
31:24 so you can have some tailored stuff and
31:26 some genetic things
31:29 um
31:31 yeah
31:32 yeah you can you there's no there's no
31:35 right one answer it depends on your
31:36 situation
31:37 um but generally i would say if you
31:40 don't if you just sit down at linkedin
31:43 and you do genetic cover letters of
31:44 genetic cvs and just start applying
31:46 willy-nilly it's going to take you
31:48 longer this is what i see
31:50 the job search usually is longer
31:53 okay so better to have some focus so
31:55 apply
31:57 so i guess as you said to have some
31:58 balance so pick a few companies do
32:00 research apply to them
32:02 tailor your cv cover letter to these
32:05 companies and then in the meantime also
32:08 spray and pray right
32:11 and i would ask what you've said is that
32:12 if you can if those companies
32:15 can belong to some sort of
32:17 um
32:18 industry or domain or even technology
32:21 focus and that's even better because
32:22 then you can really do some research at
32:24 this high level as well
32:27 and you can be quite knowledgeable
32:29 and you know hopefully get something
32:31 that you're interested in you know
32:32 because when you get in there you might
32:34 not want to be right and be great and
32:36 recommend about recommender models for
32:39 people to buy more dresses you know
32:40 maybe you want to do something else so
32:43 um it makes a difference i think
32:45 yeah we have a question from amin so
32:48 does uh
32:49 the spiced academy provide career
32:51 coaching without the bootcamp or you
32:54 have to go to the bootcamp to get career
32:56 coaching yeah that's an interesting idea
32:58 no we don't
33:01 but it's an interesting idea but
33:02 currently it's it's not a separate
33:05 service on its own right now
33:07 okay and do you have any advice for
33:09 people
33:10 say somebody wants to career to find a
33:12 career coach so for example there is a
33:14 question from
33:15 michael so he's a self-taught student
33:19 do you have any suggestions for him to
33:21 find a career coach should should he
33:23 actually do that should he find a career
33:25 coach and if yes
33:27 how would you recommend finding one
33:31 i mean if i were him i would probably go
33:34 to linkedin
33:35 and i would do a search there so and
33:38 then i would look at
33:41 the qualifications like have they
33:42 actually done a qualification as a
33:45 career coach
33:47 um how many years experience do they
33:48 have and also maybe the quite often
33:50 career coaches would have
33:53 recommendations from the people
33:55 and then you could connect to them and
33:57 actually talk to these people and see
33:59 what it was like i think also
34:02 coaches are willing to do like a quick
34:05 15 20 minutes you know just chatting
34:07 because you do you need to have some
34:09 other than just the skills you need to
34:10 have some sort of connection
34:12 um i think the other thing i would do is
34:15 choose one that was in the city i wanted
34:17 to work in probably and
34:20 maybe the sector as well
34:23 so
34:25 i mean a lot of some of it is genetic
34:27 but if you yeah if you're working with a
34:29 career coach who doesn't know anything
34:31 about data then it's going to be much
34:32 trickier to get something so you know
34:36 so you want to have a career coach that
34:38 specializes in data ideal data science
34:42 uh and in the city or at least return
34:45 where you want to find your job
34:47 yeah i think that really helps you know
34:50 then there is a quite a big topic that i
34:52 also wanted to talk about and this when
34:55 people don't believe in themselves and
34:57 as we talked about this is one of the
34:59 reasons that
35:00 people decide not to look for a job yes
35:03 they just don't believe they
35:05 are good at this and they would find
35:07 anything
35:08 which is thing called imposter syndrome
35:11 and i think everyone has it
35:13 i
35:14 always like every month um i
35:17 i
35:18 um
35:19 i
35:20 have these thoughts of okay am i good
35:22 enough or what am am i doing is good
35:25 enough for the company or not good and
35:27 then i have to convince myself that it's
35:28 actually good try to get external data
35:31 right so i think everyone has this
35:34 so
35:34 and does this problem come up a lot in
35:37 your
35:38 coaching sessions
35:41 yeah for sure um it does and um
35:45 i think
35:48 yeah i mean i it comes up a lot and i
35:50 think it is a big topic and i agree with
35:53 you that we can all suffer from it um
35:56 [Music]
35:57 and i think to just expand the outside
35:59 like to you know so what can we do about
36:01 it i think it's also interesting you
36:02 know so i think to sort of answer that
36:05 question it's good to sort of understand
36:07 like how does it come about that we feel
36:09 like this you know
36:10 um so
36:14 yeah the way i might try to
36:17 to encourage us to think about it is
36:19 first of all imagine imagine for a
36:20 minute like you've decided to maybe not
36:23 go to a boot camp but pretend that
36:25 you've been a bootcamp okay so
36:27 uh you take your cv and you invent it so
36:30 you say okay i've done a three month
36:32 uh data science bootcamp when you've not
36:34 and then maybe you put your cv in you
36:36 get invited to interview and
36:41 uh you get someone to do the off-site
36:43 coding challenge you know the internet
36:44 it's a thought experiment or you
36:46 actually suggest doing this
36:48 now this is the thought experiment
36:50 together
36:51 about it because it's quite complex to
36:53 understand like it's quite a strange
36:55 thing we do like you've said like you
36:56 know you're a senior data scientist and
36:58 you're doing this every month you know
36:59 so like how do we get to this it's not
37:01 often
37:03 if not often yeah yeah okay
37:06 so um
37:08 so then
37:10 imagine this person's got someone to do
37:12 this off-site coding challenge okay so
37:15 how far are they going to get with this
37:17 right so
37:18 i would imagine there's a good chance
37:19 they're going to get found out at
37:21 technical interview stage but let's
37:23 imagine they don't for some reason they
37:25 don't and they make it and they're in
37:26 the job
37:27 and
37:30 how long are they going to survive there
37:31 you know in this team with senior data
37:33 scientists data engineers product
37:35 managers like we can't really imagine
37:37 they're going to make it to the friday
37:38 okay so
37:40 um
37:41 so what's happening there this
37:44 like if you are a fraud
37:47 then the people round about if you're
37:49 surrounded by people who basically know
37:52 the topic well you're not going to
37:55 survive okay so isn't it quite odd when
37:57 you think about it therefore that we're
37:59 a lot of us spending time in situations
38:01 where we've maybe been happily employed
38:03 by for years in a company and received
38:06 really good feedback
38:07 um and we're still feeling these
38:10 feelings of like an imposter so what's
38:12 going on there and
38:14 so really the only way to understand
38:16 this is that those people that are
38:18 surrounding us have um have some
38:21 objective view about us and that's
38:24 different like their i mean of course
38:26 their view of us is still subjective but
38:28 if we
38:29 say it's a number of people and take
38:31 take the
38:32 point of view that it's an objective
38:34 view of us then it means that our view
38:36 of our self
38:37 our subjective view of herself is
38:39 distorted in some way you know the only
38:42 explanation is it's about perception of
38:44 ourself
38:45 and
38:47 so
38:48 maybe because i know about me much more
38:50 than others
38:51 yeah this is the thing okay so so then
38:53 we think how can this be so i know
38:55 myself but just like you say i know
38:57 myself better than everyone else like
38:59 this is real i feel it's very painful
39:01 we've all felt it and it feels very true
39:04 and yet we can't really be a frauds
39:06 because we wouldn't
39:08 survive i mean it's kind of paradoxical
39:10 but to feel these feelings you actually
39:12 have to be successful you know you
39:13 actually have to have got into a
39:15 position where you're being employed or
39:17 you've got the job to feel them um
39:21 so
39:22 to understand like how do we end up with
39:24 this selfie that's somehow um distorted
39:27 like you really need to think about how
39:29 do we form our identity it's not
39:30 something we think about very often
39:32 right but how do we actually
39:34 form this self you like you say you know
39:36 yourself but do you
39:37 i would ask you
39:39 so uh
39:41 the way we develop this is
39:44 first of all in our families you know
39:46 this is our first experience of life and
39:48 they give us uh labels sometimes very
39:51 overtly
39:52 sometimes
39:53 subtly and unconsciously but they tell
39:55 us things about ourselves and we
39:57 internalize these and we very much
39:58 believe them you know
40:00 we've got no other choice
40:03 um and then we get older and we join new
40:05 networks so we go to school for example
40:07 you know so say i come from a family
40:09 environment where i've kind of decided
40:11 somehow i'm not good enough in some way
40:14 and then i go to school
40:16 and um yeah i the teacher tells me i'm
40:19 sort of outstanding and i get really
40:21 good marks so here out here i am with
40:24 sort of lots of evidence so what do i do
40:26 with these two conflicting things you
40:28 know so at this young age what we tend
40:30 to do is we
40:31 we give more waiting to what we've been
40:33 told in our family
40:35 but we have this conflict like what are
40:36 we going to do with this advice that's
40:38 coming from from this external source
40:41 and what we tend to do is we find a way
40:44 to dismiss it so we say oh well i only
40:46 got good results because i studied very
40:49 hard or i was lucky i actually
40:52 understood what would be coming up on
40:53 the exam
40:55 and we dismiss it
40:58 so the positive stuff gets dismissed
41:01 we have this belief that somehow we're
41:02 not good enough
41:04 so we and we carried this pattern on we
41:07 then go into the workplace and as soon
41:08 as we receive some negative feedback wow
41:11 this gets their attention we believe
41:12 this
41:13 uh and we tend to
41:16 uh ignore
41:18 the positive stuff so yeah there's a
41:20 sort of name for this confirmation bias
41:22 you know you you you look like what we
41:25 look for we find
41:27 um
41:29 so then we can start to see how we would
41:31 be doing this okay and
41:34 so i think the first step in solving
41:36 this is to actually recognize that you
41:38 have it like you've said like you can
41:39 kind of recognize that it's not true in
41:42 some way
41:43 but often if you do feel like an
41:45 imposter you don't walk around saying oh
41:47 yeah i've got impostor syndrome you're
41:49 saying to yourself i'm actually not good
41:51 enough and i'm keeping this quiet i'm
41:53 not telling anybody i don't want to tell
41:55 it to my manager
41:56 no no
42:00 it's very hidden so
42:02 so the next step is to think okay so
42:04 what is the trigger what is the thing
42:06 that happens before we get to those
42:08 thoughts
42:09 um
42:11 and so at work we're often given a task
42:13 okay and then
42:15 our tasks are challenging you know we're
42:16 in workplaces we're asked to do stuff
42:18 that we don't always know how to do so
42:20 maybe we do this task and 80 percent of
42:22 it we do well but the other 20 doesn't
42:24 go so well um so when we have this
42:28 you're basically like a fork road you've
42:30 got two roads you can go down so one
42:33 road would be
42:35 to focus on the bit that went wrong oh
42:37 my goodness how can i have done this how
42:39 can i have missed this
42:41 thank goodness my boss wasn't there
42:43 because otherwise i would be out in my
42:45 ear okay so we're very quickly got to
42:47 feeling like an imposter
42:50 this will cause us to have certain
42:53 usually bad coping strategies so we'll
42:56 become stressed maybe overwhelmed
43:00 uh
43:01 can lead to different behaviors
43:02 depending on your particular situation
43:05 but maybe you become a perfectionist you
43:07 overwork you try to polish things so
43:10 you're in this sort of space okay
43:12 um another way would be the other fork
43:14 in the road
43:16 would be where we would say okay well
43:18 actually we'll spend some time looking
43:19 at what went well
43:21 and we will also look at what didn't go
43:23 well but from this point of view of
43:25 saying right what could i learn from
43:28 this what
43:29 first of all you do have to process it
43:31 it's still uncomfortable no one likes to
43:32 fail or mess up
43:34 but we kind of process it and think what
43:36 can i learn what can i do differently
43:38 what are my skills gaps
43:41 and this leads us down the road of
43:43 acceptance of failure and the fact that
43:45 we can
43:47 make mistakes and go on to be better
43:50 um
43:52 so even though we can explain this so we
43:55 have this choice of these two different
43:57 roads um this happens in the blink of an
43:59 eye now let you know this situation
44:02 happens and we're already there so
44:04 really what we're seeing is that we need
44:05 to take time to look at our self beliefs
44:09 how that affects our thinking and
44:11 ultimately our behavior
44:13 because it is a sort of self-fulfilling
44:14 style it's self-fulfilling obviously you
44:17 know
44:17 um
44:18 so how can we do this so yeah there's
44:21 three things i would suggest like you
44:23 can get a book so there are books there
44:26 on imposter syndrome
44:28 uh there's one
44:29 i have it here actually because i was uh
44:32 yeah something i have i show you it's
44:34 from the 1960s it's definitely got a
44:36 1960s look about it um it's by dr
44:39 pauline clancy she this was the first
44:42 person who coined this phrase imposter
44:44 syndrome
44:45 um
44:46 and in there you'll find this and
44:48 there's other books you'll find
44:49 exercises that would help you try to
44:51 change some of this aspect about the
44:53 name of the book oh yeah it's um
44:56 the imposter phenomenon
44:58 when success makes you feel like a fake
45:01 it's a little bit dated now because when
45:02 this was done in the 60s she talks in
45:04 here for example about the fact that
45:06 more women than men suffer from it which
45:09 is not true although i think it was
45:11 probably true then because society was
45:13 giving women the beliefs that they
45:15 couldn't work you know
45:17 and so but things now it's that the
45:19 research shows it's the same it's not
45:21 gender specific
45:23 um
45:25 yeah so there's some things in there i
45:27 think they can help or the other thing
45:28 you can do is work with a
45:30 career coach if you find that you can't
45:32 solve it on your own
45:34 um because this is the thing you're
45:35 trying to solve your self-perception
45:38 and you're likely to stand in your own
45:40 way you know so it can be useful to have
45:42 someone to help you
45:43 um if you don't want to work at that
45:45 level the third piece of advice i would
45:47 give you is to find a mentor
45:50 so there's plenty of technical mentors
45:52 out there that will help you for free
45:54 like mentoring club for example that's
45:56 one of the sites and this person can
45:59 help you so maybe they're a senior data
46:01 person and when something is happening
46:04 you can shade it and they can just
46:06 lead you they're more likely to lead you
46:08 along the path of saying okay right what
46:10 do you need to learn
46:12 um
46:15 and as you as you were saying like your
46:17 question was also about like does it
46:18 happen often at the bootcamp and i would
46:20 say yeah yeah because i'm
46:22 curious so for example for me i know so
46:25 i've been in this industry for quite a
46:27 while i
46:28 have worked as a data scientist for last
46:31 i don't know six seven years for quite
46:33 some time so i learned how to live with
46:35 this feeling but i imagine for somebody
46:38 who is just
46:39 starting their career they're not even
46:41 started yet they want to switch so they
46:44 enrolled in the boot camp and now they
46:46 think okay all this my experience as a
46:48 lawyer is
46:50 worthless
46:51 right
46:52 and then now i look at this list of
46:55 things i need to know to apply for the
46:58 job
46:59 and then i can see how that can lead to
47:02 this feeling that okay i'm not good
47:04 enough let me go back to being a lawyer
47:08 yes you're right what do they do yeah
47:10 what do you do so i would say at this
47:12 when we're changing careers this is a
47:14 particularly fragile time for imposter
47:17 syndrome as you said even more in the
47:19 workplace it can be challenging
47:21 um
47:23 and part of the reason for this is is
47:25 that of course we're in something new
47:27 and our skills are emerging so another
47:30 thing that affects our identity is the
47:32 things that we repeatedly do every day
47:34 we internalize you know we develop
47:36 skills and achievements and we
47:38 internalize these and these form part of
47:40 our identity so if i do maths
47:42 you know
47:44 calculations for for the last two two
47:46 years then i can say yeah i'm good at
47:48 maths
47:49 um but of course when we're moving into
47:51 something new like we've done python for
47:52 three months we're not going to feel
47:54 confident in it so
47:56 i think there's an acceptance
47:58 that this is the case and i think the
48:00 thing is it's the same thing about these
48:02 forks so we can decide okay when i apply
48:04 for a job this means i'm in a poster and
48:06 actually i won't bother
48:08 or we can say it's emerging i've
48:11 actually found something i enjoy
48:13 and this is a really important thing
48:14 because i meet people who don't ever
48:16 find this you know so if you found
48:18 something you you enjoy and you can see
48:21 that you could get good at it then this
48:23 is enough um so you're on the second
48:25 path of thinking okay i'm developing it
48:28 um
48:30 and i think this is the second challenge
48:32 about moving into a career in tech other
48:35 sectors are like this but tech
48:37 particularly in data science even more
48:39 specifically
48:41 is that there's so much to learn
48:43 um first of all and secondly if there's
48:45 not an obvious structural path
48:48 you know if i think i told you my dad
48:50 was an engineer if i think of his career
48:52 paths you know so he spent four years
48:54 learning it
48:56 was really structured then then he did
48:58 an apprenticeship then he you know he
49:00 spent 20 years and it was very
49:02 structured
49:04 and so i think one thing that can really
49:06 help when you come off a boot camp
49:08 is to say okay when i finished
49:11 what are my gaps between where i am now
49:13 and what do i need to get the first
49:15 junior role
49:17 and you can find this out by asking
49:18 people who've already done it you know
49:20 so i would go to like linkedin and i
49:23 would find a lawyer who'd then become a
49:25 data scientist and i would connect and
49:27 say right tell me how did you do it or
49:30 um
49:31 so you can create your learning path
49:34 from where you are to where you need to
49:35 get to
49:36 um
49:37 and i think the other thing is once you
49:39 get in a job as well
49:41 so then expand this you know so i would
49:43 find someone within the firm
49:45 and say right i want to have a high
49:48 level picture even if it's something
49:49 that you're not going to learn for for
49:51 the next couple of years but it will
49:53 help you because say for example within
49:55 because this is the thing like when you
49:56 get the job this helps you know you've
49:59 got your first job so you start to
50:01 really believe it
50:03 because also part of our identity is
50:05 feedback from other people you know i
50:06 cannot decide for example that i'm
50:08 sporty if nobody else in the world
50:10 agrees with me so we also make our
50:12 identity based on the direct feedback we
50:15 get from others
50:16 um
50:18 and say you're in a meeting the first
50:19 few months and people are all talking
50:21 about some technology and you have no
50:22 clue what they're talking about then
50:24 this feeling is going to be really
50:26 strong
50:27 but if you're able to say okay this
50:28 technology it's a data engineering
50:31 technology i can see it on my plan over
50:33 here my learning plan and i'm going to
50:35 get to it then this helps
50:38 and i think the other thing that helps
50:40 is to think about building your skills
50:43 in terms of a t shape
50:45 you know so the the top bar
50:48 is the width so you know that there's a
50:50 certain number of topics that you need
50:52 to cover in your role and you won't be
50:54 able to do them all in depth but work
50:56 out what is the depth going to be like i
50:57 think this is quite anchoring if you
50:59 have at least one topic and as you get
51:01 more senior there'll be more than one
51:03 topic it's something that you know
51:05 really well
51:06 then um i think that helps
51:09 um
51:10 the other thing i think helps when
51:12 you're coming off a boot camp and as you
51:14 see you're changing for the first time
51:15 is
51:17 on getting clear about what is the
51:19 expectation
51:20 of the rule
51:22 because i find students um
51:24 of course they're not clear in this
51:26 because we've just explained how muddy
51:27 the
51:28 marketplace is but they tend to
51:30 exaggerate it you know so they'll say
51:32 look i've got no chance and they'll show
51:34 me almost show me a job ad and they'll
51:35 say look i need a phd in statistics
51:38 to be a data scientist i was like okay
51:40 so you're not going to do this role
51:42 but there's plenty of rules where you
51:44 just need a linear regression and if you
51:46 don't know how to do this then actually
51:48 you can go and do some data analytics
51:50 for a while or maybe even be a business
51:52 and you know intelligence analyst and
51:54 just do sql for
51:55 six months so there's always a way and i
51:58 think again by connecting and talking to
52:00 people and no one will give you the same
52:02 answer actually because there is no one
52:04 answer but you will start to see that
52:06 what's expected of you at a junior level
52:10 is achievable
52:11 um
52:13 and yeah so working on your inside and
52:15 understanding what the outside it needs
52:17 you will you will get there i mean i see
52:19 it happen every day hundreds and
52:20 hundreds and hundreds of people
52:23 get it
52:24 yeah yeah we have quite a few questions
52:28 so
52:29 the first question i see is about
52:31 internships compared to
52:33 so we have internships and we have
52:35 junior positions
52:37 so do you see um
52:39 your students applying for internships
52:41 or this is only for students
52:44 and is it even advisable to
52:46 to do internships or they should aim at
52:49 permanent roles
52:51 yeah so this is a good question and it
52:53 depends on the person so yes for sure
52:55 there are some students who do
52:57 internships first of all the number of
52:59 internships that's available compared to
53:01 juniors is really small so the ones that
53:03 you'll find in linkedin i don't know how
53:05 many there are today but they can be
53:06 really a small number
53:09 um
53:10 so
53:11 and it depends on your situation uh
53:14 whether you need it you know like so if
53:15 you are a structural engineer you have
53:18 all the maths
53:19 uh you know you already coded a bit
53:22 you're gonna go for a data science
53:24 position and structural engineering firm
53:26 then no
53:27 you can just probably go straight in
53:29 you know if you're if you don't have
53:31 you're not bringing a lot of that with
53:32 you then yeah why not
53:34 if you can do it financially you know it
53:36 can be a good route and like i can think
53:38 of one student who especially and it
53:40 also depends on the role like if you
53:42 want to be a data engineer you know
53:44 you're not going to it's difficult to
53:46 walk into a data engineer during your
53:48 data engineering role but i've seen some
53:50 students go and do a six-month
53:52 internship and then
53:54 they're there they've got a junior role
53:56 this is quite a quick way to get it
53:58 um
54:00 so i think it depends on the individual
54:03 but for sure i think it's a great
54:06 it's a great route now the other thing
54:08 i'd want to just say on this is that as
54:10 i said you won't necessarily find a lot
54:12 advertised in linkedin but you can
54:14 generate them like through networking i
54:17 see a lot of students connecting and the
54:19 person says okay
54:21 they don't call it an internship but
54:22 they say you come in my team for six
54:24 months if it works out then i'll make a
54:26 position for you so you can also
54:28 generate opportunities that maybe aren't
54:30 aren't
54:31 even there actually
54:34 yeah actually with internships it's
54:36 tricky uh
54:37 um some of the internships we had we
54:40 closed them without
54:42 going public let's say with them because
54:45 usually it's the moment we publish it
54:48 it's just too difficult with to deal
54:50 with the
54:51 amount of applications that's why we ask
54:53 hey do you know anybody who is
54:55 you know looking for an internship and
54:57 maybe we have one position so this is
55:00 how i found an intern then i was looking
55:02 for an intern so it was through smaller
55:04 communities not
55:06 advertising this publicly on linkedin so
55:08 this is a good suggestion to connect to
55:10 people
55:11 to to find this
55:14 another question we have what advice
55:15 would you give for working with
55:17 recruiters
55:18 um
55:20 yeah so
55:22 depends what level you are so if you're
55:24 looking for a junior they won't have
55:26 junior positions
55:27 but they still might be willing to speak
55:29 to you because once you get into data
55:32 you've kind of got a job for life so at
55:33 some point you know you might become
55:35 their clients
55:36 and if you are more senior
55:39 um i would say find a good one and stick
55:41 with them that's what people do
55:44 um how do you find a good one i mean
55:46 word of mouth but also um
55:49 yeah you'll find maybe someone that's
55:51 like boutique specialized in data you
55:54 know they tend to do salary reports
55:57 um i mean yeah there's
56:00 there aren't so many actually there's a
56:02 few in germany and quite a lot of them
56:03 are london-based so yeah i have a list i
56:05 think of about eight that i would maybe
56:07 recommend maybe i can share it with you
56:09 if people want a list i know only one
56:11 germany based most of them are from the
56:13 uk i don't know why it's the case why
56:15 the uk company is
56:17 uh higher in germany but this this is
56:20 interesting and this is what we see
56:22 usually so when i get a call from
56:25 a number that starts with 44 i know that
56:28 it's a recruiter
56:30 yeah that's interesting yeah i've seen
56:32 that
56:32 i mean how to handle them yeah i mean
56:35 i i think that's the main way to handle
56:37 them is if you get a good one then they
56:38 can be really helpful and if they're not
56:40 then just there's no point actually
56:42 having a conversation
56:44 have you seen your students succeed with
56:49 with a recruiter like were they helpful
56:52 or
56:52 maybe students shouldn't
56:55 you know spend their time with recruiter
56:57 and apply directly to companies
57:00 well almost all of our students are
57:02 going for junior roles and recruiters
57:04 get paid
57:05 a fee so they're
57:07 they're very few i can think in a
57:09 handful of people who've actually got a
57:11 job through a recruiter
57:14 sometimes they get found on linkedin by
57:16 recruiters this can sometimes happen
57:18 but it's more yeah it's more of the
57:20 exception than the rule so they don't
57:22 routinely phone them up but one thing
57:24 you could do if i were a student i would
57:26 phone them up and say hey i'm a junior
57:29 but like tell me which companies are
57:30 hiring for juniors right now what what's
57:33 what's happening because they will share
57:34 this with you
57:36 um
57:37 because
57:38 a lot of them think about the long term
57:40 i mean some might not reply
57:41 might not respond now we do actually
57:44 have someone who comes in from orange
57:46 quarter and talks to our students
57:49 thomas he's particularly good and he's
57:51 always happy orange quarter is a name of
57:54 the company the name of the company is a
57:55 uk company
57:57 and
57:59 they've got a lot of information about
58:00 salaries what's happening right now
58:02 which sectors are recruiting so i would
58:05 take advantage more from this angle at
58:07 the junior level than really they don't
58:09 have junior roles
58:12 yeah thanks maybe the last question
58:13 because i see we're almost out of time
58:16 uh if you can answer this quickly
58:18 because this is more maybe a more
58:21 complex question than it looks like so
58:23 the question is about can you give some
58:24 tips for networking on linkedin
58:28 um
58:29 okay so quickly if i try to do it
58:31 quickly i would say
58:33 um
58:35 send a note that's going to
58:37 encourage the person to connect to you
58:40 okay and you connect then at the this uh
58:42 this note right
58:44 so how can you add a good note choose
58:46 someone who's got a similar background
58:48 as you you know so i'm scottish
58:52 a mechanical engineer i want to be a
58:53 data in a data scientist choose someone
58:56 from that profile they're more likely to
58:57 help you if they're similar to you
59:00 um
59:01 make it like a little tiny mini cover
59:03 letter so make yourself credible
59:05 and just ask an informational question
59:08 something that you really want like how
59:10 did you make your career move start
59:11 gentle and then from this you it will
59:13 develop into something so reframe it
59:16 make it about asking questions that
59:18 you're trying to get the answers to
59:21 and don't feel like you're networking
59:22 but it'll happen naturally
