1:09 because we are about to start so now we
1:12 can
1:12 we can start right so this week we'll
1:15 talk about career transitioning from
1:17 quality assurance to machine learning
1:19 and we have a special guest today Alvaro
1:21 Alvaro worked in the cell phone industry
1:23 as a quality assurance engineer but got
1:26 tired of it spent a few years unemployed
1:28 fell in love with machine learning and
1:30 eventually got hired by a consultancy
1:32 company right now either is managing
1:34 machine learning and NLP projects I got
1:37 to know elevaro when he took part in our
1:40 machine learning and data engineering
1:41 Zoom camps on our courses and he
1:44 published published awesome notes if
1:47 you're taking the course right now you
1:49 must have seen his notes they are really
1:50 amazing if you haven't please do check
1:52 them out and he helped a lot other
1:55 students during the course and I'm very
1:58 happy to invite Alvaro to this interview
2:00 and talk about his creator
2:03 thank you very much for having me
2:05 yeah you're welcome thanks uh thanks for
2:07 joining us so let's start with your
2:09 background can you tell us briefly about
2:11 your career Journey so far right I
2:14 studied in Spain I'm from Barcelona
2:16 Spain and I studied here I I studied um
2:20 informatics engineering which is uh in
2:23 in the Spanish education the old Spanish
2:24 education system used to be like a mix
2:26 of Computer Engineering and computer
2:28 science so we did lots of programming
2:30 but we also took a look at you know
2:31 Hardware side of things
2:33 um I did that I started working for a
2:36 company a cell phone company
2:38 um for a bit here in Spain we did
2:41 um Quality I actually did quality
2:43 assurance
2:45 um so I received prototypes I tested
2:47 them
2:48 um
2:49 and then this company changed
2:52 um not they did not change fans but they
2:54 changed like the founding model or
2:56 something so the um
2:58 um
2:59 they they started focusing more on Latin
3:01 America uh so after uh I took a gap year
3:04 and then they they actually they
3:06 actually called me and said hey would
3:08 you like to come to Mexico and work for
3:09 us again and I said yeah sure why not so
3:11 I went there I worked there for four
3:13 years and almost four years
3:16 and I decided that I did not like that
3:18 kind of job anymore I did not enjoy the
3:21 industry at all and I decided to quit I
3:23 went back to Spain I was unemployed for
3:27 two years I studied in the meantime and
3:30 until I found machine learning and I
3:33 eventually got I managed to get hired by
3:35 uh by a company working in machine
3:38 learning
3:39 yeah interesting and how did your day
3:43 look like when you worked as a quality
3:45 insurance engineer Insurance engineer so
3:47 you mentioned that you received
3:48 prototypes and you tested them so was it
3:51 like I don't know getting a phone like
3:53 that and then you know
3:56 yeah it's it's not it's not like um
3:58 software QA like for software testing we
4:01 did not get I did not do any kind of
4:02 unit testing or anything like that I
4:04 just received the Prototype and I I did
4:06 field testing I would like went outside
4:08 and check the GPS and check the maps
4:10 navigation how it worked uh I tested the
4:13 sound I tested the microphone recording
4:15 I tested all the sensors in the phone I
4:17 did battery testing like see how it will
4:19 how well it performed I checked for
4:21 translation issues
4:24 um the way the way with this kind of
4:25 companies work is
4:27 um the actually most of the design and
4:29 and construction and pretty much
4:31 everything is done in China like if you
4:32 have money and you want to build your
4:34 own brand what you do is you go to China
4:36 and then you contact an oem or a odm
4:39 actually like a design house and they
4:42 will do everything for you so you only
4:44 have to put the money you have to put
4:45 the um uh your branding and you have to
4:48 take care of the importing and the
4:50 paperwork in your country and so you can
4:52 find that many different small and long
4:55 own Brands will sell the same phone in
4:59 different countries just just with
5:00 different branding because they just
5:01 went to the same design house and they
5:03 already offered a ready-made solution
5:05 and that's how they work sometimes you
5:07 can also find
5:08 um exclusive designs which is what my
5:10 company did
5:12 um so we actually had the signs that no
5:14 one else had but they were still
5:16 everything was designed in China
5:18 and but but since I I actually would
5:22 have liked to go to China and and get
5:25 involved in that part of the design and
5:27 development but eventually
5:30 um and and luckily it was not meant to
5:33 be I decided to change careers and
5:37 that's it but yeah I just received a
5:39 prototype I tested it and then made a
5:40 report and sent it back and then I would
5:42 get a software update which I would
5:43 flash onto the phone and test it again
5:44 that's pretty much the workflow but I
5:47 guess you also had some sort of test
5:49 suits like things you need to test some
5:51 sort of checklist right yes yes of
5:53 course some documents it wasn't like
5:55 okay uh let me think what I test today
5:58 right let me let me test GPS I mean at
6:00 first it was kind of like that then we
6:02 act as as we got more professional we
6:05 started doing our own checklists and we
6:06 earn our own tests uh there's also in
6:09 particular for Android phones you are
6:11 supposed to pass um you have to certify
6:14 your phone with Google if you want to
6:16 um to to have the Google apps in your
6:19 phone because otherwise you're not
6:20 allowed to and and you have to meet
6:23 certain criteria and you have to pass
6:26 certain tests so that's called the CTS
6:28 uh I don't remember what it stands for
6:30 actually uh it's been a while but
6:33 um but I actually used to do that as
6:35 well I mean most of the CTS testing was
6:38 performed was carried out in China uh
6:40 but sometimes I would have to repeat
6:42 those tests uh and in back at home and I
6:45 would repeat those most of those at
6:46 least because some some of them were
6:48 required
6:49 um special equipment which I did not
6:50 have but yeah
6:52 there's also a more specific tests like
6:54 um RF testing which is you need a
6:56 special lab for it which of course I do
6:58 not have either
6:59 well I can imagine that at some point it
7:02 becomes a bit repetitive right and you
7:04 basically need to run through the same
7:05 checklist with a new firmware update
7:08 right and then it's uh okay let me check
7:12 GPS let me check this thing yeah it was
7:14 very repetitive uh sometimes you would
7:16 get new tests because new requirements
7:18 would come in like for instance we
7:19 started working in voiceover LTE back in
7:21 Mexico so we had to do new tests for
7:24 voice over Realty uh stuff like that you
7:26 know
7:27 um so new requirements needed a new test
7:29 but essentially it was all um testing
7:31 and refinement of the previous tests
7:32 sometimes the most exciting things would
7:34 be like oh we have to do this specific
7:36 field testing which is uh get on a car
7:38 and then start a call and then drive in
7:41 a specific route and you had to avoid
7:44 um well the if you would pass a test if
7:47 the call would not drop essentially and
7:49 you would also call the
7:51 um the carrier and Engineering in the in
7:54 the telephone company so they would
7:56 record the actual test as well so they
7:58 would get get all the data and they
8:01 would tell you whether you've passed or
8:02 not and then sometimes those routes
8:05 would change and it was like exciting
8:07 but that's pretty much it okay well I
8:10 guess that's what at some point he
8:13 decided okay it's uh too repetitive I
8:15 want to quit right but then yeah it's
8:18 more than that but yeah I mean issues in
8:20 the company like I was not satisfied
8:22 with our output and how the company was
8:25 developing lots of stuff but yeah the
8:29 work itself was pretty repetitive and
8:30 the work the people I worked with were
8:31 very nice but um I did not enjoy that
8:34 kind of work
8:35 and then they decided to quit but then
8:37 you also mentioned that you were
8:39 unemployed for some time so you just
8:41 quit correct without you know looking
8:43 back without looking for the same type
8:45 of job to you know continue so how did
8:47 you find courage to just leave it
8:51 I cheated uh in a way um I have a
8:55 luckily for me I have a very strong um
8:57 family support system and I had super
9:00 um a bit of money saved up so it was not
9:03 I mean it was scary for me in the sense
9:05 that I did not know what I wanted to do
9:07 with my life yet but I was not scared of
9:10 uh am I going to eat tomorrow or am I
9:13 going to have a roof tomorrow that's
9:14 that was not the issue I I quit and I
9:17 went back to my family they were very
9:19 understanding and I started studying
9:21 right away after a month long break or
9:24 something that was my longest vacation
9:25 sort of then I started studying I I
9:30 started studying
9:32 um front-end actually I started looking
9:34 into front-end developing then I quickly
9:36 realized that I did not enjoy that at
9:37 all
9:38 um after a few you know um looking
9:42 around I looked around what I could
9:44 study and then I fell up on machine
9:46 learning which I was interested in and I
9:50 joined a postgraduate degree course and
9:52 I loved it I really really enjoyed it
9:54 and here I am
9:56 so and you kind of knew that you wanted
9:59 to work in it right because you
10:01 mentioned frontland and then you kind of
10:03 looked around what is what else is there
10:06 in the I.T field right and then you
10:08 eventually uh ended up doing machine
10:10 learning I wouldn't I mean I wouldn't be
10:12 opposed to working a completely
10:14 unrelated field but I do not know
10:18 anything about any other fields so I I'm
10:21 I it's what I know essentially and I.T
10:25 is such a wide field such a huge field
10:27 that
10:29 um you can get you can be special you
10:30 can become specialized in a very
10:32 specific thing and and just perform a a
10:36 fulfilling career there in that specific
10:39 Hill so
10:40 um I did not feel like I would have to
10:43 move because I felt like there was so
10:45 much more to explore and so yeah I
10:48 didn't contemplate it at first
10:50 and then why machine learning so you
10:52 mentioned that you were doing front-end
10:54 you didn't like it and then you came
10:56 across this machine learning so what did
10:57 you like about this
10:59 um it was challenging uh I like the math
11:01 it was pretty hard but I felt like wow
11:03 this is um this is substantial like
11:06 because most of what I did before in QA
11:09 I did not really apply what I had
11:11 learned back at school like I didn't I I
11:14 had never worked in software development
11:16 before I had never done
11:20 um anything of the sort so I was
11:22 essentially writing um Excel
11:24 spreadsheets and and that sort of stuff
11:26 which I did not enjoy and I felt like
11:29 when I when I started uh when we started
11:31 studying it and we had to do the project
11:32 for um for the for the course I realized
11:35 that
11:37 um I was having fun uh that's it pretty
11:39 much
11:41 um and I was already interested in
11:43 artificial intelligence and and so
11:48 um because I feel like it's um there's
11:50 so much more to do it yet and
11:52 so I felt like this is a very wide field
11:55 which I can grow in uh so I think it's
11:58 worth
11:59 um diving in and starting it and getting
12:01 good at it so I that's it there are so
12:05 many more things I could I'm interested
12:07 in as well but you know you can't do it
12:09 all so I chose let's get into this and
12:11 let's do it properly so that's it
12:13 sounds like you didn't really have a
12:15 plan right so you're just okay I kind of
12:17 like it let's see what's there and you
12:19 just explore this one step at a time
12:21 right or did you actually have some sort
12:23 of plan my plan was
12:26 um to well it's first I wanted to quit
12:30 and I wanted to have time for myself to
12:32 get myself cleared out and and
12:36 figure out what I wanted to do with my
12:38 life and then I started um I thought
12:41 well I know I'm an I.T kind of guy
12:43 because that's what I know and I
12:45 actually like it and I'm interested in
12:46 the field I keep up with the tech news
12:48 and everything so I I let's see what
12:51 else what else is there
12:53 um I was pretty sure I did not want to
12:54 do QA I also did not want to do regular
12:59 I.T stuff like um sysadmin stuff because
13:02 I I did summer jobs before when I was
13:05 younger and I didn't really enjoy it so
13:08 I started looking I I wanted to get into
13:10 the more the development stuff
13:13 um and when I tried out machine learning
13:15 and I learned more about it and I
13:17 realized what uh what
13:21 the the width of the field and how much
13:24 there was left to do I said I said yeah
13:27 this is a very interesting field I want
13:29 to get into it and so I did
13:32 okay so can you tell us how exactly the
13:34 journey looked like for you so from the
13:35 moment you realized this is interesting
13:37 to the moment you I don't know started
13:40 looking for a job in this field sure
13:43 so um before I joined any course before
13:45 I started anything I asked my friends I
13:49 I keep in touch with a lot of University
13:51 friends
13:52 um and you know some of them are in the
13:54 embedded development some of them are in
13:57 machine learning some of them are in
13:58 elsewhere you know plenty Fields so I
14:01 just ask around like what do you do what
14:02 kind of things do you do do you like it
14:04 would you change something you know that
14:07 sort of stuff
14:08 um
14:09 a couple of friends uh when they talked
14:12 to me about machine learning I said they
14:14 actually recommended it I you should um
14:16 read a couple of books like
14:18 um look check it check this video out
14:19 and then probably join a courses too if
14:22 you are interested in joining a proper
14:23 course but maybe not a full master's
14:26 degree uh then I have this couple
14:29 recommendations here in Barcelona and I
14:30 said okay thank you very much I looked
14:33 at the materials they suggested and I
14:37 joined the postgraduate course I was
14:40 suggested because the
14:42 the head teacher was a very famous guy
14:46 in the University I studied in and so I
14:49 joined it and I loved it that was it was
14:52 just one course right it wasn't a degree
14:54 no it was my degree it was one course it
14:56 was a five month long course it was a
14:58 pretty long course but it was a
14:59 postgraduate course that's not it's not
15:01 a full degree and so I finished it and I
15:04 said I should learn more what should I
15:06 do next uh you know because I the the
15:08 courses started in November or December
15:10 and then finished in April May
15:13 so
15:15 um I thought well I cannot join any
15:17 course any degree right now because it's
15:20 uh at the end of the school year and so
15:22 what should I do
15:24 actually looking at my options and after
15:26 talking about one of my buddies in the
15:28 course he's just he suggested me to join
15:31 um
15:33 um of course during the summer course a
15:35 summer school course uh which I did it's
15:37 called
15:38 um neuromats Academy it's um it's a it's
15:41 a non-profit Association which um they
15:43 do this Neuroscience conferences and
15:46 they also do courses and they it's meant
15:48 for Neuroscience but they also have this
15:50 module this one month long module for
15:53 um deep learning for neuroscience and
15:55 since I was looking for the kind of
15:57 thing like projects
15:59 um for me to build up my portfolio and
16:01 to get more
16:03 um actual experience developing neural
16:06 networks I said let's let's join it that
16:09 was last summer so not not this year
16:11 last year and it was a pretty tough
16:15 course I liked it I don't remember
16:16 almost anything from it because it was
16:19 Neuroscience which I don't know and I
16:20 just I had to I had issues keeping up
16:22 but it's also interesting and then after
16:26 that uh another friend of mine who used
16:28 to live in Berlin he suggested me to
16:30 join data talks club and I said oh you
16:32 sure I'll take a look and I joined the
16:36 machine learning Zoom Camp which I
16:37 really enjoyed then I joined the data
16:40 engineering Zoom Camp which I also
16:41 really enjoyed because it was a part of
16:42 the equation that I
16:44 had almost no knowledge about and and
16:48 then there was the machine learning apps
16:50 which I had to drop out because I was
16:52 already working and I could not keep up
16:55 with everything
16:57 but uh but yeah that's that's it I did
17:00 those three things after the possibility
17:02 course my goal was to build up my
17:04 portfolio by doing projects maybe
17:05 joining a cargo Kegel kaggle I know I'm
17:07 not sure how you pronounce it
17:09 um
17:12 yeah anyway you know what I mean so uh
17:15 I'm perhaps doing a few of those which I
17:18 actually I never ended up doing any
17:20 because I got hired before I could I had
17:23 a chance to start and so you didn't have
17:26 a portfolio I mean apart from the course
17:28 yeah apart from the that street apart
17:30 from my GitHub which is um the my notes
17:32 and the things from the courses and like
17:35 the stuff from my from personality
17:37 course as well that's it I did not have
17:39 an actual portfolio but apparently
17:42 um we're in high demand so they were
17:44 looking they're trying to find as many
17:46 people as possible to get to get
17:50 um to work right now so
17:52 I guess I was lacking that regard
17:56 yeah but so what was the the most
17:58 difficult thing for you like uh so you
18:01 did
18:02 you did a post you did a postgraduate
18:04 course so then you did summer school
18:06 then you did two Zoom camps from data
18:08 talks club and then you started looking
18:11 for a job right so or maybe you I don't
18:14 know when did you actually start looking
18:15 for a job at what at what at what point
18:18 at the beginning of this year perhaps
18:20 because I yeah
18:22 um besides the technical
18:24 um knowledge like how to do actual
18:27 machine learning
18:29 um I actually had a few gaps about how
18:31 to you know how to uh approach an
18:33 interview how to
18:35 um prepare your your your curriculum
18:38 Vita your um
18:41 that sort of stuff you know like those
18:43 soft skills that you need to actually
18:45 get higher which are not actually
18:46 related to what you're supposed to work
18:48 in but you have but those are hurdles
18:50 that you have to pass anyway if you want
18:52 to get hired so I hired a coach and
18:55 which uh and he helped me
18:58 um figure out this stuff like um let's
19:01 get starting in you know he got me
19:03 started on how to talk to people how to
19:06 um
19:07 you know how not to be confrontational
19:09 but at the same time how to
19:12 um plant your feet in the ground and how
19:14 to you know defend your your interests
19:17 and then how to prepare my CV how to you
19:20 know because also CVS are becoming more
19:22 I actually showed you my CV and you said
19:25 I prefer the kind of CV which is like a
19:27 list of things which is what I used to
19:29 have but then my coach said yeah that's
19:31 fine but nowadays most of people don't
19:33 want to actually look at the list of
19:35 things because they just want they have
19:36 so much things to sort through so they
19:38 will have they want something visual
19:40 they need something visual so I
19:42 understand yeah so I did my sibena more
19:45 visual manner
19:48 um that sort of stuff anyway
19:49 um I manage you know through some
19:52 contacts as well like I'm looking for a
19:53 job okay I have this guy who's
19:55 interested so let me talk to him and
19:56 maybe you can get an interview oh cool
19:57 yeah I I still apply through you know
20:00 LinkedIn but then I also got in touch
20:01 with my contacts who got in touch with
20:03 some more people and I eventually
20:04 started some processes and I started one
20:08 process before I actually was serious
20:10 with my coach and that did not go well
20:13 uh because the person who interviewed me
20:17 um started asking pretty tough questions
20:20 like things like so you have a data
20:22 frame but this data frame uh in pandas
20:25 actually exceeds the memory size you've
20:27 got in the memory available in your
20:28 system so what happens then and I was
20:30 like I don't know man I mean like I said
20:31 the parent will crash or something but
20:33 I'm not sure what happens then uh you
20:35 know that sort of low level stuff that I
20:37 was not prepared at all to do
20:40 um yeah he told me I mean it's it's
20:42 thank you for the interview but you're
20:44 in a very Junior position and we were
20:45 looking for someone more experienced I
20:47 was like yeah sure uh whatever thank you
20:49 for the the opportunity but that's it
20:52 then I did a couple more processes uh
20:55 um the two the two first ones were an
20:58 interview in order to get to know the
21:00 people and then I was supposed to do a
21:02 technical exercise uh the first one
21:04 after the exercise I got rejected they
21:06 told me thank you but we're not
21:07 interested
21:08 um the second one they actually made me
21:10 an offer but that was after I had done
21:13 the third interview the third process
21:15 which did not have a technical aspect uh
21:20 Beyond a few various questions that they
21:22 wanted me to ask they wanted they asked
21:24 me right there in the interview
21:26 and they made me an offer in that
21:28 interview and I said sure let's go for
21:29 it and
21:31 but yeah maybe if the second process if
21:35 the process from before the offer had I
21:37 had received the offer um before I had
21:39 done the third interview I might have
21:42 accepted it so who knows maybe I would
21:43 be working for a different company right
21:44 now uh which is which yeah and all of
21:48 these companies well except the first
21:49 process which did not go well but these
21:51 three last processes were in where uh
21:53 NLP related which is funny it's
21:55 interesting because I I did not actually
21:57 explicitly looked for NLP projects but
21:59 yeah it's funny how that works did you
22:03 actually have any NLP experience in your
22:06 uh because like in many following our
22:09 Zoom camps we didn't cover that yeah and
22:11 then I didn't know did you study this I
22:13 did some NLP back in my original
22:15 postgraduate course so I was familiar
22:16 with it I was not an expert because
22:18 actually an MP part I did not enjoy it
22:20 as much as some of the other parts of
22:22 the course due to the um
22:24 um you know we had different teachers
22:25 and the teachers we got for that part
22:26 wasn't my favorite but
22:29 um but yeah I did have some experience
22:32 so it's it's I'm not completely it
22:35 didn't come as something completely new
22:37 for me
22:38 yeah we have a few a few questions so
22:42 the first question is what kind of soft
22:44 skills did you have to prepare for your
22:47 data science interview so you mentioned
22:49 that uh like not to be confrontational
22:51 and things like that but uh
22:55 like what was there exactly
22:57 what did they look for and what did you
23:00 need to prepare for
23:02 I didn't I mean I I worked that kind of
23:05 stuff with my coach and the way we did
23:07 it was with role-playing exercises
23:10 um so if you have a friend or you know
23:12 someone who who's actually
23:16 um kind of who could catch who would be
23:19 interested in helping you out and maybe
23:20 he could play the part of being a tough
23:22 interviewer and put things in a
23:24 difficult manner to you like that I
23:26 think that would be a very cool exercise
23:27 to learn to prepare for it but
23:29 essentially it's the um
23:32 um
23:33 it all depends on how you are I'm the
23:34 kind of person who actually didn't
23:36 doesn't I do not know how to sell myself
23:38 to others right I I undersell myself so
23:41 I
23:43 um like I look at what the stuff I do
23:44 and I think yeah I'm not I'm not very
23:46 good at this but then I look at some
23:48 other people's work and I realized wow
23:50 this guy sucks so maybe I'm not so bad
23:51 at it but I'm still
23:54 um you know I'm I'm not I don't have the
23:56 confidence perhaps to
23:57 upsell myself uh so as to actually react
24:00 you know in a way that is actually more
24:02 objective compared to what the actual
24:04 quality of things are so
24:07 um
24:08 for me one of the most difficult things
24:10 was actually not understand myself you
24:13 know like not being
24:15 um
24:15 yeah I'm not that good at this I mean
24:17 you cannot say that to someone who's
24:19 actually interested in hiring you uh but
24:21 you have to but yeah but actually did
24:23 not want to lie either because I did not
24:25 want to sell myself in a way that was
24:28 not
24:28 um that did not reveal reality
24:31 so
24:32 um yeah that for me was that was really
24:34 tough for me but your Zoom cam projects
24:37 were amazing your notes were excellent
24:39 is
24:46 come on I mean some people some people
24:49 were amazing some people were like wow
24:51 this is a very very good project I think
24:53 my prescript was average in both in both
24:55 camps but thank you very much for the
24:57 compliments can you tell us about these
25:00 projects
25:02 um the practice I did for the sun camps
25:04 yeah yeah oh man I don't remember
25:05 already I forgot uh the first one was um
25:09 wait let me let me remember uh let me uh
25:12 think the project for the swim camp for
25:15 the machine learning Zoom Camp was I
25:18 found a data set which was kind of fun
25:19 it was a speed dating data set
25:22 um that data set had a lot of features
25:24 like so many features and and so it was
25:29 interesting in in
25:31 because
25:32 um essentially what you had to do is
25:35 um I believe that the the target feature
25:37 was whether they would match essentially
25:40 and but there were a few very dependent
25:44 uh features from each other so you had
25:46 to actually
25:47 the exploratory that analysis step uh
25:50 was of very high importance specific for
25:52 that project and I think that it was I
25:56 could have improved uh I could have done
25:58 much more in that regard uh but it was
26:00 fun I mean it was a very
26:03 um
26:03 fun project to do because it was
26:05 something completely unexpected so it
26:08 was very funny I found that I found a
26:10 data set by chance and for my second
26:12 project for the uh well was that the
26:15 midterm project or was that the final
26:16 project I think that was the mid-term
26:18 that was the midterm right yeah
26:21 what was the let me take a really quick
26:23 on my GitHub
26:24 um
26:26 yeah I think you demoed the midterm
26:28 project right so I think someone is
26:31 interested he we have in the playlist we
26:34 have a demo from Alvaro where he shows
26:36 the
26:37 the project
26:39 oh yeah my second project was
26:42 um
26:45 image classification task yeah I had a I
26:47 had a bunch of uh vegetable data set I
26:50 had fruits and vegetables and yeah it
26:53 was it was a very it was a very standard
26:54 one of the male image classification
26:56 project
26:58 um I think but I I wanted to do
27:00 something with deep learning and so
27:02 that's what I chose
27:03 I just I think I wanted to do something
27:05 else at first but I did not have the
27:06 time in order to because I when I had
27:08 two weeks to to turn in the project
27:11 but yeah and I'm a very slow developer
27:13 that's another issue
27:15 another question we have is did you
27:18 deploy your final projects in AWS
27:22 how was your experience with this yeah
27:24 like did you actually deploy them in
27:27 this in the MLS I did deploy them but
27:30 not to AWS I deployed them to Google
27:32 Cloud I believe Google Cloud okay yeah
27:34 we I use Google Cloud both in my
27:36 personality course and then in in the
27:39 zoom Camp because I was totally familiar
27:41 with it and we were working with um
27:43 Google Cloud because they have a very
27:45 generous credit at the beginning at the
27:48 when you start uh hundreds right yeah
27:51 300 or something yeah it's it's right
27:53 it's like it's really enough for three
27:56 months too bad it's just for three
27:57 months right I could I could use them
27:59 for way longer like for a year I mean
28:03 you can you can do my email account
28:05 number one my email account number two
28:06 my email account number three and then
28:07 keep doing new new accounts so you can
28:09 get those three that create all the time
28:11 but yeah it's not you know I don't feel
28:13 good doing that
28:16 so it wasn't AWS and it wasn't a problem
28:19 for you right sorry no it was everything
28:21 yeah uh I did we did use AWS for
28:25 um for doing the course right because we
28:27 used them uh to deploy
28:30 um tensorflow the embedded in in Lambda
28:35 and that stuff which is yeah but you
28:38 used it too or you did this in Google
28:41 Cloud no I did use it for the course I I
28:44 followed um AWS I followed the AWS steps
28:47 for the course but then my final project
28:49 was in Google Cloud
28:51 okay interesting and so how did you
28:54 solve this uh problem of not being able
28:57 to sell yourself because the projects
28:58 you just described they look amazing to
29:00 me but then at the same time like you
29:03 say ah there were people that had way
29:06 cooler projects I mean I mean I mean
29:07 yeah some I remember when we were to
29:10 when we had to do peer reviewing I I
29:12 looked at some of the brexits I was
29:13 assigned and I was like wow this is
29:15 blowing my mind this is amazing and then
29:17 some of them like yeah this is fine this
29:18 is a good project but some of them were
29:20 like
29:21 way ahead of the rest
29:24 um as regarding you mean your question
29:26 was how to solve how did I solve my
29:28 issue of understanding myself yes or did
29:31 you even so I mean I still haven't
29:33 solved it I think
29:35 but um but I'm working on it I think I'm
29:38 better at it I think because we we just
29:40 recently did some I'm still with my
29:42 coach and we recently did some tests uh
29:44 some exercises and he told me you've
29:46 done some progress with this because at
29:48 the beginning uh you would have like um
29:51 crashed right away at the beginning of
29:52 the interview but right now you are
29:54 stating you're standing around which and
29:56 he he commended me for it
29:58 um so I'm still working on it but I'm
30:00 getting better but yeah essentially it's
30:03 um
30:03 you explain what you do what you can do
30:08 but you don't try to make yourself
30:12 humble nor
30:14 prideful either so just trying to state
30:17 things in a more neutral way as possible
30:19 and do not
30:21 believe it yourself under any comment
30:24 that the interviewer is giving you the
30:26 interviewer is telling you that's
30:28 essentially it
30:29 so basically
30:31 doing the same thing you just did when
30:33 you described projects right you said
30:35 what was the data set you used what was
30:38 the problem you were solving uh what
30:40 kind of tools you use for solving this
30:42 problem right and uh
30:43 that you just give objective facts about
30:47 the project right without saying oh like
30:50 maybe this wasn't the best project I've
30:52 seen yeah that's right I I don't mention
30:55 that right correct I would totally have
30:57 said that like this is not the best
30:58 project but you know it's uh I mean I
31:00 just did right like when I told you
31:02 about that kind of project for the zoom
31:04 Camp I undersold Myself by telling you
31:05 that it was a very run-of-the-mill
31:06 project which I think it is because it's
31:08 just a very simple uh image
31:10 specification problem but
31:13 um at the same time in an interview in
31:15 an in an actual work interview you
31:17 shouldn't say that you just said uh this
31:19 is an image classification problem uh
31:21 which is uses I use these tools to solve
31:23 it and this is the task to solve and
31:25 that's it and then you you let the
31:28 interviewer
31:30 um make uh her own opinion about the
31:32 project rather than offering your
31:34 opinion about it
31:36 okay and third were the projects of any
31:40 use actually when you interviewed like
31:42 did anyone care about your portfolio
31:44 like did you did they ask you about the
31:46 projects
31:47 actually they didn't which was very
31:49 interesting uh because the um they were
31:52 more interested in the technical
31:54 exercises so
31:56 um
31:56 the first interview with uh so we've
32:00 I've talked about four interview four
32:01 processes right the first one which was
32:03 just an interview I didn't go well then
32:05 the middle two which uh involved doing
32:07 homework of sorts like they gave me some
32:10 questions and I had to turn them in a
32:12 week later and the final interview which
32:14 also involved technical questions but
32:16 they were very simple and I got hired
32:17 with it with them
32:19 um for the last three
32:22 um well I was kind of surprised at the
32:24 last interview because I thought that
32:26 the questions they asked me were very
32:28 simple
32:28 but you know they didn't they didn't
32:31 they needed the people and they hired me
32:34 um this the middle two processes which
32:36 were
32:37 um
32:38 the I had a week to solve the problems
32:40 they gave me uh one of them was a bunch
32:43 of questions like hard questions and
32:46 they told me you can look them up if you
32:48 want to but keep in mind that we'll do a
32:51 follow-up interview and we'll ask you
32:53 more questions and you won't have the
32:54 chance to look them up so do whatever
32:58 you feel like and I was like okay sure
33:00 so I try to solve them all without
33:02 looking up anything other than my
33:04 specific notes that I had for my
33:06 previous courses and and then I I did
33:10 have to look up a few a couple things of
33:12 on Google but then I just covered them I
33:14 studied them again like I covered them
33:15 up and I and and that's essentially what
33:19 I did but then that second interview
33:20 never came so
33:22 I I don't know what it how it could have
33:24 been like the second one was
33:27 um a project essentially they gave me a
33:29 data set
33:30 um a weather data set a time series
33:32 essentially and they asked me to
33:34 to figure out
33:36 um how to predict weather uh in a you
33:39 know an approximate manner um which also
33:42 have a financial it was a fun exercise
33:43 because I had never done anything with
33:44 time series before so it was fun
33:48 um and that's it I that for that process
33:51 for the one with the time series that's
33:52 the one company that actually made me an
33:54 offer but um I rejected because I had a
33:57 better offer from the other company
34:03 did any of the interviewers care about
34:06 your knowledge in Cloud
34:09 until they ask you about the cloud or it
34:12 was just these questions that you
34:14 the last um I mean the first one the one
34:16 that went badly
34:18 um I believe that the the the interview
34:21 asked me some Cloud questions but I
34:23 honestly don't remember what they were
34:24 and the last interview
34:26 um they asked me if I was familiar with
34:28 some of them like are you familiar with
34:30 Azure and I said I haven't worked with
34:31 Azure uh but I've I have worked with
34:34 Google Cloud on NATO us before so
34:37 um essentially it's they're all similar
34:39 they just have their own specific quirks
34:42 to each platform but that's that's it
34:44 and I don't remember if there were any
34:47 more specific questions so no so they
34:50 just asked if you know cloud and then
34:52 you said yes and then they were
34:54 satisfied yeah which is why I was
34:56 surprised when I got the offer for the
34:58 last interview because I thought is that
34:59 it like you're not asking anything else
35:01 uh but that's how I also do to be honest
35:05 like I don't know if it makes sense to
35:06 go into specifics of a cloud like I mean
35:09 with a cloud then
35:12 yeah okay we have a comment so it's not
35:15 a question but a comment right I am in
35:18 the current cohort of the ml Zoom Camp I
35:21 always go back to Alvaro alvaro's notes
35:23 after finishing a week and devise them
35:25 uh revise what I learned in a week great
35:29 notes so I do fully agree so maybe in a
35:32 way your notes are like projects because
35:34 he also mentioned that you were
35:37 um preparing for the hard questions
35:38 you're referring to your notes and then
35:41 I wanted to ask you like tell us your
35:44 secret so how did you make this note so
35:46 good
35:47 um like what was your process like man I
35:51 I you probably won't like what I'm going
35:54 to say but I'm actually not very happy
35:55 with my notes because
35:58 um yeah no no no I'm this actually this
36:01 is not understanding and let me tell you
36:02 why
36:03 um I think they are too wordy I think
36:05 they're not notes I think they're more
36:07 like literary work in a way like I'm the
36:11 way I approach them is almost like I'm
36:12 trying to write a book which is not what
36:15 I intended to do actually and and maybe
36:18 can convert them into your book
36:21 I mean I don't know I've never written a
36:23 book before but um the thing is notes
36:26 are supposed to be something that you
36:28 can refer to it's like an extension of
36:30 your brain right like
36:32 um you don't remember a specific thing
36:33 but you know where to look for it and
36:35 you go and look there and then you
36:37 remind you remember everything
36:38 but uh in my latest notes especially for
36:42 the data engineering Zoom Camp if you
36:43 look at those uh they are way too long
36:45 in the sense that
36:47 um they're actually hard it's actually
36:48 hard to go look for specific stuff in
36:50 those notes because they are so long I
36:52 think I actually had to create indexes
36:54 for each lesson because they were so
36:57 long and and I'm not honestly I'm not
37:00 happy with them because I I mean I am
37:02 happy with the content I think I did a
37:04 good job formatting them and I think I I
37:05 actually
37:07 um I had a lot of fun doing them and I
37:09 learned a lot but they do not accomplish
37:12 what they are supposed to do which is
37:14 being uh easy and quick reference to go
37:16 look for stuff like that yeah it's
37:20 actually something I'm very interested
37:21 in but I have not managed to explore
37:23 perfect I know there are these tools
37:24 like obsidian and remnote and all these
37:28 amazing tools that they are out there
37:29 which are used for scientific research
37:32 and everything and I'd really like to
37:34 deep into dig into those but I honestly
37:36 haven't had the time to how to approach
37:38 it because they are a little complicated
37:40 at first there are a few Concepts like
37:41 settled casting and that sort of stuff
37:43 if you want to look up into it
37:45 um
37:46 but yeah I just I just started writing
37:49 in markdown and you know without any
37:51 specific linking between sections and
37:54 then with any gaps I could find like
37:57 um this specific concept is such and
37:59 such then I would add links to external
38:02 Pages if there I thought they were
38:04 meaningful in any way or could help me
38:06 or someone else
38:07 but that's it
38:09 um as for the process how it went I just
38:11 the way I work is I I actually really
38:14 enjoy looking at online videos because
38:16 you can pause them I suck at listening
38:19 and taking notes at the same time so a
38:21 video is great because you can pause it
38:23 at any time like you can listen for a
38:24 little bit then pause it and write down
38:26 what you just listened if you didn't
38:29 catch anything so you have like I don't
38:31 know maybe two screens on one screen you
38:32 have the video on another screen you
38:34 have your editor and then you listen and
38:38 you type right that's it like I I watch
38:40 a little bit of a video then I
38:42 um I pause and then I go to my editing
38:44 window I vs code actually and I just
38:47 write there
38:48 and if there's something more visual or
38:51 anything that I don't feel confident
38:53 with um doing a diagram for it I just do
38:57 a screenshot and then I copy paste it in
38:59 the in the notes I just link
39:00 add a link to the picture and that's it
39:03 and that's how I work essentially
39:06 but so yeah listen a little bit pause
39:08 write down go back then maybe think a
39:11 little bit if something is not clear
39:12 watch it a couple times more and which
39:16 is why it takes me so long to write the
39:18 notes because uh especially in the data
39:20 engineering Zoom Camp uh there were it
39:22 was a very uh that's right dance Course
39:25 and there was so much content to go
39:27 through
39:28 luckily I was not working so I could
39:30 spend all day long notes that's your
39:33 secret right
39:34 if you have free time
39:38 be unemployed and just write down
39:40 everything on the video and then do a
39:42 bit of so you said you also did the
39:44 quite some research right if something
39:46 is Maybe
39:49 not explained
39:51 at all or not explained well you would
39:53 link uh like some other resource that
39:56 explains this thing and then you kind of
39:58 not it's not just notes from the course
40:00 but also notes for you on you know with
40:03 some extra things from you yeah because
40:05 I wanted to understand why we were doing
40:07 some things in a special in in a
40:09 specific way so I sometimes would have
40:11 to expand the explanations in the videos
40:13 with my own research so that's what I
40:15 did uh however in the in the machine
40:18 learning Zoom camp at the beginning my
40:20 notes were very short because they were
40:21 more like actual notes and it was basic
40:24 stuff which I already knew so I didn't
40:25 feel the need to write notes for those
40:27 things and I actually split the content
40:31 of the notes between the actual nodes
40:33 and GitHub guests which are if you are
40:35 not aware of those for anyone who's
40:37 listening is not aware are these
40:40 um
40:41 it's it's this part of GitHub which
40:43 allows you to put actual notes in it
40:46 like an actual um Snippets right yeah
40:49 Snippets of code and stuff like that uh
40:52 but they're not actually attached to any
40:54 repo so just it's just there
40:57 um and I thought I can do some cheat
40:58 sheets and stuff like that and I would
41:01 split
41:02 um writing notes between the the guests
41:05 and the notes but um and some of the
41:08 guests are good I think my like I I use
41:11 I use the the git gists and the conda
41:15 guests I used it all the time those
41:16 cheats are great for me but others I did
41:19 I did another one for python which I
41:21 never use because it sucks and I just
41:22 it's faster and better for me to just
41:24 look up something for python or pandas
41:26 or sci-fi or anything
41:28 um you mean look up in Google right yeah
41:30 look up the mobile is faster and
41:32 actually go look at the guest so yeah
41:34 that was you know but the my the way of
41:37 writing notes keeps evolving and it was
41:39 a continuous experiment in a way was it
41:43 actually useful for you personally I
41:45 mean we as the community we do
41:47 appreciate it because it helps to you
41:49 know go back to them after the video us
41:51 but like for you personally do you think
41:55 now is was it useful for you yeah I I
41:59 they were they were very useful they are
42:02 not
42:03 um
42:03 super useful in the in the specific way
42:06 that notes are supposed to be which are
42:08 quick reference to things
42:10 however the process of building those
42:12 notes was super helpful for me because
42:14 when you actually write down stuff and
42:15 you have to think of how you explain
42:17 those things
42:19 um it actually helps you to it helps
42:22 um the ideas and the content to remain
42:25 in your memory so that in that regard it
42:27 was they were extremely helpful yeah
42:30 uh keep in mind that uh if you ask me
42:32 for anything specific from the notes I
42:34 will probably not remember because my
42:35 memory is not that great but I will
42:36 think that I will go oh yeah this was
42:39 written in that part so I can go check
42:40 it out and then go look it up
42:42 actually uh you know what when somebody
42:45 asks now questions about about ml Zoom
42:48 camp and I think again which video was
42:50 uh was it called they go to your notes
42:54 it's actually it's actually something
42:57 that I do too because uh I mean videos
42:59 are great for explaining stuff and and
43:02 you know but uh if you want to look
43:05 something up quick they're not so good
43:07 because you know you have to scrub
43:08 through the video to actually find the
43:10 point where people are talking about
43:11 something specific uh and people started
43:14 adding those
43:16 um timestamps in the videos which are
43:17 super helpful but it's still faster to
43:20 go to the some written material
43:24 so it's it's better if you look at the
43:25 video first and then once you've read it
43:27 then you can have some you need a
43:30 written reference which is much faster
43:31 than going back to the video
43:33 and there is a comment
43:35 why do you think you're not a good
43:37 communicator I'm listening to you now
43:39 and you're great
43:42 also maybe the coach helped
43:46 do you think uh
43:48 like having a coach in a situation like
43:50 you is important like would you be able
43:53 to do this without the coach I might
43:56 yeah I mean I think it was good from I
44:00 mean I could afford it and I thought why
44:02 not it's it's going to be a faster way
44:04 than doing it by myself but probably you
44:06 can do it on your own maybe you can find
44:08 some
44:09 um self-help books or anything that
44:11 takes you I mean I actually have a
44:13 couple that I even recommended that I
44:14 should read I used to haven't had the
44:15 time
44:16 um like how to talk to people and how
44:18 you know how to negotiate and stuff like
44:19 that uh there we I'm actually we
44:22 actually have some pending exercises
44:23 with my coach to actually how to
44:25 negotiate for a for a pay raise which I
44:28 haven't uh we haven't done yet and
44:31 that's going to be critical for my
44:32 future if I want to you know earn more
44:35 money but
44:37 um
44:39 um but is it important or mandatory no I
44:41 don't think so but it all depends on how
44:44 you are and what resources you've got I
44:46 think it's it's like it's not a
44:47 case-by-case basis I believe
44:50 and yeah there is also a question about
44:52 the coach is uh does the coach of your
44:56 specific coach in this case uh did that
44:59 person give any inputs on dealing with
45:01 the hiring process or it was more about
45:03 uh you know all these soft skills and
45:06 stuff like that
45:08 sorry can you repeat the question again
45:10 yeah so maybe I already phrase it the
45:12 way in the way I understood it okay
45:15 um like what's the coach specifically uh
45:18 helping you with hiring for a data
45:21 science position or it more was more
45:23 like a communication coach to help you
45:25 with uh soft skills
45:27 I mean it was both I mean he did help me
45:30 to actually Target uh
45:34 I mean he he no he knows that I I'm
45:38 inspiring data scientists and I wanted
45:40 to join uh um you know I wanted to work
45:43 in machine learning and so but he the
45:47 coach does not know anything about
45:49 machine learning everything
45:51 um he knows he's learned by me or by
45:54 some other of his clients so
45:57 um
45:58 um I mean he he knows computer stuff he
46:00 studied Computer Engineering as well but
46:02 um but you know he's he's been working
46:05 on for this kind of in this kind of
46:06 field for so long that he hasn't kept up
46:08 with this specific field so
46:11 but most interviews most technical
46:14 interviews are going to be essentially
46:16 similar I mean the the technical stuff
46:18 changes between them obviously because
46:20 they're different fields
46:21 but the way you approach people and the
46:24 way you talk to people and and how you
46:25 should prepare for them it's very
46:27 similar I believe between all of them
46:28 I'm I'm not at least I'm not aware that
46:32 um you should approach
46:33 um an interview in a different manner
46:35 regardless of I mean in depending on
46:38 what uh kind of field you're working on
46:41 um
46:42 I'm honestly I don't think so so uh it
46:45 is it is
46:47 we did work in the in specifics to
46:49 machine learning in the way that
46:52 um I would tell the coach like what I
46:55 think it's interesting about machine
46:56 learning and what I uh what I think it's
46:57 the their potential and stuff and he
46:59 told me oh then in that case if this is
47:00 your opinion then this is how you should
47:02 explain it to to the interviewer because
47:05 that will give the interviewer a a
47:08 better view of who you are right that
47:10 sort of stuff but the specifics of
47:12 interviewing uh are just generic I think
47:15 so it was more like how to approach the
47:18 hiring manager interview around how to
47:21 answer behavioral interview questions
47:22 that's right uh but not uh like how to
47:26 answer what's the difference between
47:27 random forest and things yeah because I
47:30 mean the coaches isn't able to help me
47:32 with that because he doesn't know that
47:34 that's that's that's false on me I'm the
47:37 one who's supposed to know that do you
47:40 think knowing this mathematical or
47:42 implementation details uh do you think
47:45 it's important for the interview process
47:47 for passing the interview process for a
47:49 data science position
47:51 it depends I mean uh it depends on what
47:54 you are what your role is what you're
47:57 being hired for and and obviously the
47:59 kind of person who interviews you for
48:01 instance uh right now
48:03 um
48:04 I just just today I got an email from
48:06 one of our one of the people who's
48:09 working right now in my project and this
48:11 guy did an analysis he's been he's been
48:13 testing uh different neural networks for
48:16 about two months right now and because
48:17 we gave him a model and he took a look
48:20 at it and he's analyzed it and he
48:24 essentially deconstructed and
48:26 reconstructed it and he he gave us all
48:28 these specifics of the neural network
48:30 and that's amazing so uh because it's
48:32 going to be very helpful for our project
48:33 so knowing the in and outs you know the
48:36 very specifics of machine learning or
48:38 the implementation of side of things
48:41 can be useful for instance in this
48:43 specific
48:44 um
48:45 aspect
48:47 uh but on this kind of things I do right
48:51 now which I'm more of uh managing
48:54 role essentially because I I also have
48:58 to do some technical stuff but honestly
48:59 much less than I was expecting
49:01 that is not so important because I'm
49:04 working with people who already know how
49:05 to do so so
49:07 um it all depends I think uh on what you
49:11 want to do and what you are being hired
49:13 for so sometimes
49:16 I think that it's a very hard part of
49:17 this is sometimes you are not exactly
49:20 quite sure what you're being hired for
49:21 or what the person who's interviewing
49:22 with you expects from you and that can
49:25 be a handicap uh but but yeah
49:28 um it can be useful to know so
49:32 yeah so I actually wanted to talk to
49:34 what you do at work right now but we
49:37 have so many questions so okay um we can
49:40 just go with the questions so the
49:42 question we have uh the most aborted one
49:45 is how to prepare for a technical for
49:48 technical questions in an interview
49:49 other than portfolio projects
49:52 taking notes or uh I mean honestly
49:55 whatever works for you man I think that
49:59 um sorry I think I saturated the mic um
50:02 I think that
50:04 I mean preparing for technical questions
50:05 such up
50:07 um hard thing to do because you cannot
50:09 know what you're going to be asked for
50:10 unless you know what you're being hired
50:12 for right so if I mean for instance if
50:15 your company the company that's going to
50:16 hire you Works in NLP project then it
50:18 makes sense to study specifically NLP
50:22 right on what's NLP what does entail
50:24 what kind of tasks you solve how they
50:25 approach those tasks whatever
50:28 um but
50:29 um but sometimes you don't really know
50:32 what to do so it all depends what kind
50:34 of technique you are most comfortable
50:36 with when starting taking notes from
50:38 videos that's fine reading your past
50:40 notes which is what I did
50:42 um uh doing some exercises building up
50:44 your portfolio is also good because uh
50:46 not only you have something to show but
50:48 you are also uh you those skills are
50:51 being ingrained into your brain when you
50:53 carry out those projects so it depends
50:55 on how you want to approach those I mean
50:57 whatever works for you honestly I think
50:59 and even though they didn't specifically
51:01 ask you about these projects it was
51:04 still useful for you to master these
51:06 skills right right
51:07 but I guess it's uh
51:10 it's pretty unusual maybe they just
51:12 didn't ask you about them right but they
51:14 did look at because everything was
51:16 public everything is public it's on here
51:18 GitHub maybe they just went through this
51:19 yeah everything's nice yeah
51:22 um they did ask me some I mean for for
51:24 the company I work for when the actually
51:26 the two people who hired me are not
51:28 working for the company anymore which is
51:29 kind of funny but
51:31 um but I did I was asked a few technical
51:33 questions they were just very simple
51:35 like if you have this kind of task how
51:37 would you solve it and I would do a very
51:39 high level approach to the task you know
51:41 that sort of thing but nothing super
51:43 specific and there were no coding
51:44 exercises in this particular instance
51:46 in those previous processes I had to
51:48 turn in code so you know it all depends
51:53 can you tell us how your typical work
51:56 day looks like
51:58 sure I I read email a bit of it and I
52:02 also check out teams when when you know
52:05 when my computer decides to run it
52:07 because holy craft uh teams is such a
52:09 hug uh but
52:12 um you're on my credit uh I well right
52:14 now I'm a Mac but my work computer is a
52:17 PC which it's Windows yes and it doesn't
52:20 run Microsoft teams it I mean it only
52:23 has it only had only eight gigs of RAM
52:27 uh which I thought was not enough and
52:29 then I recently got upgraded to 24 gigs
52:31 of RAM which is amazing and and right
52:33 now I think I can finally run teams
52:35 properly
52:36 but yeah
52:38 um but usually today right now is I'm in
52:41 charge of uh a project so what I do is I
52:44 have my
52:46 my
52:47 I've set up a way of managing it I've
52:49 got an Excel sheet I've got also
52:51 Microsoft planner which is a trailer
52:53 like thing that is included with office
52:56 um and it also integrates well with
52:58 steam so it's good because you're in
53:00 your specific team and then you just
53:02 there's a step with the with the tasks
53:04 there which is great and right now
53:06 there's only two of us it's only me and
53:08 some other guys so we divide what we
53:10 want to do and and we we work on it on
53:14 every on we work from home so each one
53:17 of us Works in a specific thing and then
53:19 at the end of the day or halfway through
53:21 the day then we update each other on
53:24 what we've done
53:26 um and that's it then
53:28 for instance we had a back in April May
53:33 that was the the Zenith of the project
53:35 right and I've seen and the the point
53:37 with the most development going on there
53:39 were five of us and each one was coding
53:43 different stuff
53:44 um we were we had to agree on what was
53:47 had to be what had to be done and then
53:49 we had to agree on with with what tasks
53:52 um so that's essentially it I mean it's
53:54 more of a more project management
53:56 project management kind of thing than
53:58 actual machine learning
54:01 but right now because well there's less
54:03 of us right now there's only two people
54:04 and we'll have a third person coming
54:07 soon but not yet so we also have I have
54:09 to do also some more technical stuff but
54:12 that's it and what kind of tech stack do
54:13 you use
54:14 right uh so we are on Azure house
54:18 um well more like our client uh works
54:21 with Azure so we make use of the
54:23 resources of the client and we work uh
54:27 all of our code is in Python we used
54:29 Python and auto Keras which is a library
54:32 which if you don't know you just set up
54:34 a
54:35 you set up your data set you set up a
54:37 task and auto carers will look the best
54:40 model for you so it's like everything
54:42 everything is done for you pretty much
54:44 automatically and then you have you do
54:45 have to fine-tune things uh but
54:48 essentially yeah that's what we did
54:50 then we run those uh scripts those
54:53 Python scripts are being run on a
54:54 databricks cluster and we orchestrate
54:57 those scripts with something called
54:58 Azure data Factory which is like and you
55:02 you design your Dax uh which is um
55:05 essentially you work you create your
55:07 workflows on that Factory and then so
55:10 when something's triggered then it calls
55:12 a specific script which then calls some
55:16 another script and you know that sort of
55:17 stuff and everything is written to
55:20 um SQL database
55:22 SQL database sorry I'm I'm used to
55:24 saying the the spelling it's it's
55:26 supposed to be SQL in English
55:28 is it is it cool yeah I think both work
55:30 right I think I'm not sure yeah I hear
55:33 both options okay then whatever SQL SQL
55:37 whatever yeah Microsoft SQL database on
55:40 Azure that's where it's all the data is
55:43 being kept
55:46 is that is that kind of is a stack that
55:48 uh the developers were more familiar
55:49 with so that's what we went with because
55:51 we the project was supposed to be
55:53 delivered in September and we had to
55:55 deliver our first prototype in June
55:58 uh which was a shock uh so we had to
56:00 speed up the process by three months and
56:02 right now we're extending it and
56:05 you know we're adding more new stuff
56:07 but yeah it's been a challenge
56:10 okay and uh for somebody who wants to go
56:13 through the same process as you somebody
56:16 who is uh coming not from necessarily
56:19 from very technical background I don't
56:21 know how much technical your background
56:23 was uh but I guess
56:27 forgive me if I'm wrong with my
56:30 interpretation of what you did didn't
56:32 require a lot of technical expertise
56:35 sorry
56:36 um I don't mean it did require some but
56:38 yeah I know I know what you mean yeah
56:40 yeah I mean
56:41 yeah please go ahead yeah so the
56:44 question is like
56:45 somebody
56:46 for somebody who wants to follow your
56:48 path maybe not necessarily like even
56:50 from a less technical background or more
56:52 technical background
56:53 how do they do this what would your
56:55 recommendation be in this case
56:58 I mean would you suggest them to just
57:00 leave and you know spend two years being
57:02 unemployed uh take courses I mean that's
57:05 what worked for me that's what works for
57:07 me but it all depends on what works for
57:09 you uh I mean I do have a technical
57:12 background because I want to you know I
57:13 did Computer Engineering and science
57:15 whatever I studied that even though uh
57:18 my actual work was not as technical I
57:21 did have to though to know some stuff
57:23 because I had to
57:25 um read all these Google Documents which
57:27 explain what the homologation process
57:29 was like and what the requirements were
57:31 so we I had to know which kind what kind
57:32 of modifications were not supposed to be
57:34 done on the phone in order to uh pass
57:37 those tests so it did require some
57:39 knowledge about you know how Android is
57:42 layered and that sort of stuff but
57:46 but yeah I don't believe that you need a
57:49 technical background in order to work in
57:51 this field but it helps a lot especially
57:53 if you want to
57:55 um I mean it all depends on what kind of
57:57 role you want to do but so if you want
58:00 to be an actual data scientist like work
58:02 in a you know in in most of the high
58:04 level of stuff like experimenting with
58:06 models and such it helps a lot to have a
58:08 mathematical background because that's
58:10 all very technical I'm all very
58:13 theoretical in a way and there's lots of
58:15 research going on and lots of new stuff
58:17 are is coming up all the time so it
58:19 really helps a lot if you have a
58:20 mathematical background there and
58:21 actually in my company uh my colleague
58:24 right now he's a mathematics
58:25 mathematician by by you know he studied
58:27 mathematics and there are quite a bit of
58:30 mathematics in the company however on
58:33 the other side
58:35 if you want to do the actual that
58:36 engineering part
58:37 if you want to actually like you want to
58:40 be very good at spark or you want to be
58:42 very good at Kafka or you want to be
58:44 very good at
58:45 um any of the tools like that are being
58:48 used in
58:49 in machine learning workflows then you
58:52 don't need such a technical background
58:53 because it's all about knowing the tool
58:56 and learning how to use it so you I
58:58 believe that you can come from any
58:59 particular background and work on that
59:01 however you I mean it works it helps if
59:03 you have some technical background
59:05 because then you already know all the
59:07 high Concepts and when you have to
59:09 change to another tool sure you have to
59:12 learn new stuff but it won't come in a
59:14 weird manner to you right it's like if
59:17 you know if you are learning Docker and
59:19 and so yeah you can use Docker fine and
59:22 oh now I have to use kubernetes okay
59:23 then I'm learning kubernetes but um
59:27 if you know what a Linux kernel is and
59:29 how it relates to the um to the um to
59:31 the underlying virtualization or
59:33 sandboxing parts of stuff it helps to
59:36 understand why some things works the way
59:38 work the way they do
59:40 but they're not entirely necessary so on
59:44 that part of things I think that you
59:45 don't need a technical background for it
59:46 but
59:48 um yeah so it depends on what you want
59:50 to do the way I understood you so you
59:52 already knew how to program right this
59:54 is something you started in uh your
59:57 computer university university
