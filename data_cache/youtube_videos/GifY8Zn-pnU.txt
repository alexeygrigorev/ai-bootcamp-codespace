1:23 yes so this week we'll talk about
1:26 continuous learning in data
1:28 science and we have we have a special
1:30 guest today Isabella Isabella is a
1:32 machine learning engineer and data
1:34 scientist with three years of Hands-On
1:36 AI development experience she has
1:38 previous experience in computational
1:39 research expertise and she contributes
1:42 to open source projects and run a
1:44 newsletter dedicated to showcasing
1:46 women's accomplishment in data science
1:48 Welcome to our interview thank you so
1:50 much really happy to be here so the
1:53 questions for today's interview are
1:55 prepared by Johanna Bayer as always
1:57 thank you joh Hanna for your
1:58 help and before we start um Isabella
2:02 let's start with your background can you
2:03 tell tell us about your career Journey
2:05 so far okay so I come from a somewhat
2:09 unusual
2:11 background I'm I have a my first degree
2:14 is a bachelor in biological science and
2:17 I kind of knew I wanted to be a
2:21 bioinformatician from the start and I
2:23 was very lucky that I was in the uni
2:25 that let me Peck and choose courses from
2:26 other disciplines so what I would do
2:29 essentially is I would go to the
2:30 computer science department and I would
2:32 ask can I enroll in your course so I
2:35 took like all the standard computer
2:37 science classes like data structor
2:39 algorithms and like object artive
2:43 programming um from that I did a
2:46 master's degree in
2:49 bioinformatics and I was co-opted for
2:53 machine learning and I sort of never
2:55 left like right about the time I started
2:57 my master degree it was the beginning of
3:00 the boom of machine learning and then I
3:02 jump in and my entire career changed
3:05 because of that because then I really
3:06 like it and I never really
3:09 left so was it like a coincidence what
3:12 you say sorry was it like a likey
3:15 coincidence like you weren't actively
3:17 looking for a career in machine learning
3:19 it just happened right no no no I wasn't
3:21 active learning for career in machine
3:23 learning I I always I like data but I
3:26 thought I would be more like a data
3:28 engineer than I would be a machine
3:30 learning and kind of like statistics was
3:33 my getaway drug into machine learning
3:35 cuz like once you understand like
3:37 statistics and distributions then you
3:39 stand like linear modeling and then you
3:41 understand functions and before you know
3:42 you're were like yes Transformers they
3:45 look cool and it kind of just happened
3:47 for me but I'm really happy it happened
3:50 that way I think if I was starting
3:52 machine learning because I was really
3:54 passionate about AI it would be a lot
3:55 more
3:56 overwhelming so I was kind of just in
3:58 the right place in the right time and
4:00 completely fell in love with it mhm
4:03 where did you study um my B my
4:07 bachelor's degree was in um Brazil in a
4:10 university called M
4:13 feder and then I got my master's degree
4:16 in France in the University of Merc in
4:19 the south of France so are you from
4:22 Brazil originally yeah yeah I was from
4:26 last name does not sound very French
4:28 right no I'm not very French at all I've
4:31 been living here now for about four
4:35 years
4:37 so you speak French I do speak French
4:40 uhuh so you learned it before going to
4:42 France yeah yeah I learned before going
4:44 to France I wouldn't that to move to
4:46 France without speaking any french it's
4:48 very hard especially if it's not Paris
4:50 right so we talked about living in
4:52 France for a bit so I lived in a small
4:54 City and with just English is very hard
4:57 to survive there well I used to live in
5:00 Merc and Mer is different because it's
5:02 so touristic like you would hear people
5:05 speaking Arabic and English and German
5:08 on the street especially in summer in
5:11 summer it was it was a bit crazy I
5:14 remember like when they're boat stock
5:16 and they are full of like Cruisers and
5:18 tourists you couldn't find water in the
5:20 supermarket because the city cannot
5:22 observe all the tourists it's it's a
5:24 very different experience but like
5:27 around and to get especially to get
5:28 administrative work done you really need
5:30 to speak I would say Spanish but you
5:33 really need to speak
5:34 French okay and um also you didn't
5:38 mention but we did some research well
5:40 johana did some research she looked at
5:42 your LinkedIn profile and saw that you
5:44 did quite a few internships while
5:48 studying and one of them was indria and
5:50 indria is quite well known well I know
5:53 them because this is where psych learn
5:55 started but I know that they do much
5:57 much more than just you know psych learn
6:00 so what did you work on there at indria
6:03 okay so and what is indria so India is a
6:07 French Research Institute I think the
6:09 name is like National Institute of
6:12 research and automation research
6:15 intelligence and Automation and then I
6:17 remember they tell them automation kind
6:19 of just means AI now like they gave this
6:21 name ages and ages ago uh before I did
6:25 this internship I I didn't even knew
6:28 inia was the people who who got who
6:30 maintained sacred land I learned like a
6:33 week before started the internship and I
6:34 was like oh my God I'm in a big place of
6:37 much pressure but I got this internship
6:40 because in my Master's Degree there was
6:42 a career development module and they
6:45 would invite people to come and talk
6:47 about their career paths and especially
6:49 because when you do like something
6:51 that's interdisciplinary it's quite a
6:53 challenge then to find your your footing
6:56 after and the researcher was Sebastian
6:59 he came and he was a mathematician by
7:01 training and he did apply things
7:05 into sort of like biomarkers and cancer
7:08 research so he came he gave his
7:10 presentation and I think two weeks later
7:12 I wrote to him I was like I really like
7:14 your research I I had already I did my
7:17 bachelor thesis on biomarkers and I was
7:20 like do you have a project that I could
7:22 work on could I possibly do an
7:24 internship and he said yes and then I
7:27 worked with them I think for two months
7:30 on creating models to predict patient
7:34 response in cancer so essentially it's
7:37 like a
7:38 um oh my God I'm not going to remember
7:41 but it's a type of lung cancer a
7:43 specific type of lung cancer that they
7:44 wanted to protective patient would
7:46 respond to immunotherapy from just like
7:49 a a simple blood drone and it was really
7:52 super cool because um the team had
7:56 like we were at least five and would all
7:59 sit in this open space so like I would
8:02 be coding in my computer and I would
8:03 have a question and I could just ask the
8:06 question to the team and I would have an
8:07 enter right it was really super super
8:10 enriching a super cool experience and I
8:12 am still friends with some of the people
8:14 I I met uh when I was working there and
8:16 it was really awesome so I recommend I
8:19 think they're super
8:20 cool is it in Paris or where is it no uh
8:24 this one it was the only team in Mars
8:27 like they had just moved to marsill when
8:29 I I did the intership with them but they
8:32 were originally from B which is the on
8:35 the
8:36 coast I have no idea where it
8:40 is like friends is like um an exagon uh
8:45 like if it's think like this that Vero
8:47 is in this corner of the exagon uhuh I I
8:52 of course know the name I have heard the
8:54 name I just yeah even though I lived in
8:57 France for a bit but yeah yeah I know
9:00 the places
9:05 that okay and uh does indria do anything
9:11 except machine learning or is just fully
9:13 focused on ML and Ai and this kind of
9:16 stuff no I think they do I think they do
9:18 do other stuff more like statistical
9:20 fundamental research I think they just
9:22 got to be really well known from Ai and
9:25 machine learning because they they're
9:27 really the Forefront of it right now
9:30 even the I think the I never remember if
9:32 it's betting or splitting but that was
9:35 also co-published by them so and also
9:38 France in general the government has
9:40 been buring a lot of money into Ai and
9:43 Innovation so I think they profit from
9:46 that quite
9:47 directly different centers yeah and uh
9:52 so like when I think about France uh
9:56 recently uh I know it as a kind of
10:00 Center for AI CU mistal is from there so
10:04 and since I live in Germany I think like
10:06 okay why there are not so many German
10:08 companies that do that no I think uh
10:11 mcon was really pushing like yes
10:14 everybody we're going to do AI we're
10:15 going to be great at it but there quite
10:17 a few companies there mol um there's jar
10:20 too which is for
10:22 evaluating rag systems or LMS in general
10:25 it's also Bas in Paris hugging face MH
10:29 yeah right so Paris is it's becoming
10:32 quite of a a hub yeah okay and um right
10:37 now uh if we open your
10:40 LinkedIn and it says that you're a
10:42 machine learning engineer but
10:44 self-employed so what what do you do
10:46 what are you working on so I'm working
10:47 full-time as a freelancer right now um I
10:50 cannot say the company I'm working for I
10:52 would have to get permission from them
10:53 to do it I have NDA in place but I am
10:57 building um rag um more specifically
11:00 like graph rag system and trying to
11:03 automate the process of generating um
11:05 knowledge
11:06 crafts for a company with direct um
11:10 applications into Insurance systems so
11:12 it's quite a quite a change from what I
11:15 did in the past but it has been quite
11:19 quite nice I've been wanting to
11:21 freelance full-time for a while so I
11:23 took it opportunity when it
11:25 arrived so you've been doing this as I
11:28 for like three months right so it's
11:30 pretty recent yeah yeah but before that
11:33 I was also freelancing but more as a
11:35 data scientist ah okay so basically
11:38 you've been freelancer for freelancing a
11:40 freelancer for quite some time except
11:42 now you changed your profile a little
11:44 right so before you dat scientist what
11:47 did you do before so before this um I
11:50 did a quite of different things my last
11:52 freelance before this was in in a
11:56 company where we were taking um
11:58 essentially open source data from like
12:01 GE reference systems and we were
12:03 aggregating and processing them
12:05 sometimes a little bit of machine
12:06 learning sometimes it was more based on
12:10 on what it was inside like a rule based
12:13 classical database merging system um to
12:16 get maps out of a specific region that
12:20 they were interested in so this was very
12:23 data Focus different than being more
12:26 model Focus
12:29 so did you start as a
12:31 freelancer immediately after no no no I
12:34 worked in first I worked in a little bit
12:36 of a research based position I wanted to
12:40 to get more research experience and see
12:43 how that goes and it was nice but I
12:47 don't think research like fully was what
12:50 I expecting it to be it's very like it's
12:53 super cool when you see the papers out
12:55 and you see the result but on a day
12:57 today I felt like I was
12:59 I had too much of an engineering and I
13:02 wanted to get a product done and I
13:03 wanted to get you know that really the
13:07 final product out like I realize it
13:09 makes me anxious when I'm working with
13:11 something that does not have a clear
13:13 deliverable and I don't have like a a
13:16 clear set of what it's like so I kind of
13:18 change for freelancing where I could I
13:21 could have that but also all as a
13:23 freelancer I think I am too much of a of
13:26 a researcher in mind so I'm in the
13:28 middle of the that's
13:31 you
13:33 myos did you do some sort of PhD uh a
13:37 PhD was were you a PhD student when you
13:39 were working as a researcher or was just
13:42 a work no I started as a PhD student and
13:46 decided it was just not for me okay so
13:49 basically um you were doing a PhD you
13:52 decided it's not for you and then you
13:54 thought okay I want to to do to go to
13:56 the
13:57 industry and and you started as a
14:00 freelancer in Industry so why didn't you
14:03 just you know join a company as a
14:07 full-time employee why did you decide to
14:09 be a freelancer because I wasn't sure
14:12 what I wanted to do in the first place
14:14 like I I had an idea but I wanted to
14:18 experiment things and I think like as a
14:20 freelancer like you change products
14:22 quite often you get to meet new people
14:25 you see how different companies work and
14:28 that was the really like what sold it
14:30 for me like the ability to see more see
14:32 how things work get her hands-on
14:35 experience with different
14:39 things CU to me it looks maybe I'm wrong
14:42 but to me it looks like freelancing is
14:45 more difficult in the sense that like
14:46 you need to constantly look for clients
14:49 you
14:51 also usually companies expect that you
14:54 have a certain level of experience when
14:55 they hire Freelancers uh so to me it
14:58 looks like getting a full-time job as a
15:00 usual employee is easier than a
15:03 freelancer so freelancing is like the
15:05 doing it the kind of hard
15:07 way uh yet you decided to to do a
15:10 Freelancers first so many people
15:12 actually have problems with uh finding
15:15 just a job after Academia right it's not
15:19 that easy uh but you decided to kind of
15:22 skip the step to jump over finding like
15:25 the usual full-time employment and just
15:26 went directly to freelancing so that's
15:29 pretty interesting yeah it was a little
15:31 bit um I I don't well it is a bit
15:34 stressful to be a freelancer sometimes
15:36 you do have to look for clients you do
15:38 have to look for offers you have to
15:40 contact people but I feel like it's not
15:46 as difficult as people make it out to be
15:50 I think it's just a different skill set
15:53 I think like also looking for a job can
15:55 be quite hard and quite of a a
15:57 challenging thing but I think it's um I
16:01 think eventually I want to have like a
16:03 full-time job in a company where I do
16:05 that but when I have a more like more
16:08 experience and more more of a more of a
16:12 fill like more of a hands-on experience
16:15 in the sense that I don't know I I think
16:18 if you like different projects if you
16:20 are curious about things work being a
16:22 freelancer is like a good option it
16:26 allows you to try different things to
16:28 see different topics and then I think
16:31 the nice thing about being a freelancer
16:33 too is that you're very much hired based
16:35 on what you can immediately offer a
16:37 company so if you're like learning new
16:40 things it can be quite of a good a good
16:44 job like a good
16:45 career CU you you can stay like if
16:48 you're like what is the latest
16:50 technology you can you have enough time
16:52 as a freelancer to pick that up on your
16:54 own and see how it goes and then
16:55 immediately apply that to a project
16:58 that's interesting how did you go about
17:00 finding your first client like okay you
17:03 you were doing a PhD you understood that
17:05 it's not for you and then you decide
17:07 okay I want to do a freelance to be a
17:08 freelancer I want to try different
17:10 things so how did you get your first
17:12 client so I quit my PhD when I had
17:16 enough um I quit it and then I was like
17:19 I'm going to look for a job or I'm going
17:22 to see if I can freelance so I post my
17:24 CV in some places and I was going to
17:28 move like I was going to relocate from
17:30 where I was in meray to to Leon
17:33 anyway so I just post my CVS and one day
17:38 I remember because I was surprisingly I
17:40 was at the supermarket and then like I
17:42 got a call from somebody saying oh we
17:44 looking for a freelance this is what we
17:46 want um could you like would you be
17:48 interested in this job and I was like
17:51 yes and uh week later I had my first
17:54 client it was really like everything
17:55 happened super fast mhm okay
18:00 so that's it yeah yeah there's no
18:02 magical story no side hustle I just
18:04 posted my CV everywhere um optimize my
18:08 lung profile and that was kind of it I I
18:12 kind
18:13 of I wish I had a more interesting story
18:16 but really it was just that I mean it's
18:19 kind of actually good in a sense that uh
18:23 it doesn't have to be complicated
18:25 right yeah I think it really also also
18:29 had a good profile right yeah I think I
18:32 I was also a little bit lucky because I
18:35 was always very much involved with
18:37 projects outside of
18:40 Academia so I actually had to like the
18:43 skills for this job because I was part
18:45 of another project which was a AI for
18:48 good project coordinated by OA which was
18:51 very much based on like Geor reference
18:54 Technologies and geospatial libraries so
18:58 when they call me like yeah I know how
18:59 to do that because I was involved with
19:01 this project where we did something
19:03 similar and the same thing for like the
19:05 machine learning part I got involved
19:07 into a couple of open sources projects
19:09 because I wanted to have that more
19:11 machine learning
19:12 Focus um experience as opposed to like a
19:16 data a data science or a full-time data
19:19 scientist and when like the opport like
19:22 when the time come when I had a client
19:24 who was looking for that profile I had
19:25 the skills that they needed for it MH so
19:28 it was it was a little bit of luck and a
19:31 little bit of effort on my side to to to
19:34 pick up maybe not a little bit of effort
19:36 because it sounds like you did quite a
19:38 lot to actually like I
19:41 mean taking part in an AI for good
19:44 project and then learning something
19:46 there and doing something there is quite
19:50 some effort yeah I mean you were also
19:53 studying you were working in Academia uh
19:55 doing a PhD you had to do a lot of other
19:58 things and then finding time and
20:00 motivation to do an extra thing
20:02 is quite some effort right it is but I
20:07 don't know I think open source can be so
20:09 fun that it doesn't really feel like um
20:13 you're putting as much effort okay
20:17 especially like um some projects people
20:19 are so nice and people are so motivating
20:22 and everybody is really like passionate
20:24 about what they do that you just wake up
20:26 or you just get home to work in New Y
20:28 excited to do that or at least I get I
20:31 get excited when I have to like do
20:33 something and I know I will talk to the
20:35 people who are invested in this project
20:37 we're really passionate so I think it's
20:39 a lot easier easier to work in those
20:42 circumstances because you're surrounded
20:44 by motivated people you all share kind
20:46 of the same vision you're learning
20:48 something new and it's kind of um a
20:51 pressure-free environment too if you are
20:53 learning skills in like an academic
20:55 setting or in a boot camp you have like
20:58 very high that lines very high
21:00 expectations quite often in open tourus
21:02 is a lot of like playtime right you have
21:05 a model you have an idea and you just
21:07 want to play and see what comes out of
21:09 it and I end up learning quite a lot
21:12 when I have that space and people to
21:14 share with and so forth can you tell us
21:17 more about these open source projects
21:19 what are those and how do you find them
21:22 so any like I wish again I wish I had a
21:25 great story to tell but the first one
21:27 that I got truly TR deeply involved was
21:30 the community course from hugging face
21:33 it was the computer vision Community
21:35 course and the story of it it was I was
21:38 on Discord and I'm a bit of a
21:40 chronically online person I was just on
21:43 hugging face Discord and I saw people
21:45 talking about this community
21:47 project MH and then I saw somebody
21:51 saying oh we created a channel for it MH
21:54 and I joined the channel and on the
21:56 channel somebody had okay so we have the
21:59 stable of contents and we have a
22:00 spreadsheet if you want to contribute
22:02 sign to the spreadsheet I signed to the
22:05 spreadsheet and then I spend the next
22:07 three months of my life talking about
22:10 this all the time and just like coming
22:12 home after work and being like yes let's
22:15 write things about computer vision let's
22:17 review PRS and I made great friends on
22:20 the course like
22:21 um like friends that I would have not
22:24 made otherwise and then the AI for good
22:28 project happened because somebody on
22:30 this was being part of the project and
22:32 they were like oh I'm doing this project
22:35 do you want to join and I was like sure
22:37 and then I did that project and then I
22:39 met other people in that project who
22:40 were doing other things and then before
22:43 I realized I was doing all this projects
22:45 that I thought it was super interesting
22:47 because once you know people then they
22:49 have ideas and they're like oh I have
22:51 this idea do you have time and then it
22:53 comes from there and I I guess it's a
22:56 little bit weird but I think this is
22:59 kind of like the side effect when people
23:01 say you should
23:02 Network it's because uh once you find a
23:05 group of people who share the same
23:07 person passion and have the same ideas
23:10 then you you become aware of what's
23:12 going on and people have like oh I want
23:14 to try this and you're were like sure I
23:16 have three hours do you what you want to
23:18 do with it and things just really took
23:21 it from there like not a grand story
23:24 just I wanted to do something with open
23:26 source for quite a while and I didn't
23:28 know what to to start I saw somebody
23:30 organizing something and then I jumped
23:32 on it yeah so for me the main takeaways
23:35 um like a summary of what you said is
23:38 you hang out in communities you
23:40 just and you're being open to uh two
23:45 opportunities so you just see okay like
23:47 something is going on let me take a look
23:49 and then you see that it resonates with
23:50 you and you jump on this and you take
23:52 part yeah exactly and it's really not
23:58 it's very scary when you never done it
24:01 but once you're done for the first time
24:02 you see okay like this is this is okay I
24:05 can handle this especially when it's a
24:08 community project um so the scariest
24:12 part is uh like when you start something
24:14 new is like knowing where to start but
24:16 when you work with somebody else it's
24:18 kind of easier to have a plan and to
24:20 know your next step and once you know
24:22 your next step if you do your next step
24:24 then it's kind of clear what the next
24:25 step is and then step by step you kind
24:27 of you finish the thing true and also
24:31 like in community like people naturally
24:34 gravitate towards certain roles like
24:36 certain people naturally become like the
24:38 editors and filtering out ideas and some
24:41 people naturally become like the
24:43 deadliner and personally I am not too
24:46 good to keep tracking of a deadline
24:48 outside of work so I always appreciate
24:49 when there's somebody that's coming like
24:51 okay but we have to get this on by next
24:53 week it's like when do we need to get
24:54 this on by next week it's really cool
24:57 because you see really how different
24:58 people and how different ways of working
25:00 can really make a project come together
25:03 MH so this community course on hgen face
25:07 was it Discord right was it you said it
25:10 was about computer vision right mhm so
25:13 what exactly did you do there so just
25:17 one of the modules or yeah I work mostly
25:20 on the first module which is like what
25:22 is computer vision what is image
25:25 processing um how the computers even see
25:28 Imes and like what are the classical
25:30 techniques that happened and then after
25:34 that I sort of became a reviewer for the
25:38 course so I review quite a lot of the
25:40 other units mostly because the way that
25:43 the course was structured like once
25:45 everybody was done everybody made the PO
25:47 request and then it became like okay we
25:49 have 30 PO requests to review like who
25:51 is
25:52 available and then I also contributed to
25:54 like some parts of like introduction to
25:57 what is transfer learning
25:59 and so forth but it was really based on
26:02 by the time I joined quite a a lot of
26:04 the fancy topics were taken and the
26:06 introductory topics were quite were
26:09 quite free so I was like okay I can take
26:11 the introductory top like I can work
26:14 with
26:15 this and it was and how how much
26:18 computer vision experience did you have
26:19 back then when I was working in in
26:22 Academia like my last internship in my
26:25 master's degree in the beginning of my
26:27 academic work were both in computer
26:30 vision so I was quite quite familiar
26:33 with
26:34 him I'm also curious um like in order to
26:37 teach something or in order to take part
26:39 in a community course like that how much
26:41 how deep your knowledge should
26:43 be so that you don't feel like a I don't
26:46 know an
26:48 imposter yeah I think that's a good
26:50 question like I was very comfortable in
26:52 the topics that I was working on but
26:54 there were definitely like people who
26:56 were more beginners than me
26:58 and I think they did a great job because
27:00 what they what they did sometimes is
27:02 like oh I don't really understand it
27:04 what do you think about it and do you
27:06 have a paper I could read or do you have
27:08 a book that I would recommend so even if
27:11 they were not experts in those topics
27:13 they just put in the work to research
27:15 about it and since there was always
27:16 somebody who knew more about the topic
27:19 at hand it was really like easy to guide
27:21 each other to see like what to do and
27:24 like what was right and what was wrong
27:26 and because there was also like people
27:28 reviewing the blue requests you could
27:29 catch um a lot of like maybe mistakes or
27:32 things that weren't so clear so in the
27:35 end I think maybe not all topics are
27:38 beginner friendly but definitely they
27:41 even in in complex projects I think
27:44 there's always ATT test this more
27:45 beginner friendly MH and also like let's
27:49 say you know the topic uh you you know
27:51 computer vision CU you did some projects
27:54 in computer vision you're not a beginner
27:57 and maybe some things they seem obvious
28:00 to you and then you don't much time
28:04 explaining them but when somebody is
28:06 like uh has a fresh perspective on
28:08 things they don't necessarily have your
28:10 experience they look at the your content
28:14 and say okay like I don't understand how
28:16 did you jump from this point to this
28:17 point yeah honestly that's something
28:20 that I really like about teaching
28:22 because like when you do something on a
28:23 daily basis you kind of forget that that
28:26 has no meaning for people in real life
28:29 whatsoever and then like people like ask
28:32 you this question and you're like oh I
28:34 see so like that's not common knowledge
28:37 and then you have to like Circle back
28:38 and try to explain it with like more
28:40 care and also in a way this just more
28:42 understandable too like machine learning
28:46 is one of those fields that there are so
28:48 many words that mean the same thing and
28:51 there are so many complicated ways to
28:52 say things that sometimes are not that
28:55 complicated so that's I think is really
28:58 important especially if you are starting
29:00 in the field MH and um so let's say I
29:04 want to look to find a project like you
29:07 did to take part in an open source
29:09 project it could be developing a course
29:12 or maybe contributing to something I
29:16 don't know to do some open source
29:18 project uh some other open source
29:20 project where would you suggest to look
29:22 for these projects in which places like
29:25 could it be just random communities uh
29:27 or there are specific places where you
29:30 can be to find them my okay so first if
29:35 you use a specific model that's open
29:38 source or a library that's open source
29:40 likely they either have a slack or
29:42 Discord so probably a good place to
29:45 start is joint there and just see what
29:47 people are doing see what developers are
29:50 saying see when things are being
29:52 released and then also check the issues
29:55 the tab of the Ines on GitHub quite
29:58 often there are some issues that are
30:00 easy to fix or not so easy to fix or
30:04 like when you are using a library if
30:06 you're using it pretty regularly you
30:08 spot things that are
30:11 not not optimal you can also open
30:14 yourself a issue or think about yourself
30:17 how to to do it I think as long as you
30:20 are really nice about it and really open
30:26 things work out fine another thing that
30:28 I think could be cool is sometimes when
30:31 you are in the documentation they
30:34 explicitly say contribute to this or
30:37 contribute to the documentation or
30:39 something like that and that's also a
30:41 good place to start because everybody
30:43 kind of wants to contribute to open
30:45 source and nobody wants to write
30:47 documentation so if you if you're
30:49 willing to start there and see how it
30:51 goes see how it feels I think that's a
30:52 good place to
30:54 start and then on the community side of
30:57 things
30:58 I think uh oina it's om mde n a is a
31:03 good place to start they also they have
31:06 like this local tractors that they
31:07 organize where you can get like hands-on
31:10 experience if a machine learning project
31:12 and it's very low stakes like the
31:15 there's no pressure and training like
31:18 typically is included in in this courses
31:21 which means like somebody separated a
31:23 couple of tripure notebooks that
31:25 everybody will review together and you
31:27 can always um take something from that
31:29 so I think those are the two main main
31:33 places to
31:35 start and while talking with you so when
31:38 I hear contribute to open source to me
31:41 the first thing that comes to mind the
31:43 first idea and or like the way I see it
31:46 is like there are libraries like sakit
31:48 learn Panda sampai and when somebody
31:50 says hey you can contribute to open
31:52 source uh what I have in mind is okay
31:55 there is Psy could learn there are some
31:56 issues and I go and and fix this issue
31:59 but these are tools but
32:01 now when we talked about this and you
32:05 mentioned working on open source
32:06 projects so I think these are different
32:10 sorts of Open Source projects so it's
32:13 not like you're working on a tool but
32:15 rather you use this tool to solve some
32:17 other problem exactly because you can
32:19 also yeah there are dimensions to open
32:21 source right they're open source code
32:23 they're open source data they're open
32:25 source tools and I think like it's cool
32:27 to contribute to open source tools but I
32:29 think it's also the most overwhelming
32:31 place to start yeah because like if you
32:34 go like to numai and try to see the
32:36 structure of the code there are layers
32:38 and layers and layers of it or like when
32:41 you when you have a problem with napai
32:43 and it go to their issues and you see
32:44 the issues there's probably somebody
32:46 who's already tagged on that and already
32:47 developing on that that that's not to
32:50 say that you cannot contribute right but
32:52 I think like the smaller libraries they
32:54 are usually a more welcoming place to
32:56 start and and honestly open source data
32:59 it's also I think overlooked a lot of
33:02 time like if you can get a fully like
33:06 open source project with open source
33:08 code open source library and a final
33:10 product I think that's a like really
33:13 adds value to that and you also
33:15 mentioned the course Community course at
33:17 henf face um I assume it was also like
33:21 open source F yeah yeah fully open which
33:24 is uh very close to me because this is
33:26 how we do courses in Club so we use
33:29 GitHub and like everyone can contribute
33:32 and while it's not open source in the
33:34 sense that it's not like a library
33:36 pandas right but it's still open to
33:40 everyone for Learning and for
33:42 contributing yeah yeah makes it cool
33:45 right no yeah it's pretty cool I I like
33:47 it too like I took um I took some of the
33:50 boot camps not entirely just specific
33:52 models that I was interested in and I
33:55 think it's really nice because it's it's
33:57 getting harder and harder to get like
33:59 true good sources of information in tax
34:03 space especially nowadays like I feel if
34:06 you Google something you end up with the
34:09 first five pages is just entries that
34:11 look like they were made by touch BT and
34:13 then things kind of go wrong so when you
34:16 have like somebody who truly made the
34:17 content and thought about it and put
34:19 something together it makes a lot of
34:23 difference okay and when it comes to
34:25 projects we talked about courses but
34:28 this AI forg good you said one of the
34:30 places was uh is Amina and this is where
34:33 you found your project too right or yeah
34:36 yeah that was where I found my project
34:39 and actually like I had a so one of the
34:42 people I met in the first project invite
34:44 me to organize another chapter with her
34:47 so now in December we'll be Co
34:48 organizing a chapter on Green Space
34:51 segmentation in Frankfurt so if people
34:54 are interested they can also come join
34:55 my local chapter I'll be more than helpy
34:58 not going space segmentation yeah Green
35:02 Space segmentation so what does it mean
35:05 essentially like if you have a garden or
35:07 a forest in the city and you have it's
35:10 not like outer space it's more like
35:12 space on Earth space on Earth yes not
35:15 out territory territory territory and
35:18 then you have like there are a couple of
35:20 different satellites the most I think
35:23 the one I'm most familiar with is
35:24 Sentinel 2 which essentially circles
35:27 around the Earth and take pictures for
35:29 free MH and I think for from for
35:32 Frankford there is also High aerial like
35:35 drone high quality images for the area
35:37 and the challenges is from this images
35:40 how how are you able to process them to
35:43 have as a result a segmentation map of
35:46 the city so where are the gardens what
35:48 are the forest what are the green spaces
35:50 that are available can you map this back
35:53 to what is supposed to be your ground
35:54 roof and it's really focused on on that
35:58 and our main idea at the moment is to
36:01 Benchmark different strategies like from
36:03 CNN to more Transformers based SL member
36:07 based approaches and see like which
36:09 truly is the best or well truly is the
36:12 best a bit ambitious but what is that is
36:14 actually
36:15 doable because that's also like I I have
36:18 like um I feel sometimes things perform
36:20 great in in research when you try to use
36:23 it in real life it's just not doable
36:25 because not not everybody has access to
36:27 like the service and if it takes a whole
36:29 day to input like to predict one image
36:32 then H how how much time do you really
36:35 have for like who has the resources to
36:37 really do that so it has that like we
36:40 want to get the green space map out but
36:43 we also want to S out like if somebody
36:45 has to do this for another city like
36:47 what would be the correct way to do it
36:49 or like the best way to do it
36:52 MH as and as As I understood the project
36:55 you did before
36:57 um it had also like something geospatial
37:00 right and when you were looking for your
37:04 first freelance
37:06 job uh actually the the company you
37:09 ended up working for needed the exact
37:12 skills that you developed during this uh
37:15 this project yeah yeah that's exactly
37:17 what happened and maybe that will happen
37:20 again here I don't know maybe my next
37:22 fre L will be exactly like like the
37:25 scenario but I think that's a a really
37:27 good good story like you learn a skill
37:30 in a project hands on and I mean forena
37:34 there's no expectation that you would
37:36 work 20 hours or 15 hours it's really
37:38 like if you have five hours in a week
37:41 just like a half a day or after work for
37:43 two or to three days you just join a
37:47 project and you work with other people
37:48 to try to come up with a solution it's a
37:51 very I think it's a cool way to learn
37:53 new skills and a lot less overwhelming
37:55 if you do like with a team mhm would you
37:59 say that uh it typically happens that
38:01 the skills you pick up uh on such
38:03 projects they are handon Hands-On skills
38:06 that translate to job skills I think so
38:10 first I
38:11 think I think everybody gives the same
38:13 advice when it comes to data science
38:14 like build your portfolio do this do do
38:17 that there are so many ways of doing
38:19 that right exactly there are a lot of
38:21 different ways of doing that but like as
38:23 I grow in my here I realize that people
38:26 are also looking for soft skills right
38:28 when they hire you they just don't want
38:30 to somebody who's great at their job but
38:33 cannot work with anybody else and I
38:35 think when you do projects like this you
38:37 are forced to pick up soft skills
38:39 because if you have 80 people working on
38:42 the same project you have to communicate
38:44 well you have to be able to follow up
38:46 what's going on you have to be able to
38:50 access resources and figure things on
38:52 your own to not be overwhelmed when you
38:55 open Slack and there are 30 messages on
38:58 one single Channel and you don't know
38:59 where to look for I think those it's
39:02 also a great place to develop those
39:03 skills because a lot of I think a lot of
39:06 engineering and data science also the
39:08 mindset that you applied to what you're
39:11 doing and the like if you were alone
39:14 you're working alone I'm sure that you
39:15 are developing very hard skills and very
39:17 technical skills but then maybe you
39:19 missing out on developing a little a
39:21 little bit more of the mindset and also
39:23 when you work alone you don't
39:24 necessarily know uh what are the
39:27 kind of good relevant skills it's true
39:30 and when you work on a project and there
39:32 are people who already have experience
39:34 who got it right you have those people
39:37 in the projects you do you do have
39:40 people who who have more technical
39:42 skills but when you have applied
39:44 projects usually people who work in that
39:46 specific field also show up so for the
39:49 first project we were working with um
39:52 Cass segmentation and there were people
39:54 who just did Cass monitoring for their
39:57 job like their life was to understand
40:00 like where they live and how they model
40:01 and how to segment in them then they
40:04 show up and they're really willing to
40:05 help because that also benefits them at
40:07 their
40:08 job so it's a really cool cool place
40:12 because you really are exposed to a lot
40:13 of different types of people and they
40:16 are probably more in consultant roles
40:18 rather than Hands-On roles right so they
40:20 teach you about their expertise about
40:22 the best way of doing things but then
40:24 you implement exactly okay exactly and
40:28 then also I think it's cool because
40:31 like I I always say this and it seems so
40:34 silly but if you're interested in a job
40:36 the best way to get information for that
40:38 job is ADD somebody on LinkedIn who has
40:40 that job title who works in the way and
40:42 just ask them questions and I that can
40:45 be scary I understand but what scenario
40:48 you just never get a reply and best case
40:52 scenario you get some good free advice
40:54 right and I think with ala what happen
40:57 is because everybody's is meshed into
40:59 the same project that communication and
41:01 that question is more
41:03 free so you can just ask somebody okay
41:06 so like but what do you actually do for
41:09 your job like what does your day today
41:12 look like and I think that's very
41:15 valuable because I think a lot of people
41:17 when they join data science I don't
41:19 think they fully understand the
41:20 difference between positions and
41:23 sometimes those names can be quite
41:24 confusing too like a data scientist in
41:26 company Act won do the same that company
41:28 Y and so forth so funny now if you say
41:31 company X it may mean the actual company
41:34 X oh no not the actual company X just
41:37 imaginary company X right and did you
41:41 say 80 people or 18 like is was it 8 Z 8
41:45 Z okay so that that many people working
41:49 on but super overwhelming yeah
41:57 so many people so it starts with 80 and
42:00 then week by week people fizzle out so I
42:05 think towards the end it was a core of
42:07 about 25 people working on the project
42:10 all the time so the beginning is chaotic
42:12 that things things do settle
42:15 down cuz the the the entrance barrier is
42:19 pretty low right or like what what do
42:21 you actually need to to have or to do in
42:25 order to start working on a project
42:28 time
42:30 okay okay time willingness to learn and
42:33 you need to sign a chart like the chart
42:36 of conduct just saying that you know you
42:38 behave like a normal person you not
42:40 harass people on like and that's it like
42:44 the barrier is pretty low okay and then
42:46 like people realize oh maybe it's not
42:48 for me or I don't have as much time as I
42:51 thought I would have right and then
42:53 instead of 80 at the end like maybe four
42:56 weeks later eight weeks later it's 25
42:59 yeah but all in my experience almost all
43:03 open source projects are like that you
43:05 have a really good turnover rate because
43:08 the again the same club for most of the
43:11 activities we
43:12 have yeah that's just part of doing
43:16 things open source like and in a way I
43:19 think that's
43:20 goodh and you kind of have to plan like
43:22 if you're organizing a project like that
43:24 you have to plan knowing this yeah
43:27 exactly but I I think that's good people
43:30 show like the people are interested in I
43:33 think it's just that when people sign up
43:36 they don't really know what they are
43:37 expecting and then maybe this time they
43:41 won't be able to stay for the full full
43:43 court like for the food project or they
43:46 get overwhelmed but then at least they
43:49 know how to sign up for next time and
43:50 then next time they come they have a
43:52 better expectation so like there is no
43:56 there's no penalty for signing up and 3
43:59 weeks in realizing that's you don't have
44:02 the time for that or like circumstances
44:04 changes at your work and then you won't
44:07 have time anymore but if you learn
44:10 anything from the project I think that's
44:11 already a huge benefit like having
44:13 realistic
44:14 expectations about what you can get out
44:17 of this projects and how you contribute
44:18 I think it's super important so it's not
44:21 like I join and then one week later I
44:24 bounce I decide to leave and that omina
44:27 is forever close to me no no no not at
44:30 all so because then later if I don't
44:33 know half a year later I realized that
44:36 it's more clear to me what I want to do
44:39 and now I do have time and now I have uh
44:41 more realistic expectations of what to
44:44 do there the door is still open right
44:47 yeah yeah exactly the door is still open
44:49 and also what I realized in this
44:50 projects too is some people they really
44:52 want to contribute but what like the
44:55 words that you were talking to them
44:57 they mean nothing to them like if you're
44:59 a complete beginner you join a project
45:01 and somebody goes okay I need to do a
45:03 push to that brench they have no idea
45:06 what you're talking about yeah they they
45:09 don't understand what you're talking
45:10 about so you have to like um you have to
45:14 be clear about that as yourself too so I
45:17 saw a lot of like people saying okay I
45:18 need some handh holding or like I am a
45:21 complete biger what's the first thing
45:23 that I can do about it and sometimes
45:25 like if you have um if you have a good
45:27 team of people they will adjust to your
45:29 level like for example I had I had this
45:32 um student I think he was 17 tops when I
45:35 was in the AA project and he would send
45:37 me messages was like like I want to help
45:39 but I don't know what to do and like
45:41 sometimes I don't have like like the
45:44 people who have more experience
45:45 sometimes they don't have that much time
45:47 and then people who have a lot of time
45:49 don't have a lot of experience classical
45:52 problem yeah so sometimes you can just
45:54 be like okay can you just go to the
45:55 hugging face Hub and find me five models
45:58 that can do this task and just check
46:00 their model cards if they have their
46:01 performance and these people would be
46:03 more than happy to help to to do that
46:05 because they have the time to to go and
46:06 check it and they will learn something
46:08 from it because now they learn like
46:09 where models are how they download a
46:11 model what's a model performance so it's
46:14 it's a really a cool way to collaborate
46:17 with other people and now because we
46:20 have tools like jgpt you can just tell
46:21 them hey like this is what you should
46:23 talk to jgpt about and perhaps learn
46:25 from it yeah true true but also like um
46:29 in my experience because I also teach um
46:33 AI like when people go too deep into CH
46:35 PT they get just get more less because
46:38 CH PT okay if you go to CH PT asking a
46:41 very Advanced question like how do I
46:44 validate a segmentation model Chad PT
46:47 will give you a advanced answer even if
46:50 you ask it to simplified like it's a
46:53 it's a matter of vocabulary and it's a
46:55 matter of understanding like you have an
46:57 answer but you also cannot understand
46:59 the answer that you have yeah I have
47:01 this problem right now so like for
47:03 things I am good at the answers usually
47:06 make sense right CU I have background
47:09 that I need in order to understand the
47:10 answers but for things I'm a UB at like
47:13 for example I'm experimenting with
47:15 Arduino right now which is like hard
47:17 Hardware
47:18 stuff sometimes it gives me pretty
47:20 Advanced answers and then I have no idea
47:22 like how do I apply and then I have to
47:25 like do a step by step
47:28 understanding and then ask a lot of
47:29 questions and then I I have like 10
47:31 chats asking about different things and
47:33 that's overwhelming no yeah I I
47:35 completely understand that that happens
47:37 to me too like sometimes um when I'm
47:40 trying to to do stuff especially I I'm
47:43 I'm on LX and I had a problem with my
47:46 audio and I was like
47:49 okay to like 24.0 how to fix audio issue
47:54 and if you try to ask CH PT like hey
47:56 comes up with terrible advice and you're
47:58 like okay I'm not doing that like where
48:00 is the Forum like where are the TS and
48:02 what they
48:03 doing and then you come across something
48:06 even more creepy at least that was my
48:09 experience with a W yeah it it is but
48:13 it's good I really like it yeah it's
48:16 like uh your life is never boring
48:20 when no no no and you know like um I had
48:24 some friends and in college that we we
48:28 had this joke that when you know nothing
48:29 about Linux you're very responsible and
48:32 when you know a lot about Linux you're
48:34 very responsible when you do just enough
48:38 oh that's when when you have confidence
48:40 enough to try things but you have no
48:43 like way to tell if you're doing
48:45 something good or something bad so you
48:47 to doing a lot of of weird
48:49 things okay so we also wanted to talk
48:52 about your substack so tell us about
48:55 that what do you do what do you on there
48:57 so I have a substack called Data like
49:01 and it's me and Denny and we created
49:03 this substack to talk about women in
49:05 data um data is a Bradfield anything
49:08 from a data analyst to data Vis to
49:11 machine learning and it was um again I
49:15 wish I could have a revelation I have a
49:16 super cool story to tell but honestly uh
49:19 I worked with Den in the past and I was
49:22 like reflecting last year like it was
49:24 around Christmas and I was like like I I
49:27 really wish we could like do something
49:29 like that again because we had a a group
49:32 that we had a weekly meeting about um
49:35 like a just a study group on machine
49:37 learning engineer with women from all
49:40 over the the world and we would just
49:43 find a day in the week and we would
49:45 study a center a certain topic and it
49:47 ran
49:48 for I did this twice and Le in
49:51 Portuguese like focus on Brazil and lot
49:54 more open and together they ran for
49:56 about three and a half months and then
49:59 it becames like too messy to handle that
50:01 because then like if if you do a stud
50:04 group in my experience for more than
50:06 three months everything just collapsed
50:07 because people change schedules and so
50:09 forth Just quite complicated so I wanted
50:12 to do something similar and I was
50:15 thinking about it and I started
50:17 researching about like okay so what are
50:18 the statistics about woman in data like
50:21 what it's like and I came to the
50:24 conclusion that if I wanted to do
50:25 something about the best way would be
50:27 just to tell the stories about the
50:29 people who are working in the
50:31 field so in the the substack we really
50:35 just find people who are working in data
50:37 science and machine learning and we
50:39 interview how they got started what they
50:40 learned in the journey so far like what
50:43 are the aspects that they like about
50:44 their job what is their advice and we've
50:47 been doing this for about 10 months now
50:50 we launch in
50:53 January which uh it's a really cool
50:56 thing think that you do thanks um which
50:58 reminded also me of um an interview I
51:02 think we had one year ago maybe you know
51:04 Sarah from Morocco no no no no but I'll
51:09 Sarah yeah so we had an interview called
51:12 make an impact through volunteering open
51:15 source work which I think is super in
51:17 line with what we talk okay have to find
51:20 SAR and Sarah yeah you should definitely
51:23 talk because um so what she was talking
51:26 about she had a similar
51:28 idea and uh they had a WhatsApp group
51:31 with just women and uh what they did is
51:34 they were looking for hackaton
51:36 to take part and then they would just do
51:39 one hackaton after another and they
51:41 would often win there so yeah you
51:45 definitely need to
51:48 talk super cool I think the the idea for
51:51 the substack is just try to make it more
51:53 accessible because when you do groups
51:55 you have a group and then eventually
51:57 like it's just that and I don't know I
52:00 feel like in a way was uh my way to give
52:04 something back to the community and to
52:06 have more more women voices out there
52:10 can you tell us um about your last few
52:14 issues of substack like what two last
52:16 newsletters what did you talk about
52:18 there so our last newsletter came out
52:21 today it was with Bianca habberman she's
52:23 a researcher in
52:25 bioinformatics and she was like talking
52:27 about how she got started and like the
52:30 projects um I think the most interesting
52:32 part about this interview like she talks
52:34 about how hard it is to take a
52:35 leadership role and how like different
52:38 it is to manage people and different
52:40 projects and she tells a story about a
52:42 tool that she developed um it's a
52:44 specific research too that was very
52:46 impactful for the community and it took
52:49 her 10 years to develop this tool like
52:51 from scratch to the current version that
52:53 she has right now and she talk like
52:55 about how in the beginning people were
52:57 very skeptical and she has to prove that
53:00 like this project and the school really
53:01 worked that you could use them like you
53:04 could do automatically data analysis
53:06 through this tool and then now people
53:08 really like reach out to her about the
53:09 stent like okay can you talk come talk
53:11 about it we're having a workshop which
53:13 would be interesting to to come check in
53:16 in and then the last one was about the
53:20 second to last one was about somebody
53:22 who had started working in fake news
53:26 detection
53:27 and she she was working with I think a
53:30 fellowship if I'm not mistaken from
53:32 Google and she was applying the job that
53:34 she was developing to manage like fake
53:37 news and toxic content in AI communities
53:40 but we had quite a lot different quite
53:43 different profiles we had the we already
53:46 had people
53:48 who uh that was MAA so she's she works
53:51 in AI ethics and
53:54 sustainability and she was like talking
53:56 about when she started it took a week to
53:59 train a logistic regression model and
54:02 that people in the computer science
54:04 didn't took AI seriously at all because
54:06 they thought like there is no like
54:10 there's no mathematical rigor in AI it's
54:13 just experimentation so people would
54:15 think that AI is not as valid and I
54:17 don't think anybody would say that today
54:19 so it's like really meaningful and also
54:22 there were a couple like one that I like
54:25 thought it was super
54:27 touching is somebody who started I
54:30 forgot her name right now but she
54:32 created a YouTube channel to
54:35 teach machine learning in Aruba so
54:39 people could learn machine learning in
54:41 their mod tongue and I've thought it was
54:42 so nice like it's not not the kind of
54:45 thing that you typically think about but
54:48 it's super impactful in a real life
54:50 scenario where is this country is it in
54:53 Africa somewhere yeah because I I don't
54:55 like I've heard the the the name of the
54:58 language but I I think it's um I think
55:01 the it's between Nigeria and Ghana that
55:03 are speakers so basically each
55:07 newsletter issue is an interview with a
55:11 woman who did something and then you
55:12 want to share the stories right yeah
55:15 exactly I mean it's really cool because
55:17 some people they come from typical
55:19 background some people did a total
55:21 career
55:22 180 and like you can always like take
55:25 something like some valuable advice from
55:28 from each of each one of them and it's
55:31 always like
55:32 uh the ones that I I found more
55:34 interesting is I remember somebody who
55:36 we interviewed she was a linkon car
55:38 director and we asked so how did you get
55:40 started and she just say there was a
55:42 form i f it and they contacted me so you
55:46 know like some sometimes you're like
55:47 okay so I can I can just do that if I'm
55:50 interested in doing that and I think
55:52 that's a very it seems like silly or
55:55 obvious but I think that's a very
55:56 valuable career lessons like if you want
55:58 something ask for it
56:01 if and things are simpler than they
56:04 appear right sometimes yeah yeah
56:06 sometimes they are and it's quite
56:07 empowering right it's quite motivating
56:09 because like now you know that the only
56:12 thing between you now and you being a
56:15 course instructor is this
56:16 form yeah and and like I also think it
56:19 forces people to put themselves out
56:21 there which I think if there's anything
56:23 I regret about the beginning of my
56:25 career is is I overthought every single
56:28 thing that I did and I I regret doing
56:32 that because you have like we we can
56:36 just try things and if things fail
56:38 things move on you learn from it you can
56:42 try the worst case scenario you get
56:44 rejected but rejection is not the end of
56:46 the world so I think as as long as you
56:49 keep exposing yourself and out there
56:51 like you really grow as a person and you
56:54 kind of like also learn a lot from it
56:57 mhm and if somebody wants
56:59 to somebody is listening to this right
57:02 now and think they have a story that
57:04 they want to share what's the best way
57:06 to contact you you can contact me via
57:08 LinkedIn or you can honestly if you on
57:11 substack you can just write to us on
57:12 substack on data like just send us a
57:15 private message that and we will take
57:17 your s dat like or like like like like
57:23 like like hard okay uh we I I don't see
57:28 a a link data like
57:32 sub probably I
57:36 will I cannot Google but you'll send us
57:39 a yeah yeah I'll send I found it so
57:43 there is a woman reading a book and it
57:44 says data alike we are a newsletter
57:47 dedicated to put the spotlight on
57:49 women's Journeys and achievement in the
57:51 data related field right mhm okay put in
57:55 the link now to the
57:58 chat
58:00 and yeah I think that's uh all we have
58:03 time for today so it was amazing thanks
58:06 for sharing your story and uh I think it
58:11 was motivating and will be motivating
58:13 for many people I hope so um if you do
58:18 that yeah thanks so much for having me
58:20 and if people want to reach out and want
58:22 to have a talk I'm all welcome to help
58:25 message me on Linked In on Twitter I
58:28 worst case scenario I take a while to
58:30 reply but I usually reply to
58:33 everybody okay thanks a lot thanks
58:37 everyone for joining us today and U well
58:41 today is Friday so have a nice weekend
58:44 and we'll see each other pretty soon
