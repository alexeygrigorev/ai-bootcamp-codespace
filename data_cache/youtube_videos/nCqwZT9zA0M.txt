0:00 welcome everyone um my name is Jonah and
0:04 welcome to dat do. club and um datat
0:08 talks. Club turns three today um so
0:13 we're talking about datat talks. Club um
0:16 and um for this occasion we've decided
0:18 to turn the mic around um and we have a
0:21 special guest today Alexi grigorov
0:24 himself um so welcome Alexi and thanks
0:28 for having me yes does it feel to be in
0:30 the guest
0:32 chair uh
0:34 strange I I mean it's not the first time
0:37 I'm a podcast guest but yeah it's but on
0:40 your
0:42 own yeah um cool I don't think I need to
0:45 introduce Alexi tum much um he's the
0:47 founder of um datat talks. Club as we
0:50 all know um and the questions for today
0:54 um maybe we should also mention yes some
0:58 information about the host yes maybe not
1:01 everyone knows that Johanna or Johanna
1:04 is actually the Mastermind behind all
1:07 the podcast episodes so like all the
1:10 questions that you hear me asking this
1:14 Johanna prepares them so thanks a lot
1:16 for doing that yeah no problem H it's
1:19 actually quite fun sometimes to uh
1:21 relisten to the actual podcast because I
1:23 prepare the questions and then you know
1:25 see what you what you make of
1:27 it sometimes you stick to them and some
1:30 times you just you know
1:32 sway yeah no it's been fun um so yeah um
1:37 this time the questions for um this
1:39 episode have been prepared mostly by the
1:41 community so we've asked for questions
1:43 you can still submit questions on slido
1:46 um and it's going to be like an AMA so
1:48 ask me anything for alexe um yeah so but
1:53 before we go into talking about the
1:55 community and do talk. Club um maybe
1:57 Alexi can you tell us a bit about about
2:00 yourself like your background and your
2:02 career
2:04 Journey it's funny so usually I ask that
2:07 question right now I need to answer this
2:10 too and I'm wondering how much far back
2:14 I should go so probably start with um so
2:17 I gradated um with a degree in
2:20 information technology and I studied oh
2:23 so I studied information technology and
2:25 after gradation I worked as a Java
2:27 developer for a few years
2:31 and my last work as a Java developer was
2:33 at a bank it was a Swiss bank and they
2:37 have highly regulated processes for
2:39 everything so while the job was um
2:42 interesting it was also sometimes
2:44 mundane and like kind of boring and I
2:47 thought okay like did I study for five
2:50 years to do Java like why did I study
2:54 all this math and then during this
2:56 time corsera this platform Cera appeared
3:00 and one of the courses there was machine
3:01 learning so I took that course and I
3:05 recognized that okay this looks like
3:08 something I want to do so I took this
3:10 course I took some other courses I ended
3:13 up doing a master's degree in business
3:16 intelligence this is how actually I
3:18 ended up in Germany so like the second
3:21 year of this degree of this program was
3:23 in Germany in Berlin and I like the city
3:26 so much that I decided to
3:28 stay and since then since graduation I
3:32 work as a data scientist I worked well
3:35 up to the point where I fully focused on
3:38 uh data do club which happened like this
3:40 year so during this time uh working as a
3:44 data
3:45 scientist like while my title was data
3:48 scientist I was doing like pretty much
3:50 everything which included like software
3:52 engineering data engineering ml
3:53 engineering data science too but funny
3:57 thing is
3:58 like um my last work was at oix I worked
4:02 there for four and a half years and over
4:06 this time over this period I trained a
4:08 model only once wow so
4:12 yeah I was mostly doing the engineering
4:14 stuff there even though my title was a
4:16 data scientist so it's a it's a fun fact
4:21 so yeah and now since April I fully
4:25 focus on data Lo club that is really
4:28 exciting do you still like what what
4:31 language did you do you use like in your
4:33 job probably not Java right like you
4:35 probably specialized on python well
4:37 right now mostly English no I mean
4:39 programming language yeah like for data
4:42 CL yeah sometimes uh well we use Python
4:46 for courses and I sometimes occasionally
4:48 write little
4:49 scripts to help with moderation uh like
4:54 with some other things like for example
4:56 for the courses uh that we do um so all
4:59 the scripts are in Python so for me like
5:02 the to go language is python yeah I
5:05 still I think I still remember some Java
5:08 you can still do a bit of JavaScript so
5:10 some of the code that we use for data
5:14 talkx club for example the code for
5:15 generating
5:17 certificates um like when you finish a
5:20 course you get the certificate so that
5:22 code is written with JavaScript but yeah
5:25 it's mostly python yeah yeah um I
5:28 started myself with python with Java
5:31 like way back but like not for I didn't
5:33 stay for very long so python is
5:36 definitely the better language I think
5:38 especially for machine learning cool um
5:41 yeah thank you so much Alexi I think um
5:43 we might actually jump into the first
5:45 question and um we have questions both
5:48 collected on slack and um by LinkedIn on
5:50 slider and I think we start with the
5:52 slider one once um so um the first
5:56 question is happy birthday datat tu.
5:58 clubs thank you
6:00 um what are the plans for the
6:02 future yeah so luckily I had access to
6:05 these questions before the interview
6:07 because otherwise this and some others
6:09 other ones would be I would have
6:12 troubles
6:14 answering um so right now
6:17 um
6:19 um I want to focus on making it
6:22 sustainable so since uh this is my main
6:26 job right now I want to also make sure I
6:29 don't star so I have money to survive
6:31 and Berlin is not a cheap the cheapest
6:33 City yeah so for me right now um so I'm
6:37 focusing on making it
6:38 sustainable and making sure that there
6:41 is enough income so for me and for the
6:43 team so there are there's also there are
6:46 also two people working for data talks
6:48 Club yeah Francis and Valeria so Francis
6:52 is the community manager so he takes
6:55 care for of like he's basically running
6:59 everything behind the scenes like all
7:01 the events are organized by him like all
7:03 the YouTube videos are published like
7:05 when we need to publish something or
7:07 edit like he edits a lot of videos um
7:11 like basically he's doing pretty much
7:13 everything so I would not be able to run
7:16 the community without his help yeah
7:18 massive shout out to fres like he's
7:20 pretty amazing yeah yeah so if anyone of
7:23 you were ever a speaker or a
7:27 guest uh in data do uh Club so Yana was
7:32 and usually Francis uh takes care of
7:35 reaching out and you know organizing
7:38 everything and then we have Valeria so
7:40 Valeria takes care of uh the newsletter
7:44 the social media content U and she helps
7:48 a lot with other things so I need to pay
7:51 them of course uh they like what they do
7:55 but yeah they're like it's a job so I
7:58 need to pay them I need to also get
8:00 money so for me for us the focus is
8:03 right now to um see how to make it
8:07 work so far it's been good um but I
8:10 still want to get focus on getting more
8:13 sponsors for the community yeah uh while
8:16 also trying to not overdo it CU I think
8:20 like if we push too heavy for
8:22 monetization it will um it will not help
8:27 attract more people right so like the we
8:29 need to find the right balance so what
8:32 we do right now is good we just need to
8:34 find more sponsors so I I think we kind
8:36 of find the right we managed to find the
8:39 right balance but we just need to find
8:41 more companies who want to support us so
8:44 that's uh my main activity right now
8:47 main main
8:50 focus but apart from that of course we
8:52 have a lot of activities uh we want to
8:54 continue doing these
8:56 activities and one of the things that
8:58 quite often comes up right now people
9:02 ask for an llm
9:04 course llm Zoom Camp yeah oh yes so so
9:08 could be I cannot promise anything cuz
9:11 I'm not right right now I'm not so sure
9:13 if this is just a hype and everyone
9:15 wants that because it's a hype thing uh
9:18 probably it would be wise to wait for 6
9:21 to 12 months to see what happens if the
9:24 the hype dies out or it's still there
9:29 and if it's still
9:31 there possible it's possible that we
9:33 consider making another course but also
9:36 like um for example we are quite lucky
9:38 with the three courses we have CU for
9:41 example right now we are running machine
9:44 learning engineering uh course ml Zoom
9:47 Camp yeah and it does not change
9:49 significantly from year to year yeah so
9:52 we need to maintain the content a little
9:53 bit Yeah but most of the content is this
9:56 is the content that I recorded three
9:57 years ago yeah yeah so we're kind of
9:59 Lucky and with
10:01 llm things like change every day right
10:05 yes it's so fast going and so yeah it's
10:08 still like such a new field um and
10:10 things come up yeah no I agree um but
10:14 could be could be a nice yeah it could
10:16 be also broader like not only Elm but
10:18 like more in general AI right like that
10:20 might be very exciting I didn't know
10:22 that um but yeah yeah it's quite a hype
10:25 at the moment um yeah very cool um
10:29 yeah also like with um I mean I am the
10:33 the reason that I got this job is
10:34 basically that I listed I I once mention
10:37 to Alexi that I that I listen to every
10:39 episode of the podcast because I'm an
10:41 avid podcast lover um and I do do fully
10:44 agree that just some um some podcasts
10:47 just have ads like you know a couple of
10:49 ads are fine but then if it gets too
10:51 much it's just not good so I I agree
10:54 there needs to be a balance and you also
10:55 don't want to abuse people right some
10:59 way so um but you also need like the
11:02 creator also needs to live I think
11:03 that's it's it's definitely a fine
11:05 balance um but yeah very cool um I think
11:09 cool then let's actually move to the
11:11 next question which kind of touches on
11:14 um what we've just discussed um how do
11:17 you think data jobs will change as
11:19 different GPT like Services come in play
11:22 and extend skills of data
11:25 professionals well that's an interesting
11:27 thing and of course nobody knows right
11:29 so we will only see that maybe in a year
11:32 or two when people start using them
11:36 actively cuz right now even though like
11:39 it's quite a hot area some data
11:42 scientists are still hesitant to to try
11:45 them right so but once uh the community
11:49 gets like once it gets more adoption
11:51 then it will become
11:52 interesting and I recently spoke with a
11:55 friend of mine also my ex- colleague he
11:58 has uh he's running his own startup
12:00 right now and he says right now the main
12:04 challenge when hiding when evaluating
12:07 candidates is charab because everyone
12:09 can just copy and paste the um like the
12:13 take take home test and GPT will just
12:17 provide the solution right yeah yeah and
12:20 uh so they were they're thinking what to
12:22 do with this and I like the metaphor he
12:25 used like for example um
12:29 um you know like there is wheat which is
12:32 considered drug marijuana right and many
12:35 countries try to fight it but some
12:37 countries say okay let's just embrace it
12:40 and allow people to use it cuz like
12:42 there's no point in fighting it people
12:44 will still smoke wheat right and he was
12:47 comparing wheat with
12:50 chpt by saying like let's legalize CH
12:53 GPT let's not uh let's not forbid it cuz
12:57 like okay you can
13:00 say people you you cannot use chpt but
13:03 people will still use it right yeah yeah
13:05 but what about just saying hey like for
13:07 our take-home test you can use chpt you
13:12 just have to tell us what prompts did
13:13 you use how exactly did you use it what
13:16 were the problems like what what were
13:18 the cases when it was not correct and
13:20 you needed to fix something so tell us
13:22 about that and I think this is a nice
13:25 approach so instead of saying hey like
13:27 chpt will take our
13:29 jobs um we should just learn to use it
13:33 yeah and learn to accept it yeah and see
13:36 what happens
13:38 right yeah so yeah that's uh we'll see
13:41 how it goes cuz I imagine like most uh
13:45 things like I don't know mundane uh
13:48 exploratory data analysis or I don't
13:50 know just training a simple model with
13:53 chbd you can just you know ask it and
13:57 then it will give you the code and then
13:59 you just use it yeah but yeah it's still
14:02 not ideal it's still buy it's still
14:05 hallucinates it comes up with functions
14:07 that do not exist and exactly yeah so
14:10 yeah let's see yeah um it's it's very
14:13 interesting that you say weed because I
14:15 just moved to the Netherlands and of
14:17 course like Netherland is one one of the
14:19 most Progressive countries with this
14:21 right um yeah but um that's actually a
14:23 really nice approach I like that and
14:25 it's kind of um I think you know many
14:28 companies use like whiteboard challenges
14:30 for like their hiring and it's the same
14:32 kind of you know in your normal life you
14:34 just Google right and like in some in
14:36 some way like CH is not that much more
14:39 than Googling I mean it can it can
14:41 nicely give you like like something
14:43 niely formatted that you can just hand
14:44 over but still I think it's a very good
14:47 idea actually yeah yeah yeah very cool
14:52 um nice um so then let's move on to the
14:57 next question that goes by back to um
15:00 datat talks. Club um from your
15:02 perspective how can members best
15:04 contribute to and benefit from the their
15:06 involvement in datat tax.
15:09 club yeah so this is
15:13 uh I think the best thing you can do is
15:18 be active on slack because like for data
15:21 talk Club slack is like the center of
15:24 the community of course we have many
15:25 many different activities like podcast
15:28 course
15:29 is but it kind of still centers around
15:31 slack there are questions in slack that
15:35 I that sometimes are left without
15:38 answers and I cannot physically go and
15:40 answer even though sometimes I do know
15:43 the answer I cannot just go and answer
15:47 that
15:49 and it's already happening to a pretty
15:52 large extent I see a lot of community
15:54 members jumping on and answering
15:56 questions so if more of us do that I
15:59 think the world will become a better
16:01 place and actually like why I suggest
16:04 that of course it's good that you help
16:08 um but I I look back um at my career
16:12 [Music]
16:13 and and I think about things that helped
16:16 me in my career so when I just started
16:18 my journey as a Java developer the first
16:21 thing I did was joining a Java community
16:24 so it was online
16:26 forums and I used that form to ask
16:31 questions but I did not have that many
16:34 questions and I notic that a lot of
16:37 people were asking questions and I could
16:40 able I was able to answer some of these
16:45 questions but also I noticed there were
16:47 questions that I was not able to
16:51 answer and some of these questions were
16:53 interesting and I thought like how about
16:55 I do a bit of research and find out how
16:58 to actually answer these questions wow
17:00 so I set aside like half an hour every
17:02 day to do that to help
17:05 people and over time it
17:07 accumulated like I learned a lot of new
17:10 things like by just doing a bit of
17:12 research doing a bit of Googling uh and
17:14 trying some things and like figuring out
17:17 what is wrong and how to help a person I
17:20 was able to learn so much myself that
17:23 the next job I already like I had no
17:26 difficulties whatsoever in passing the
17:28 job interview and also they like I
17:30 doubled my salary cuz I was so it was so
17:34 easy for me to pass the interview and I
17:36 was so confident that I'll be not just
17:39 qualified for this job I could do
17:41 everything that I needed so and it's
17:43 because of the communities right and the
17:45 same thing happened when I became a data
17:47 scientist so for my first uh when I got
17:52 my first job as a data scientist I also
17:54 joined the data science community and I
17:56 was doing the same thing so I was just
17:58 hanging out out in it was a slack
18:00 community so I was hanging out in this
18:03 slack Community it was a Russian
18:06 speaking Community called open data
18:08 science which actually inspired me to
18:10 create data dos Club I think one of the
18:12 questions is about that so I'll probably
18:15 talk about that
18:16 later and uh yeah so I was just hanging
18:20 out there asking my own questions but
18:23 also helping others and it helped me too
18:26 like it helped me tremendously so
18:29 what you can do to benefit from the
18:32 involvement in the community is just go
18:34 there and ask questions even though
18:37 maybe you don't know the answer right
18:39 and you can add a disclaimer hey I have
18:41 not deal dealt with this myself but I
18:44 did a quick Googling and this is what I
18:46 found out so here is the result right so
18:49 it will help everyone so that's one
18:52 thing but um like apart from slack we
18:55 have many other things so for example we
18:57 have three courses
18:59 and if you gradated from some of these
19:01 courses um and you want to help with the
19:04 course um you can help by maybe you want
19:07 to be a teaching assistant right so
19:09 that's also an option so you can ping me
19:11 in slack and say hey like I really enjoy
19:14 doing a mobom camp can I be a teaching
19:16 assistant
19:17 there or you can just again hang out in
19:20 the uh course channels and answer
19:22 questions from other community members
19:25 that will be super
19:27 helpful then we have a few things like
19:30 we want to run a competition so last
19:33 year we had we did a kle CLE competition
19:38 mhm it was a deep learning competition
19:41 so it was like we needed to classify
19:43 images of different kitchen utensils
19:46 like forks spoons or just kitchen stuff
19:50 like cups uh into these categories so
19:53 there is a picture of a spoon and the
19:54 model needs to say that it's a spoon
19:56 right it was a very fun competition
19:59 and we want to do something similar this
20:01 year uh so if you have some
20:04 ideas uh what could be the competition
20:06 about and how to get the data for this
20:08 competition which is the most difficult
20:10 part then yeah please uh reach out and
20:14 uh let's think how to do that I remember
20:17 you collected the data last year right
20:19 it was VI this phone app yeah I remember
20:21 that yeah yeah yeah yeah it was
20:24 fun yeah um so maybe this this year it
20:28 could be something with llms too um cuz
20:32 like with llms you can let's say you
20:35 have a lot of Text data and you can
20:37 label this data with LMS or generate
20:39 data with LMS so it could be that
20:43 too um another thing we have is called
20:46 project of the week so this is uh the
20:51 idea behind project of the week is more
20:53 like most of the content we have is we
20:56 show you how to do something and you
20:57 repeat so for example we have workshops
21:00 or we have the courses and in the
21:02 workshop there is a video and somebody
21:04 is doing something and you follow along
21:06 right but project of the week is
21:09 different so it's more like do it
21:11 yourself thing you get some instructions
21:13 or like more like it's uh it's not
21:17 something you have to do today it's more
21:19 like uh a suggestion this is what you
21:22 can do today for example let's say we
21:24 want you to learn I don't know fast API
21:27 or something like that like new
21:28 framework and there are some things you
21:31 can do to learn this thing like we give
21:34 you a set of suggestions and every day
21:37 you try
21:38 to uh look something up on Google try to
21:41 do something and then every day you can
21:43 say okay this is my progress and then
21:45 the idea is after 7 days you have a
21:48 complete project that you can put in
21:49 your portfolio so that's the idea behind
21:52 project of the week and we have uh quite
21:55 a few community members who are
21:58 um active there who are helping a lot
22:02 with that and coming up with projects
22:04 ideas so one of them Adonis is actually
22:07 right now in this live chat
22:09 hi and the other one is Liliana so
22:13 thanks a lot uh for your help but the
22:17 reason I'm saying that if you have some
22:21 ideas or you want to learn something new
22:24 you can help with organizing this
22:25 project of the week too um
22:29 yeah there's actually a lot more I I
22:31 think I can talk for hours about what
22:33 you can do but we have a lot of other
22:35 questions right yeah yeah I am yeah that
22:39 text is massive like and I'm still I'm
22:41 always surprised like how you do all of
22:43 these things because we also have like
22:44 the webinars and the podcast like right
22:46 like if people think they are
22:47 interesting if people think they are
22:49 interesting they can also like probably
22:51 reach out to fris we're always looking
22:53 for new guests but I think in general um
22:56 the one thing that how people can
22:58 benefit is um which dat club like uses
23:01 quite a bit is this learning in public
23:03 so always um if you learn something
23:06 tweet it or talk about it and we will
23:08 probably also like you know promote it
23:11 um I think that's also big part of the
23:14 zoom cams um yes to make it thanks for
23:17 mentioning this yeah yeah yeah um cool
23:21 um so then we move on um what are the
23:25 main lessons learned from your
23:27 experience in building the DTC online
23:31 community yeah so that was also I was
23:34 lucky to see to be able to see this
23:36 question before the interview because
23:38 it's like a very difficult question to
23:40 answer to be
23:41 honest um so yeah and I did a bit of
23:45 brainstorming and I came up with um a
23:48 few
23:49 things so I remember at the beginning
23:52 the goal was quite ambitious so the goal
23:54 was to create a community for all data
23:57 people which includes like data analysts
24:00 uh data Engineers data scientists I
24:03 don't know data product managers ml
24:05 Engineers like everyone who deals with
24:09 data but with time I realized that it's
24:12 too broad it's not possible to be that
24:15 broad um and there are already
24:17 communities for example like there's
24:19 Community called locally optimistic who
24:22 focuses more like on uh data product
24:24 manager and data analyst and then there
24:27 is a mlop Community yeah who focuses
24:29 more on
24:31 mvelopes um so we also kind needed to
24:34 focus on something so for data talks
24:36 Club it was more like um beginner
24:40 friendly Hands-On learning for a lot of
24:43 our content um so focus is more like on
24:46 people who start their career or
24:48 continue rather than who are advanced in
24:50 their career and with a lot of focus on
24:52 Hands-On stuff and with focus on
24:55 engineering aspects of data like uh ml
24:59 engineering data engineering mlops so
25:01 these are engineering heavy things where
25:04 you need to code a lot and our podcast
25:07 uh is still kind of well it's not so
25:10 super technical uh but still we talk
25:13 about like careers and things like that
25:15 who also that also appeal more to like
25:19 maybe beginner and intermediate level of
25:22 audience rather than like professionals
25:24 yeah so I guess uh with time we
25:28 actually found some Focus yeah uh but
25:31 still yeah so one of the lessons is like
25:33 you cannot be too ambitious you need to
25:35 to focus on
25:37 something then another thing is
25:39 moderation so I did not expect that
25:40 moderation would take so much time like
25:44 uh it was there was a funny story
25:46 that a few times people tried to use the
25:50 community as a dating app as a dating
25:52 website
25:53 what I don't know if there were any
25:56 success stories but but I know I know
25:58 that there were unsuccessful stories
26:02 when uh ladies in the community did not
26:05 like the attention they received from
26:06 some community
26:07 members and yeah of course this is like
26:11 this is not why you join a professional
26:12 Community to get private messages saying
26:15 hey QT how about a date right oh my God
26:19 so yeah I had to deal with this
26:24 stuff um so maybe there is like there
26:28 was a successful case like last story
26:30 but I'm not aware of that most of the
26:33 time it was unsolicited attention oh my
26:36 God yeah U and like in general
26:39 moderation is like people are trying to
26:41 promote their services uh either in
26:44 public or in private messages and in
26:46 private messages it's more difficult
26:48 because I don't see that right yeah so
26:49 in public I can just remove the post
26:52 yeah but if somebody is trying to send
26:55 unsolicited promotion through direct
26:56 messages it's very very difficult to
26:58 yeah uh catch that so sometimes they
27:02 send this promotion message to me too
27:05 and then I I know what to do right but
27:09 if they careful and see okay like this
27:11 person is an admin I will not send him a
27:13 message and send to like other people
27:16 then yeah so please like if something
27:19 like that happens please uh uh let
27:22 Francis or me know about that and we
27:25 will B this uh uh this person because
27:28 it's against our community guidelines to
27:31 send us unsolicited promotion messages
27:34 in
27:35 DM yeah but I also did a bit of
27:38 automation with that so when somebody
27:41 joins uh the general Channel and or this
27:44 when somebody joins the community and
27:46 immediately jumps to the general Channel
27:48 and post like a big promotional message
27:51 I already have a script a bot that
27:54 removes that and sends a an automatic
27:57 direct message Mage to that person
27:58 saying hey it's against the rules we
28:00 have these channels this is how the the
28:03 messages should be formatted like if you
28:05 want to publish something so for me it's
28:07 just a matter
28:08 of uh adding a special reaction to this
28:12 post and then the B handles that so
28:14 that's uh that was fun to to
28:19 create yeah I guess this two um also I'm
28:24 still trying to figure out like what was
28:26 surprising for me is like how eager
28:28 people were to join the community and
28:30 participate in different activities and
28:32 also do something too in the community
28:36 that's really cool yeah I'm still trying
28:38 to think how to encourage this recognize
28:41 and encourage this and reward this actic
28:44 participation and actic participants so
28:47 one thing is uh inviting them to the
28:49 podcast yeah but probably there's much
28:52 more we can do so I'm still thinking
28:53 about that but it it's it's really
28:56 rewarding to see that people are very
28:59 active in the community and are doing
29:01 something for the community too so it's
29:02 really cool thanks for doing that thanks
29:05 one more time I know you're here you're
29:07 listening you're doing a lot for this
29:09 community
29:11 thanks yeah I think um in general people
29:13 are quite happy to um so at least for me
29:16 like you know people have an interest
29:18 and if they find like people that have a
29:20 similar interest it's just really great
29:22 um although like like you said there
29:24 might be like some you know I don't know
29:27 yeah it's always good to have a code of
29:29 conduct to kind of you know um guide
29:32 these conversations please don't use
29:33 data do Club as a dating web like Tinder
29:36 works much better try that one oh my God
29:42 all
29:43 right um cool so um let's just move on
29:49 um what was the motive behind starting
29:52 the club and the zoom camps I think
29:53 we've touched um briefly on that already
29:56 yeah so yeah for me as I said uh
29:59 communities were quite a big part of my
30:02 life and career so they helped me a
30:05 lot and I was uh quite active in this
30:08 Russian speaking Community called open
30:10 data science and sadly I could not find
30:13 anything similar in the English speaking
30:17 space uh which were like a community
30:20 that was also active that was also on
30:22 slack and my initial idea was to create
30:25 something
30:26 similar to
30:28 that but uh so actually the story is
30:31 like how it happened is um I was doing
30:34 some career consultations a lot of
30:36 people were reaching out uh to me on
30:38 LinkedIn saying hey I'm a data analyst I
30:41 want to become a data scientist or I a
30:43 software engineer I want to become a
30:44 data engineer or I don't know help me
30:47 figure out what I want from life things
30:50 like that and I would uh back then it
30:53 was during
30:54 coid um so I so kind of wanted to talk
30:58 to people like sitting at home was not
31:01 fun and I was doing this free career
31:04 consultations H which involved like
31:07 talking to a person and then like
31:09 sending them a summary I'm not doing
31:11 that now but back then it was it was fun
31:14 and then I did like 30 of these
31:16 consultations and I thought it would be
31:18 very nice to have a place where all
31:22 these people can hang out and help each
31:24 other cuz like if I try to help everyone
31:28 it's not scalable right so I cannot help
31:30 every single person yeah and it might be
31:33 repetitive or something yeah it's it
31:35 becomes very repetitive cuz like for
31:37 example for like how do I become a
31:39 machine learning engineer the answer is
31:40 like I don't know go buy my book right
31:42 but
31:42 it's people might find this answer
31:45 annoying because it's like very
31:47 promotional um anyways uh so I was
31:50 thinking like
31:53 if there was a space where all these
31:55 people can hang out
31:57 and help each other and it would be more
32:00 like not uh me helping everyone but
32:03 people would help each other so for
32:04 example I helped somebody and that
32:06 person would help somebody else right
32:08 and then that person in general would
32:10 help somebody
32:11 else and yeah this is um one day I woke
32:14 up I registered this SL Community I went
32:17 to go da I bought a
32:20 domain I think it costed like1 15 or
32:22 something like that and then I put a
32:26 link I didn't not advertise it anywhere
32:28 I put this link to my uh LinkedIn page I
32:34 did not make a post it was just in the
32:36 description and I put it in U my
32:40 GitHub right and then I started seeing
32:43 what happens and people were joining it
32:47 right so they would accidentally see
32:49 this link or somebody else would um say
32:52 hey like I found this cool Community
32:54 join it and then like
32:57 in a week maybe there was 100 people wow
33:01 there like in a month it was more than a
33:04 few
33:05 hundred and it was like I did not
33:07 actively promote it so people like
33:09 community members would just say hey
33:11 like there's this cool place uh check it
33:15 out and uh yeah so it was very
33:19 motivating and
33:21 uh yeah at some point A friend of mine
33:24 asked if I know a place where he can
33:27 give a talk so yeah come over give a
33:30 talk and then like since then it was
33:33 like our first webinar SL Workshop yeah
33:36 and then since then we started having
33:37 regular activities like
33:39 regular
33:41 um Regular events and I think the other
33:44 part of the question was about the zoom
33:46 camps right yeah yeah
33:49 so it I always wanted to do a course so
33:52 like when I was
33:54 um in this open data science Community
33:58 there was a very good
34:00 course uh called mlcourse.ai
34:04 um it's also available in English I did
34:07 this in Russian but it's also
34:08 translated and it was a free course with
34:11 focus on the theory behind machine
34:13 learning with a lot of coding also there
34:16 was a
34:16 competition and it was so well organized
34:19 and the main thing that I liked about
34:22 that was that it was community-driven so
34:26 there was of course like the Project
34:27 Lead the course lead but also lessons
34:29 were prepared by different community
34:31 members and these community members were
34:33 helping each other in slack when the
34:35 course was running I thought it's so
34:38 cool like it's such a great thing like
34:40 the course is for free people help each
34:42 other and then people share stories like
34:45 okay they did this and then they how
34:46 they found like a great job after
34:49 finishing this
34:50 course I thought like it's so cool I
34:53 want to have something in our community
34:55 too and also um I I think I mentioned
34:59 the book so I wrote a book about machine
35:01 learning engineering at some point and
35:03 this book was not selling well it's
35:05 still not selling well because like it's
35:08 very hard to compete against other
35:12 really great books because there are so
35:14 many good books about machine learning
35:16 so now in retrospect I think maybe it
35:19 did not make much sense to write another
35:21 one cuz there were so many of them
35:24 already lo you created the courses now
35:26 they basically competing to the book
35:28 right
35:30 basically but um I was thinking like how
35:32 can I promote the book right right
35:35 what's the best way of doing
35:37 that and like these two ideas like there
35:41 was this course that I really liked and
35:42 now I have a book that I want to promote
35:44 they kind of came together I thought H
35:48 how about I make a course based on the
35:50 book right yeah and then it would help
35:53 with promoting the book it will help
35:55 with promoting the community and it will
35:58 help you know do what I wanted like the
36:02 that other
36:04 course and I ran like uh I think it was
36:07 a post on LinkedIn or like some
36:10 something like that so I did not put any
36:12 effort into that I just wanted to check
36:14 if there's interest and there was a lot
36:16 of interest so I thought okay I'm doing
36:19 that so this is how we did the full the
36:22 first
36:24 course mlom Camp uh as I said it did not
36:27 help with promoting the book I mean
36:30 people knew about the book but not many
36:32 of them were actually buying
36:34 it because like the course is for free
36:37 right yeah exactly that's that's what I
36:39 yeah like why pay for a book like I
36:41 don't think I would pay for a book
36:43 to but uh yeah and to be honest like I
36:45 don't get a lot of uh money from this
36:47 from selling the book it did help to
36:50 some extent with promoting like without
36:52 the course even fewer people would buy
36:54 it but now actually some people say hey
36:56 like I buy this book and I use it as a
36:59 textbook for the course which is cool
37:01 yeah um
37:03 yeah how much do you think no how much
37:06 do you think that Co kind of contributed
37:08 to the fact that it's an online
37:10 community like would you have created
37:12 like a meet up or something in Berlin
37:15 otherwise no okay so it's not a a CO
37:19 baby it is a CO baby I don't think
37:21 people would so eager to join an online
37:24 community if it was today for example
37:26 yeah like the timing was
37:28 right even though for me the idea was
37:31 from the beginning to create an online
37:33 community the fact that it was during
37:35 the co helped because right now I think
37:39 during the co like at the beginning it
37:40 was kind of okay but then like in 2020
37:45 it was okay
37:46 2021 year was already like H so much
37:49 stuff happening online like I have this
37:51 uh yeah but this community already had
37:54 some momentum right so they were already
37:56 community members like the courses and
37:58 so on uh so I think being in
38:02 this starting during the co times helped
38:06 especially in September um so I remember
38:09 so summer was fine and people were
38:12 hoping that you know the normal life
38:14 comes back yes yeah but then in
38:16 September the cases started to go up
38:18 again and like everyone was locked at
38:21 home again and yes it was just the right
38:24 timing so I I don't think it would do as
38:27 well now if let's say if I started data
38:31 do club today I don't think it would do
38:35 as well as three years ago yeah although
38:38 like on the other hand side like um I
38:40 think a lot of um communities were
38:42 created at least you know I'm coming
38:43 from the podcast side like um because I
38:45 listen to a lot of podcasts and a lot of
38:47 podcasts were created during Co but they
38:49 were all like they all SLO now so I
38:51 think it is it is kind of um how do you
38:54 say like a badge or like is something
38:57 special that this community is still
38:58 liveing like because a lot of didn't
39:00 survive the co C right so um yeah maybe
39:04 if it was just the podcast it wouldn't
39:06 be active that's true but we had too
39:09 many other things yeah yeah so that's
39:13 that's part of the business model right
39:15 I guess so many things cool um so then
39:20 um an interesting one what typical not
39:22 extraordinary success stories of your
39:24 students were in a last year uh what it
39:29 we
39:30 call not extraordinary ah like usual
39:35 well we had cases when people wanted to
39:37 switch their careers and they did so I
39:41 don't know what else to to tell like
39:43 somebody um so for example just uh
39:47 yesterday one of the guests uh podcast
39:50 guests Maran um we did uh I interviewed
39:54 him The Talk The the interview was
39:56 called hacking your data career so
39:59 Marian Marcos it was like a year or two
40:02 ago so he reached out to me through
40:04 Linkedin saying that he attended a uh a
40:07 conference P data Amsterdam and then
40:10 somebody on that conference approached
40:12 him
40:13 saying hey like I listened to your
40:17 interview on data do club and this
40:20 interview changed my life like he got so
40:23 inspired that he switched his career now
40:25 he works as a data
40:27 engineer so not only that interview but
40:30 he also did our data engineering Boot
40:32 Camp or Zoom
40:33 camp and he changed his career and then
40:37 Mar reached out to me saying he this is
40:40 such a cool thing to hear when somebody
40:42 approaches you on the conference and
40:45 says like look not only I know you but
40:48 also you changed my life
40:51 wow well that is pretty much the dream
40:54 right like so these things
40:56 and like uh it's a typical not
40:59 extraordinary
41:00 story
41:02 um there were of course stories when
41:04 like there was
41:06 a somebody like from school still from
41:10 like he was a student at school and then
41:13 he did our M Zoom camp and he got an
41:17 internship and then he did pretty well
41:20 there but then he decided okay I want to
41:22 study at University and he left the
41:24 internship so I think it's pretty cool
41:27 when uh people earlier in their career
41:31 like even before the university oh yeah
41:33 already have access to materials like
41:36 that can learn something and then
41:39 already be ready to do a job right I
41:42 don't think it's a typical situation I
41:43 don't think most of our community
41:45 members and students are uh school
41:48 students yeah I think uh
41:51 usually most of the students are
41:54 more they're not students anymore right
41:56 so they're already working yeah in some
41:59 role and they want to change uh so
42:04 yeah yeah um I mean in general I think
42:07 um podcasts are good they usually like
42:09 why I listen to them is like because of
42:11 your inspiration or motivation right
42:13 like it doesn't need need to be like oh
42:15 I changed my career after that but like
42:18 I often like you know I wake up in the
42:19 morning I have no no I I just don't want
42:22 to work and then I listen to someone who
42:23 like you know did something amazing like
42:26 okay I can do this you know this person
42:29 like did this amazing thing so I can go
42:32 and like finish this analysis or
42:34 whatever so sometimes it's even like
42:36 yeah small things right um so cool very
42:39 cool yeah I think I do think that um
42:42 these communities like impact so many
42:44 people in so many ways um which is good
42:47 it's really good um cool um then what
42:53 topics or Trends in the data world are
42:55 you most excited about EXP exploring
42:56 upcoming club events or
42:59 interviews so yeah the thing with me is
43:01 I'm not really interested in chasing
43:06 hype topics that's
43:08 why only like one month ago we had our
43:11 first interview about llms which were
43:14 super it was super late for like
43:17 considering how long Chad for how long
43:20 chbt has been around so we were super
43:23 late to the party with uh inm
43:27 interview so the the
43:30 way I usually do it or we usually do it
43:34 so I'm more interested in interviewing a
43:36 specific person yeah and then see what
43:39 kind of topics they want to share and
43:41 then um
43:43 usually there are a few things anyone
43:45 can talk about and you Yana know more
43:49 than anyone that because you do this
43:52 initial calls with our guests to explore
43:55 what things they can share yeah uh so
43:58 for me it's more like a person and then
44:00 figuring out what this person can talk
44:02 about what or maybe we we have done
44:06 something previously but it can be like
44:08 a different angle slightly yeah so
44:11 that's why um like I don't know what
44:14 exactly like I'm not really following
44:17 Trends and we recently did two actually
44:20 it was two talks about llms it was a
44:23 coincidence right because like in both
44:25 these cases
44:27 there were specific people I wanted to
44:30 interview and turned out that in both
44:32 these cases the topic was llm and they
44:36 were not conflicting with each other so
44:38 they like they were slightly different
44:41 so this is how I like to approach that
44:44 but yeah maybe you can suggest some
44:46 topics so for example if there is a
44:47 topic that you're interested in and we
44:50 haven't done a podcast interview about
44:52 that yeah just reach out to somebody or
44:56 of us and suggest that and also if you
44:59 know a speaker who can talk about that
45:00 it would be even
45:03 better yeah and make sure that it's
45:06 really has not been suggested you know
45:07 go through the whole history of no
45:10 kidding it's kind of difficult I think
45:12 uh I think it's okay to repeat a little
45:14 bit right so like if we talk about
45:17 mentoring 3 years ago right so maybe
45:21 like we can do another podcast episode
45:23 about mentoring from a different exactly
45:26 like because it's always a different
45:27 person so it's definitely a different
45:29 angle um no but I I think we would run
45:32 out of Topics by now yes we would no but
45:35 I I um I mean we hear from LM lmm and
45:39 like um everywhere at the moment right
45:41 yeah so yeah I don't think maybe it's
45:44 not a good idea to have like two three
45:47 more talks yeah
45:49 exactly cool um then the next question
45:54 is um do you have have a funny story to
45:56 share that happened in it um three years
45:59 in data talks. club that comes from
46:00 Antonis actually it's a question from
46:02 Anon yeah I was thinking about that I
46:07 don't know for me the most funny story
46:08 was like that people consider it using
46:11 data do CL as a dating
46:13 website like I could not even imagine
46:18 that this would happen yeah right it's
46:22 it just did not occur to me at all that
46:25 of of course I did not think of putting
46:27 this on the website or in our code of
46:30 conduct in the community gu guidelines
46:32 it just did not occur to me that it's
46:34 possible that somebody might use a
46:37 professional
46:38 Community to reach out to in this case
46:41 it was a male reaching out to female
46:45 participants yeah it it's kind of funny
46:48 but also gross so I don't know uh but it
46:52 was uh memorable yeah yeah like um I
46:56 don't know usually these people don't
46:58 join the community for the professional
47:00 part in the first place I would imagine
47:03 yes that's my experience like you know
47:06 with communities and like being
47:08 approached in that way so um but yeah
47:11 it's it's uh it's definitely you never
47:15 you never anticipate enough to be you
47:18 know people always surprise you yeah but
47:21 also like if you're a female participant
47:24 and you get some attention that don't
47:26 want to
47:27 receive um probably like the KNE jerk
47:30 reaction would be to leave the
47:32 community uh but I would ask you to give
47:34 us another chance right report that
47:36 person and stick around cuz like yeah
47:39 it's not appropriate it's not an
47:41 appropriate behavior we do not encourage
47:43 this Behavior so we would deal with this
47:47 person and uh we want to have the to
47:50 have a safe space where everyone can uh
47:54 yeah learn share knowledge and so on
47:58 yeah yeah and there are actually also
48:00 enough I think there actually that's
48:02 something that I find actually also
48:03 remarkable like I'm in a lot of
48:06 communities um as a woman in more techy
48:09 space and the um percentage of wom in DT
48:13 UMC is actually quite high so you can
48:15 always reach out like to other um women
48:18 or like to me if you find me on their um
48:21 aoxy like
48:23 um yeah um so we've actually answered
48:27 this one um how did you how did it come
48:32 that you wrote The Machine learning book
48:34 I think we've touched on that one a
48:35 little bit do you want to talk about
48:37 that one or so see we don't have a lot
48:39 of time I'll try to give a short I don't
48:41 think I am able I capable of giving
48:44 short answers in
48:45 J I'll try so like it's not my first
48:48 book so the first book uh well it's
48:51 story this is a long story I'll I'll
48:54 tell it any
48:56 so well some time ago I was reviewing
48:59 books for packed publishing this is a
49:02 publisher yeah I was uh still
49:06 transitioning from the Java developer to
49:09 a data
49:10 scientist and they reached out to me
49:12 saying hey we found your blog about Java
49:15 and we have this book about Java how
49:17 about you review this book and then I
49:19 did that I was a technical reviewer then
49:21 I reviewed another book and then another
49:24 book and then I said look maybe you can
49:26 start sending me machine learning books
49:28 because this is what I'm more interested
49:30 in and I said okay here's the machine
49:33 learning book so they did not even try
49:36 to check if I know this topic which was
49:40 cool so by then hopefully I learned
49:44 enough of machine learning to to be able
49:47 to help and uh I reviewed like I don't
49:50 know five more maybe books about machine
49:53 learning and they wrote me me saying hey
49:56 you're good you're so good at reviewing
49:58 the books maybe you write you want to
50:00 write one and I thought hm maybe I
50:03 do and they say okay like looks like you
50:06 know Java you know machine learning how
50:08 about writing a book about Java and
50:10 machine learning and back then I thought
50:12 it's a good idea don't do that it's not
50:14 a good idea CU like who cares about Java
50:18 everyone uses python but back then I
50:20 thought it's a good idea so I wrote a
50:22 book it was called master in Java or
50:26 data science something like that I don't
50:29 remember yeah so that was my first
50:32 book yeah it's so usually when you write
50:36 a book the contract is that the
50:38 publisher gives you some advanc money
50:40 Advan payment and then like which each
50:44 uh sold copy you get like some royalty
50:47 some percent so with this book it's
50:50 still uh so they G gave me some advances
50:54 Advan payment
50:55 and like the book still hasn't reached
50:58 that point when it would break
50:59 even so like it's not setting well but
51:03 yeah I would also expect more promotion
51:05 from the publisher but anyways then
51:07 there was another book that I wrote with
51:11 coauthors I wasn't alone there it was
51:14 like four or five authors I did not like
51:18 that book so that's why don't put it in
51:20 my CD it was about um T flow projects so
51:26 it was a book about um doing projects
51:29 with tensorflow so it was like 10
51:31 chapters and each chapter was a
51:33 project but funny thing is uh like even
51:36 though I did not like the book I did not
51:38 like the outcome I did not like the
51:40 process uh so I wanted to Pretend This
51:43 Book never happened funny thing is that
51:47 people from a different publisher
51:50 noticed that book and reached out to me
51:52 saying we saw this book we really liked
51:55 it it was a surprise for me like why
51:57 would anyone like that but they did and
52:00 they say we want to have a similar book
52:02 how about you write this book and we
52:05 decided to come up with this concept
52:06 that there is a chapter and every
52:08 chapter is a project and then by the end
52:10 of this each project you have like by
52:12 the end of each chapter you have like a
52:14 project that you can put in your
52:16 portfolio so this is how we came up with
52:19 this
52:20 concept and I started writing this
52:22 machine learning book Camp so this
52:25 actually it was their idea to name it
52:27 like that uh somebody from marketing uh
52:31 in Manning decided that yeah this is a
52:33 good
52:34 title so it took two years I think so
52:38 the mining is really uh they invest they
52:43 put a lot of effort in making sure that
52:45 book is has very good quality so it was
52:49 very painful yeah like all these
52:51 processes like they are there for a
52:53 reason but for me is an author it was
52:55 like ah there are 10 more comments that
52:57 I need to address like I'm so
53:01 tired why did they agree to this but
53:04 finally this book came out and U yeah
53:09 the rest of the story you know like how
53:11 it became a course and so
53:13 on that is pretty amazing I didn't know
53:16 that but it also seems that your blog
53:18 was kind of the starting point so maybe
53:21 yeah and it was in Russian like I don't
53:22 know how they found it oh my God so like
53:25 that take home like if you want to start
53:27 with publishing start with a Blog maybe
53:30 and I what I wanted to ask um is um at
53:34 that so at what stage of the publishing
53:37 process were you reviewing for packed
53:40 like is it like it's uh like each
53:42 chapter like when each chapter was ready
53:45 they would send a draft and I would
53:46 review the draft back yeah so it wasn't
53:51 like okay here's the book review it it
53:53 was like uh as the book was being
53:57 written um like each chapter they would
54:00 send each chapter to me I would review
54:02 send back and Mining follows a different
54:07 process so instead of so they have in
54:09 house uh technical reviewers who do this
54:12 for each of the chapters but then like
54:15 there are three or four chapters and
54:16 then it's sent to um to people for
54:19 reviewing to not in-house reviewers so
54:23 the process is slightly different
54:25 but yeah so it's a for work in progress
54:30 books wow yeah because there's also this
54:33 Discord Channel by packed where you can
54:36 um so they have these giveaways where
54:38 you get books and you but they're like
54:40 finished like like basically you're the
54:43 reviewer from the public so you can get
54:45 them and you kind of read them and then
54:47 write a short review and um Amazon right
54:51 I'm not sure no it's like no that you
54:52 like send it back to pack basically so
54:55 so you send it back to them and they
54:57 they they just need it so it's it's the
54:59 last stage before it gets published
55:01 basically so they solicit like um
55:04 feedback from the community basically
55:06 but it's a good way to get like books
55:08 for free basically um so I've done that
55:12 a couple of times so that's why I was
55:13 interested um well there are good books
55:15 unpacked yeah definitely yeah definitely
55:20 um maybe we have like time for one last
55:23 questions what you what do you think um
55:25 yeah if you have time maybe we can take
55:27 a few more okay cool um so then uh
55:31 congratulations on your huge success
55:33 Alexi is there anything um you would
55:36 love to do but didn't have the time to
55:38 do
55:39 it oh yeah I think I have a list
55:42 somewhere with all these ideas that we
55:44 wanted to try but never
55:48 managed yeah like for example doing a
55:50 hakone one thing that comes to mind yeah
55:54 uh so for example in the courses we have
55:57 a lot of questions and these questions
55:58 are so repetitive like and we have FAQ
56:01 documents where all these questions are
56:04 already answered or most of these
56:07 questions um so there was an idea to
56:09 somehow automate it and make hon about
56:12 this right a about but interestingly
56:15 even without running a proper hackaton
56:17 some community
56:19 members uh one of them is Alex uh so he
56:23 came up with this idea Hey how about I
56:25 do this myself and then he he when he
56:28 reached out it was already a working
56:29 thing saying hey I did this how about we
56:32 now test it wow it was so cool yeah
56:36 uh and yeah it's it's working fine so it
56:39 was he did this for the mlops course and
56:43 now he's doing this for the ml course ml
56:46 engineering course so it's really cool
56:48 and it works quite well so the bot would
56:50 see that uh the bot would look at the
56:52 question and then look at uh all the of
56:56 course it uses L LMS it would look at
56:58 all the other questions in the fq
57:00 document and say okay like for this
57:02 question this is the answer and it's
57:05 like uh this typical um use case for
57:09 llms where you have some knowledge base
57:11 and you have an a question and you want
57:13 to retrieve the answer to this question
57:16 from this knowledge base and he he wrote
57:20 a post on LinkedIn saying what is the
57:23 stack behind that so it's say really
57:25 cool project wow so I wanted to make a
57:27 hakon but never managed but then it just
57:31 happened uh another thing is like um all
57:34 these events we have we use
57:36 Eventbrite I don't really like even
57:38 bright Eventbrite for it's not the most
57:41 convenient
57:42 platform but the cool thing about event
57:44 bride event prite is that it stores the
57:46 emails of each person who registered so
57:50 what we can do with this is build a Rec
57:52 Commander
57:53 system that uh saying okay like this
57:56 person would be interested in this
57:57 events and for example when there is a
57:59 new event we potentially can see who
58:03 which community members would be
58:04 interested in this event this particular
58:06 one and then send emails or somehow
58:09 notify them about this of course we need
58:12 to think like about you know opting out
58:14 opting into that but as an idea this is
58:17 what we have and in addition to that
58:21 like I don't really like even bright so
58:23 maybe creating something in Jungle
58:25 uh for managing events would be another
58:28 thing so could be another hakon project
58:31 but then like with so many things
58:33 already happening it's always hard to
58:35 find time to to squeeze in one extra
58:39 thing but maybe like if anyone of you is
58:42 listening to this and you like this idea
58:43 of a hakon maybe you can reach out to us
58:47 and we see like how we can make it
58:50 happen yeah um hackathons are also
58:53 they're amazing but they're just
58:55 like they the epiphany of time intensive
58:58 right like because you sign up for
59:00 couple of
59:01 days right of your real life um if you
59:04 want to do it like that um but they're
59:06 very cool I've done several hackathons
59:08 and I love it um but like yeah it's it's
59:11 definitely easier of any your student
59:13 you can just uh be missing so maybe we
59:16 can do one more question yep um let me
59:22 just um how do you evaluate the success
59:27 of the efforts of the initiative and
59:29 purpose um okay there are a few metrics
59:33 that I look at so in terms of bringing
59:37 money the most um um how to say the most
59:41 effective thing is our newsletter so if
59:43 you're subscribed to our newsletter you
59:45 probably saw that there is a sponsored
59:47 Block in the newsletter this is
59:50 how maybe like 50 60% of money that we
59:53 earn in data Club this is where it comes
59:55 from so for us the number of
1:00:00 subscribers who open the um the email is
1:00:04 a important magic because it directly
1:00:06 translates to money so this is what I
1:00:09 look at and when it's growing and people
1:00:12 keep opening the email despite the fact
1:00:14 that there's this sponsored block that's
1:00:17 really good and this is uh what I
1:00:19 personally look at then of course the
1:00:22 the number of people in the community
1:00:25 uh but it's also like right now it's
1:00:27 almost 40,000 but it's also like the
1:00:30 other interesting metric is the number
1:00:33 of active people so of course not all
1:00:35 40,000 are active so somebody comes for
1:00:38 the course they take the course they
1:00:40 leave and leave the community which is
1:00:42 totally fine or somebody comes and finds
1:00:44 out okay this I'm not really interested
1:00:46 in this community and leave this is also
1:00:48 fine but looking at the number of active
1:00:50 people is another metric that I look
1:00:53 at
1:00:55 and also like engagement in social media
1:00:58 this is something I think quite
1:00:59 important because social media helps us
1:01:02 bring new people to the
1:01:04 community YouTube views um so if uh if
1:01:09 content is interesting usually a stream
1:01:11 has more YouTube views more views on
1:01:13 YouTube than like non interesting
1:01:15 content so then we get the signals too
1:01:17 to see like what really resonates with
1:01:20 uh the
1:01:22 community um so yeah and then uh again
1:01:26 another thing another big thing is do
1:01:29 sponsors willing to give us money right
1:01:31 yeah so do they find this community
1:01:34 attractive for them to actually give us
1:01:35 money that's probably the main uh
1:01:39 success crateria I would say so if they
1:01:42 do then we're doing something useful
1:01:45 because there are companies who want to
1:01:47 support
1:01:49 us yeah very cool um yeah so um um I
1:01:55 think um we have maxed out the hour
1:01:58 um there's two more questions left but
1:02:01 maybe maybe can you can answer them in
1:02:03 in slack or something um yeah maybe yeah
1:02:07 um cool um that was really super
1:02:09 interesting I I've been around for quite
1:02:12 a bit but I've learned a lot I hope it
1:02:14 was interesting to the community thanks
1:02:16 everyone for submitting um your
1:02:18 questions and for the par particip
1:02:22 participation and um next time you will
1:02:26 see Alexi again in the kind of host
1:02:29 chair um and me behind the scenes
1:02:32 probably totally and probably we need to
1:02:35 invite you for another interview oh yeah
1:02:39 I can talk about it's been a while it
1:02:41 has been a while and I can talk about
1:02:43 like the um liberal weed uh kind of
1:02:46 policy in the in the Netherlands okay
1:02:48 that would be unusual but interesting
1:02:51 thanks Yana a lot for joining us today
1:02:53 and um
1:02:55 being the host for this interview it was
1:02:57 very fun it was a lot of fun cool all
1:03:00 right
