1:10 mentoring in data analytics we have a
1:12 special guest today Irina Irina works as
1:14 a teacher and curriculum developer for
1:16 data analytics and data science at
1:17 throwing Loop which is an NGO in Germany
1:21 judging from the name frauin means women
1:23 yeah and also AI Globe actually
1:29 Irina studied computer science in
1:32 Romania and Germany and she has worked
1:34 at a variety of tech companies in Berlin

1:44 women in Tech
1:46 so welcome Molina Welcome to our show
1:47 thank you very much for having me Alexei
1:50 I'm very happy to be here and tell
1:54 that are like these are my Moonlighting
1:56 jobs you know the nine to five is
1:58 daylight and teaching and all of these
2:00 things are my Moonlighting but it's a
2:02 great passion
2:04 okay now I also wanted to mention that
2:06 the questions for today interview are
2:08 prepared by Johanna Bayer thanks Johanna
2:10 for your help and let's get started so
2:14 before we go into our main topic of
2:16 teaching and mentoring in data analytics
2:18 let's start with your background can you
2:20 tell us about your career Journey so far
2:22 absolutely how many minutes
2:25 um right
2:29 all right five I don't know take your
2:31 time I was uh I come from Romania I was
2:34 born in 83 and to a family of nerds so
2:38 lucky enough I got to code already at
2:41 the age 12 because I got bored in my
2:43 school and I wanted to touch a
2:45 see what the heck that computer is doing
2:47 which was basic so twitch H 11 12 11.
2:52 they were making us knit and making us
2:55 need and I finished all the knitting and
2:57 embroidery I don't know how this is
2:58 called
3:00 yeah but you know what I mean and I was
3:02 like I'm done with this now I'm giving
3:03 that that green screen computer I wanted
3:07 um
3:08 of course we also grew up with
3:09 mathematics books and our dad doing
3:11 puzzles and uh I always knew I wanted to
3:15 go to mathematics and computer science
3:16 after that because I really liked him
3:19 honest uh funny enough my brother was
3:21 always faster than me and he was like
3:24 I'm not going to study computers I was
3:25 like but I am I have to be the quickest
3:27 so this is kind of like we had a very
3:29 geeky childhood
3:30 uh so my dad was a professor in AI my
3:33 mom was a database analyst
3:38 um second generation data analyst
3:40 basically yeah yeah
3:43 um so I always wanted to go study
3:48 computer science this is what I chose I
3:49 did my bachelor's in Romania and then I
3:52 moved to Germany for my masters and my
3:55 monsters and I wanted to do research I
3:58 wanted to do things that I knew that
4:00 could not be done in Romania at the time
4:03 the industry did not support that kind
4:05 of Direction so I decided to do a master
4:07 in research at maxpunk Germany and then
4:09 take it from there
4:11 so this is Kinder was my journey I loved
4:15 that I recommend to anyone studying at
4:18 Max blank it's like a mini Google and
4:20 with high imposter syndrome
4:23 um
4:24 but um yeah I did one year and a half of
4:27 PhD after that and I realized that this
4:29 doesn't make me think the teaching does
4:31 and the students do the classes do but I
4:35 like to work in something that has
4:37 impact in the real world and I felt like
4:39 the PHD was not really connected to it
4:42 so that's how I landed up in Berlin
4:45 um I I started with a very generic role
4:50 as a data consultant or engineer and
4:53 then moved slowly and slowly towards
4:56 data all in all four years where I
4:59 reached the role of a bi manager
5:02 and um
5:04 I was disappointed about the layoffs in
5:06 that year that davanda also had layoffs
5:09 that year
5:09 and I remember okay let's change the
5:11 city so or the scene a little bit so
5:14 that's why I took an offer from Google
5:15 and I moved to Munich I was working in
5:19 the advertising Department in Publishers
5:21 on a technical ladder taking care of
5:24 really large clients for for Google
5:27 um
5:28 what else can I say the normal job nine
5:31 to five that we will never really get
5:32 promoted sorry for that
5:35 um so you have to find other projects
5:37 that are kind of aligned with your
5:39 strengths and skills and I chose data
5:42 data logs data and the models and
5:44 forecasting if you do this then you get
5:47 more money of that
5:49 um so this is this is how I got into the
5:52 whole workflows and pipelines and this
5:55 was like my most love my my most coolest
5:59 project back then
6:02 um then I moved to San Francisco because
6:04 I I really wanted to report to a female
6:06 manager that still is just here still
6:09 that works there in that org they were
6:10 not many female managers anyway
6:13 so that was uh at Google right yeah yeah
6:16 yeah
6:17 um in the German offices I don't
6:19 remember female managers but in
6:22 in the San Francisco office there was
6:24 and I was I have to say this because I
6:27 think this is very important due to the
6:28 the percentage of women that are in Tech
6:31 I will report it to a woman manager for
6:34 the first time at age 32.
6:37 I was working in a team where there were
6:39 something else that men at age 32.
6:44 so we know that we have some gender gap
6:47 there in presence in Germany
6:50 um I'm not going to continue more with
6:52 Google and network on other roles and
6:54 some research papers and I moved from by
6:56 side and sales side I wanted to know as
6:57 much as possible that I could get from
6:59 this particular org add Cloud on top of
7:02 it and then I left Google and kind of
7:05 merged all my worlds in one and from
7:08 there on
7:09 I worked in the Netherlands as a
7:11 consultant and then I started again the
7:13 managing path
7:15 actually my first team I managed was a
7:17 team of data engineers and I really
7:18 liked them because they had to stand up
7:20 early and I love a good artist and
7:23 yeah and since the year I'm back in
7:25 Berlin
7:26 I'm a manager of analytics but I can
7:29 also do data engineering so I can wear
7:31 very many hats and as I mentioned I
7:34 really liked teaching during my PhD and
7:36 this is something that I kept investing
7:39 in
7:40 all the time after after I left I mean
7:42 that means going back to Romania to my
7:45 computer science high school and telling
7:46 kids what they can do with it and
7:48 encourage women to study or
7:52 um becoming a part of the first
7:54 something like a lean in group of 12
7:57 years ago in Berlin
7:59 but when I got really serious about it
8:02 when my brother moved in with me which
8:04 is 11 10 11 years ago
8:06 and then he saw that I was so happy with
8:08 my job it's like what do you do Elena I
8:10 don't know what you do he's study
8:12 marketing it's like then how do you come
8:14 happy after work what's what's that I
8:16 want to I want to be part of it so um
8:19 yeah we he was my first student
8:22 and it was pretty successful I would say
8:26 and that made me kind of enroll myself
8:30 as a mentor in other programs as well to
8:33 your brother he was doing marketing and
8:36 he wanted to get sorry he was also doing
8:39 a lot of things like IP support he's
8:42 also a nerd but in his own way more on a
8:44 hardware part so he was doing marketing
8:46 and a lot of other stuff and he saw uh
8:49 this world of data and you helped him
8:54 helped him to get in data right
8:57 databases queries in that and then he
9:00 started working as a data analyst or
9:02 data
9:04 scientists I'm so so proud of him
9:07 because he said like I have experience
9:08 as an idea support and I want to go into
9:10 bi you have two internships in both of
9:13 these areas give them to me both and you
9:15 I will convince you to to roll me to a
9:18 full time I'm so proud of his sass so
9:21 you know requires courage and he did a
9:24 great job so they hired him and now you
9:26 know the rest is history because he's
9:28 doing great and you like the process of
9:32 Mandarin people
9:35 I understand how people think like for
9:37 me it was for teaching him it was a
9:41 visual way of teaching him like I was
9:42 trying to explain to him tables and
9:44 databases and how do you do
9:46 um connections between the moderns and
9:48 aggregation how to imagine yourself that
9:50 it's kind of collapsing when you have a
9:52 window function
9:53 yeah that's the most difficult concept
9:55 I'm still struggling with that one I
9:58 like to go and then explain like if you
10:00 do this
10:02 and some other people are not
10:04 necessarily visual visuals you have to
10:06 find other ways and it's
10:07 it is so interesting to understand them
10:10 how they understand the problem so that
10:12 you can explain to them in a medium it's
10:15 the best for them so whether you know
10:17 some people like to study alone and work
10:20 with you so
10:22 um yeah so this is kind of where it all
10:24 started within Google I was part of the
10:27 official mentoring
10:28 um areas as in like the Anita box
10:31 scholarship recipients from Eastern
10:33 Europe groups where we had again like a
10:36 really cool project and the winning
10:38 ladies have they have created actually
10:41 two ngos that have also volunteered for
10:43 from time to time
10:45 um I've also in the US because it was
10:48 easy due to the language to Mentor
10:51 um I worked with kids I worked with the
10:53 veteran soon to be veteran going towards
10:57 data
10:58 teaching kids to code with blockly and
11:01 all the the logic loops
11:03 and coming back to Europe I discovered
11:06 the Berlin mentoring club which I
11:08 thought was great both for me as like
11:10 sometimes I also need advice so I find
11:12 people to help me there too
11:15 um
11:17 yeah and that's that's one kind of I'm
11:19 focused more on like I'm teaching you
11:21 how to be how to
11:23 be your data analyst how to enter the
11:25 data field of course women prefer women
11:27 and they're not many women in data so
11:29 they are mentors so yeah that's a it's a
11:32 it's a lot of requests
11:34 and um then um
11:37 yeah I managed I I got into the boot
11:39 camps in Berlin and I started analyzing
11:41 a little bit at the market because I
11:43 hired some analysts from two different
11:44 schools and I saw some some patterns as
11:48 in you know they learned this beautiful
11:49 code and they learn modeling but they
11:51 don't know some of the business the gut
11:54 feeling in business
11:56 um so that's how I looked and analyze
11:57 that part and discovered Brown Loop and
12:00 I'm absolutely in love with their
12:01 Community because it's so positive and
12:04 also the fact that it's not not for
12:06 profit allows just a different
12:09 more flexibility more
12:12 um
12:13 more freedom in the curriculum more tips
12:16 more stories from my own experience when
12:19 somebody needs extra help
12:22 um and the summer I was all uh designed
12:25 a curriculum together with a couple of
12:26 people at AI Guild and
12:29 um what fraud fraud detection and
12:31 chargeback as well
12:34 fancy class it's actually one of the
12:37 questions I uh I have about that so in
12:42 your LinkedIn
12:43 um you have this experience with AI
12:45 Guild that you mentioned and the title
12:48 that you have for this for this job is
12:51 program manager so responsibilities
12:53 according to your profile is designing
12:55 the fintech data science curriculum
12:57 collecting market Standard practices
13:00 data sets and exercises per topic and
13:03 finding teachers so yeah I was I got
13:05 really curious because we also in data
13:07 talks Club also do courses
13:10 and yeah this is something I I also need
13:13 to do often so I really wanted to ask
13:16 you more about this uh and uh I I'll
13:20 write my employer was the idea that that
13:22 Daniel and Chris I don't know it's a
13:24 small community we know each other
13:27 um yeah it was
13:30 I mean first I was I think I was asked
13:32 to be a teacher and I I said I had a lot
13:34 of ideas about the the program itself
13:36 and how one can update a little bit the
13:39 curriculum to make it a bit more modern
13:42 and that's all I got to work together
13:44 with Daniel on this and then um I got
13:47 inspired that maybe we should have some
13:49 Google certification or Cloud
13:51 certifications if we work in bigquery
13:53 and do anything data related we might as
13:56 well get some certifications for those
13:58 students so you know putting my
14:00 connections at Google and got them
14:02 access to this um there is a learning
14:04 platform that if you are a Google
14:05 customer you can have access to it
14:08 so now on top of everything the students
14:11 also get certification so I think that's
14:13 pretty unique
14:15 um in in that sense
14:16 and
14:18 you know what what other questions would
14:20 you have around yeah the question was uh
14:22 yeah you actually didn't answer that yet
14:25 um
14:25 so you said you be asked you AI Guild
14:29 asked you to join them as a teacher but
14:31 you were more interested in uh
14:35 you did both okay
14:38 and I'm I'm really curious um like what
14:41 does it mean what does it mean to design
14:44 a curriculum what what did you do there
14:46 exactly so this I didn't alone it was
14:50 also done yeah right credit credit is
14:52 due so you plural I guess
14:55 happy
14:56 um we we first of all we I well here I I
15:01 was interviewing Financial techies so
15:04 managers of data in fintech companies or
15:09 in fintech departments or in fraud
15:11 departments what kind of methodologies
15:13 they have implemented in their
15:16 um in their teams and if this is an
15:20 exhaustive list and I came up with the
15:21 list like money laundering identity
15:23 theft so on identity management and so
15:27 on and so forth then I audited some
15:30 Coursera classes and see what is the
15:32 fraud class because there are classes on
15:34 fraud massive massive classes like it
15:38 could be a semester but just to glean a
15:40 couple of Concepts from them
15:43 um so as I said the specifically
15:45 curriculum was fintech and after getting
15:48 the the high level topics uh we decided
15:52 to spend maybe a couple of days on each
15:54 topic find the data sets that would
15:56 support it
15:58 um think of complexity trying ourselves
16:00 to actually recode with the problems
16:03 ourselves before uh before
16:07 putting out the curriculum because what
16:09 if it's too hard right I need to like as
16:12 a manager I need to understand the
16:13 internships piece you know like I have
16:16 to work that that part
16:19 um and we had also
16:20 so that this curriculum was
16:22 um it's a company that wanted to have it
16:25 to hire these people and we thought like
16:28 well since the company is paying for
16:30 this pilot we could have also like add
16:33 Cloud certification on top
16:36 um add a little bit of some business
16:38 knowledge or notes related to why we are
16:41 doing these types of models
16:43 um with lots of examples like what does
16:45 it mean in Commerce what does it mean
16:47 dating what does it mean in
16:48 SAS and so on
16:51 and um
16:53 I'm thinking like technical skills
16:56 related to MLM production would be like
16:59 some um parts of that curriculum and
17:02 then alternated with the data science
17:03 part
17:05 um
17:07 we also thought that it would be
17:10 probably really good to give the
17:11 students more business understanding so
17:14 things like skills this is something
17:16 that it is so forgotten in our
17:20 data-driven world data analysts need
17:23 soft skills me presentation skills
17:26 storytelling
17:27 um
17:29 slide design all of that so light design
17:33 so even that
17:36 you know what I think at the end of the
17:38 day all of us even if we are we are
17:40 techies we're also sales people we sell
17:42 and we appreciate in every single
17:43 interaction we need to do that better
17:45 you know
17:48 um so in my masters at Max blog I had a
17:51 coordinator
17:52 a female
17:53 the program coordinator who taught us as
17:56 well technical writing and soft skills
17:58 it's used to feel much excuse to tell us
18:01 like please if you cannot actually this
18:04 was part of the pitch to get a PhD tell
18:07 the topic of your thesis in an elevator
18:09 pitch and if you can convince me
18:12 then you get it
18:14 uh so and then you get to film yourself
18:16 to see your body language what how does
18:19 your face look like do you look at the
18:20 audience do you know do you time
18:22 yourself so we also we thought
18:24 can be a really cool idea to bring and
18:27 you do this in uh with AI Guild 2 for
18:30 their course did you yeah I got I found
18:33 somebody through yeah
18:35 that's cool
18:37 finding teachers like who could teach I
18:40 also like Max Planck network has all of
18:43 these AI teachers at Castle platner
18:46 Institute right so you can also ask them
18:48 they also have teaching the industry
18:49 classes if they're available
18:53 um then like if you look at data
18:54 storytelling and what kind of
18:56 Consultants offer your services on that
18:58 they're not very many there's there's
19:01 very few people and I think the most
19:03 prominent of them was one in the
19:05 Netherlands and a couple of them in U.S
19:07 but not here in Germany
19:09 so that's why it's really hard to find
19:12 the teachers on that
19:15 uh they apparently the students said
19:16 that they liked the class very much they
19:18 never expected to get such a training
19:21 yeah I guess it's not what you by
19:23 default expect from a data analytics or
19:26 any data course right so you expect
19:28 technical skills you don't expect uh you
19:31 know not a designer slide but it's
19:33 important of course Very vital yeah of
19:35 course how do you pitch your own idea
19:37 how do you
19:38 mean
19:40 um
19:43 yeah and the cloud part was an idea
19:45 because
19:46 um
19:47 I I follow this guy from
19:50 Microsoft he designs ml exercises writes
19:55 ml books and uh very active and he was
19:59 commenting how
20:01 current universities are a little bit
20:03 behind technology and we're not going to
20:06 find a class in cloud in a specific I
20:08 don't know what the MIT maybe maybe you
20:11 do what MIT or Stanford I don't know but
20:13 in general you can you don't find the
20:16 practices of the real world being taught
20:18 in universities
20:19 so he I just posted something about a
20:22 an American boot camp that said like we
20:25 have the trifecta cloud data science and
20:27 I don't know what which was a very
20:29 modern ml in production it was like yeah
20:32 that's where we want to go well I guess
20:34 uh if you're in a if you're MIT and you
20:38 need to design a course it will take I
20:40 don't know a couple of years and then by
20:43 the time you do this I don't know AWS or
20:46 Google Cloud are already different maybe
20:48 they don't have these services that they
20:50 used to have two years ago and they have
20:52 something else and then it means like
20:53 you need to redo the whole thing and the
20:55 UI has changed all the places yeah
20:57 information yes that's why I guess the
21:00 university is like more classicals
21:03 universities there always behind with
21:05 these things because they're more
21:07 reactive they catch up to the market
21:09 and how do you convince somebody
21:11 somebody who can teach you those things
21:14 or a university might be expensive
21:16 things maybe
21:19 so your role as a program manager was to
21:24 come like to design a curriculum and
21:26 what it what it means is
21:28 come up with a course plan right what
21:31 are the modules there what are the units
21:33 there and underneath what data sets we
21:36 could have what could we do as an
21:38 exercise so you have insurance that
21:40 means you have scoring how do you do
21:41 scoring how do you find the data candle
21:44 is amazing God bless it has a lot of
21:47 very good things so first you talk to
21:50 Managers from different fintech
21:53 companies who work with data yeah so you
21:55 collected some idea from them then we
21:57 formed the curriculum like a list of
21:58 topics you need to cover then you
22:01 understood what exactly you need to
22:03 cover there what kind of data sets you
22:04 could use and then you found teachers
22:06 for each of the modules that's the
22:09 process
22:10 okay did you teach anything yourself
22:12 yeah any of these models
22:15 okay um
22:17 fraud detection as a rule based once one
22:21 example and the other was the neural
22:23 networks or chargeback detection and I
22:26 was trying to explain to them that to
22:28 the students that poor fraud you have a
22:30 lot of signals and that's why you can
22:31 use something else or you can even use
22:33 rule base you have a lot of information
22:36 we can discuss also about fraud changes
22:38 fraud methodologies change every day so
22:40 if you have an ml model you have to
22:42 train it every week that's another
22:44 cattle of fish and
22:46 um on chargeback you don't have as much
22:49 information because there was diesel
22:51 conversations with the students like
22:53 think how does it happen what does
22:54 what's the process how many signals how
22:57 many signals does the e-commerce see how
22:59 many signals does the bank applications
23:00 use well then if you don't have signals
23:03 and you don't there's nothing really
23:04 that triggers it that's in within your
23:06 power or in your tracking then yeah
23:09 neural networks because I I don't I
23:11 don't know what else could though and
23:13 I'm sure there's other models as well
23:15 that could do better you know of course
23:17 we're not not only talking about data
23:19 sets but how do you create your feature
23:21 vectors and how
23:23 um what are common standard practices uh
23:26 to create that
23:28 from experience from Theory it was more
23:31 data science then yeah I thought data
23:34 science Bitcoin data science
23:36 it's the sometimes the lines between
23:38 what data analytics and what data
23:40 science are maybe the lines are a bit
23:43 blurry I'm happy to impress those
23:45 definitions because I also teach them a
23:46 little bit but what do you describe to
23:49 me sounds like data science application
23:50 of machine learning to a particular
23:51 domain
23:53 data scientists
23:55 okay and so data sets so you talk to
23:59 this uh domain experts managers right so
24:03 yeah because I can look into a class I
24:05 can look into a book I can look online
24:06 on floor and the categories for it but
24:09 that's not a direct view of how it is
24:12 actually used in industry and it's if
24:14 you have friends in Industry invite them
24:15 for a coffee and ask them have you
24:17 implemented that it's good to know
24:20 um what's possible to do and what the
24:22 standards are so this is in your
24:25 description of the job you were doing it
24:28 was collecting market Standard practices
24:31 this is what you mean by that talking to
24:33 people with myself but this is what I
24:35 did here okay okay yeah that's uh that
24:38 makes perfect sense it's very concise
24:41 but dense and then like we can talk
24:45 about each of these words or phrases for
24:48 the entire uh interview I guess yeah
24:52 that that that's quite interesting
24:54 um so you worked as a data analyst he
24:56 worked as a bi manager data Activision
24:58 activation specialist the eye manager
25:00 again sorry at Google I was a technical
25:04 account manager technical account
25:06 manager General umbrella term actually
25:08 like solution consultant it's an
25:10 umbrella term that actually
25:12 could see every single
25:14 title that I had
25:18 and now you're a teacher right so you
25:21 you have like all this feature but I'm
25:24 also a manager of analytics during the
25:26 day yeah so you have a full-time job
25:30 well I've been
25:35 yeah because so what I wanted to ask you
25:36 is like whether you're teaching
25:38 full-time but I guess the answer is no
25:40 or you have full two full-time jobs
25:43 I uh I don't have kids right so yeah
25:46 freedom
25:49 um I think
25:51 depends very much like what I feel that
25:55 I can
25:56 support the community most with but also
26:01 being very mindful of my own energy as
26:04 well so for example if I start a new job
26:06 I'm not going to teach in the first one
26:07 month or two because it's too much it's
26:10 overwhelming
26:11 um
26:12 I would not be a full-time teacher
26:15 because I really love building things I
26:16 really like the idea of business and
26:18 moving the needle and
26:21 um how many how engaging it is I I like
26:25 the the friction in a normal management
26:27 job and teaching people there as well
26:31 I also can say that sometimes I'm so
26:33 positively surprised at the momentees or
26:36 the students that I'm teaching that
26:37 might be even better than my own team or
26:40 one single analyst it's it's fascinating
26:43 to see like how just different
26:45 personalities and different
26:47 speeds of desire to acquire new
26:50 knowledge and I can explain as well like
26:53 frown Loop I started as well this year
26:56 um first as a more of an SQL teacher but
26:59 we also looked into
27:01 how we could update the curriculum with
27:03 a few more modern uh Concepts like for
27:07 example I had students or I had analysts
27:09 reporting to me coming out of the boot
27:11 camp I didn't know what the cohort
27:12 analysis is or churn or retention so the
27:15 business kpis
27:17 so we could also do that but from one
27:20 Loop
27:21 and then because you're an NGO you know
27:23 you don't have it's really hard to to
27:25 bring Tech to own tech tech stack on
27:28 which you can teach
27:30 and I offered the opportunity to some of
27:33 the students if they want to to work in
27:35 my cloud instance or from thrown up on
27:37 my data sets they can
27:39 practice whatever they want their SQL or
27:42 other things or some bigquery ml so why
27:46 not you can write it directly in a query
27:49 so
27:51 yeah kind of also both clouds too found
27:53 Loop oh sorry so
27:56 people get scared of it it's like oh my
27:58 God it must be so something so big and
28:01 complex Google cloud or any other Cloud
28:03 solution and then you show them like
28:05 actually
28:06 it's really not I'm only showing one
28:09 part which is easy I'm not going to
28:10 complex the five things I mean um to be
28:13 frank if I look at Google Cloud
28:15 interface it's so much simpler than some
28:18 of the other clouds I mean I use it to
28:20 AWS at work and everybody who's an
28:23 engineer is AWS yeah yeah and then if I
28:26 look at Google Cloud then some things
28:28 are much more straightforward there I
28:32 mean you kind of know how to find stuff
28:35 which is there
28:38 I mean not everything but sometimes it's
28:41 some things are a bit easier there
28:44 but I see I also see that in students
28:47 the this um
28:48 I don't know if fear is the right word
28:52 I would say reluctant maybe to learn
28:56 Cloud because this is something big and
28:58 scary
29:00 and you don't need to learn the entire
29:02 clock well I don't know if you can say
29:04 entire Cloud but like all the AWS all
29:07 the Google Cloud right so that there's
29:08 one piece of that that you just can
29:11 focus on and that's enough yeah
29:14 right
29:15 at the beginning of the year I was doing
29:17 a Greenfield assignment so I arrived
29:19 from scratch and built a data warehouse
29:22 from scratch
29:23 and um
29:25 I mean as long as the data sources are
29:27 pretty simple and we don't have a
29:28 complex data ecosystem
29:31 hey it's very easy to build pipelines
29:33 really it's not it's not rocket science
29:37 [Music]
29:38 yeah that was also really cool I like
29:41 building things so I I don't think I
29:42 could do just one job I need to have a
29:45 mix of things that always kind of excite
29:48 me and bring new ideas
29:50 which for you is I guess a manager
29:55 right so as you are a manager and then
29:57 if you manage analysts you need to get
30:00 into analytics if you manage data
30:01 Engineers you need to go to get into
30:03 pipeline building engineering and then
30:06 if you manage both you kind of need to
30:08 get into both right yeah and product
30:10 analytics and product Analytics
30:14 um architect maybe less nml engineer as
30:18 well
30:20 yeah it's hard
30:22 and then you also teach right yes but
30:25 for example like I had an ml engineer
30:28 bless his heart really talented I think
30:30 one day we'll read about him in the news
30:33 and um and yeah I cannot understand
30:36 everything that he does I read a little
30:38 bit but I feel like I'm behind of course
30:40 on some areas
30:42 um that doesn't mean that it makes you a
30:45 better or worse manager
30:46 if you conceptually understand things
30:50 if you conceptually understand an able
30:52 test how to do it you're not going to do
30:53 the distribution of the results as well
30:56 but again it's for each
30:58 to each their own so yeah you need to
31:00 because otherwise you cannot especially
31:02 with the engineers and especially as a
31:04 woman I feel that I need to prove that
31:06 I'm technically serving maybe more than
31:09 your usual
31:12 that's that's my own uh
31:17 you mentioned one thing so you were
31:20 working with somebody who didn't know
31:22 what cohort analytics is or what churn
31:25 is I'm really wondering like because I
31:28 must admit I don't also know what
31:30 exactly is cohort analytic analytics
31:33 maybe you can give like a visual so
31:36 let's imagine that you uh
31:40 let's talk about a game like online
31:42 gaming Pokemon Diablo I play the album I
31:46 love them which one first second uh
31:50 first second I've exhausted them to the
31:52 end together with my brother in a
31:53 private land in our block of flats in
31:55 Romania but now I'm playing The Immortal
31:57 the online version okay let me cross
32:00 good memories but imagine that you have
32:04 you know you're launching uh you're
32:05 launching a game and you know that there
32:07 are parts of the game that are in
32:08 different sets of betas or maybe you
32:10 don't have as many Journeys
32:12 and depending on what users find in that
32:15 game they're more or less active if they
32:18 find the things that interest them
32:20 so
32:21 you want to know you want to actually
32:23 you as a product manager of a gamer
32:26 owner of a game what you want is that
32:29 you users spend as much time on your
32:31 platform so you're interested that they
32:33 return and that they return after the
32:35 first month and second month and you
32:37 want a long relationship with that
32:38 client
32:39 I'm trying to explain kind of how the
32:42 cohort analysis will look so imagine
32:45 that in the first month of launch you
32:47 have people
32:49 you know being super active because it
32:51 just launched and everyone wants to try
32:53 it and the servers are super busy and
32:55 everybody the engineers focus on that
32:57 and not on new maps and new challenges
33:01 and as a result let's say that you might
33:03 have to to initial hype about two three
33:06 months they don't return because there's
33:08 not enough complexity in the game now
33:10 the PM says well now I have more time to
33:13 think about it for the extra things I
33:15 can bring in the game so let's make it
33:16 longer let's make it more complex but
33:18 make it more social more challenges and
33:21 the next set of users that sign up and
33:25 start playing the game have a different
33:26 experience than the first ones and as a
33:29 result they have a different behavior
33:30 and as a result they have a different
33:32 way of coming back or they come back for
33:34 things at the first group did not
33:37 so
33:38 the way you do you take these account
33:41 the users to join in the first month and
33:43 in the second month
33:45 and then you calculate how many percent
33:46 how much percentage of that first group
33:48 returns a second course and so on and if
33:52 you do it with a very nice visual you
33:56 will see like a degra day of color and
33:58 how that retention co-part analysis
34:00 looks like the retention rates
34:03 the cohort here is not a cluster it's
34:06 something else exactly okay because what
34:08 I thought cohort analysis is like you
34:10 have different clusters of users and
34:12 then you somehow like you have different
34:14 profiles different personas you can use
34:17 it for
34:18 the same month different users or you
34:21 can like IB test right you want to see
34:23 if maybe test has impacted something or
34:25 maybe you have users who see or engage
34:28 with ads to get credits and users should
34:31 don't know who hate ads like me
34:34 so you can also create two cohorts and
34:37 look at the
34:38 let's say at the
34:41 noted retention rate or maybe
34:43 monetization rate or something else
34:45 related to that behavior being exposed
34:48 to to something
34:49 so it can be chronological like month
34:52 after month after month or it can be at
34:54 the same time and more of it as a like
34:56 group Persona comparisons
34:59 yeah why not
35:01 yeah yeah thanks
35:05 um so I'm really curious how did you
35:07 start with so you said you monitored
35:09 your brother right and then you liked it
35:12 but how did you start
35:14 maybe doing this more formally so you
35:17 also you did this with AI Guild you are
35:20 doing this with throwing Loop so how did
35:22 you find these companies how did you
35:24 start mentoring with them how did it
35:26 happen to you
35:28 yeah it happened actually it just
35:30 happened like was it intentional from
35:32 your side or did it just happened with
35:34 the ideal it really happened I got an
35:36 email from Chris like hey we saw your
35:37 profile video you are fainted your data
35:39 science you need ideal come teach for us
35:42 well it didn't just happen they reached
35:45 out they reached out
35:47 but you didn't you didn't actively you
35:51 know do anything you just give yourself
35:54 and then they reached out yeah yeah I
35:56 think they were reaching out to
35:59 data Specialists who were working in
36:01 print at the point or had like a long
36:04 extensive experience of
36:06 marketing data all sorts of data
36:11 and yeah I told Chris hey I actually
36:13 have more time than just this if you
36:15 want so we should we could build more
36:17 and um that worked with Frau and loop
36:21 um
36:22 I keep here I kept I kept hearing about
36:25 the energy offers from so many people
36:27 and then um one of my hires in spring in
36:32 sorry in January this year was from um
36:36 a graduate of Throne Loop
36:39 and um
36:41 yeah she kept saying so many good things
36:43 about it that I decided to join like hey
36:45 can I offer you my services as meant as
36:48 a mentor or teacher I would love to I
36:51 have some extra time if you need that
36:53 and apparently came at the right time
36:55 because there was a need to Mentor so
36:58 started right away
37:01 um
37:05 if you've ever been
37:07 I mean I think some this is something
37:09 that you for you as a gender is harder
37:11 to understand but I've been at
37:12 conferences where they're only women or
37:14 being to classes with they're only women
37:17 it has a different plan
37:19 it's a bit more jolly it's a bit more
37:21 relaxed it's it's really nice you can
37:23 discuss more honestly as well like hey
37:26 you are selling yourself short you want
37:28 to have apologized for something 10
37:30 times and I'm gonna put a an apology jar
37:32 and I'm gonna make you buy coffee or
37:34 chocolate because you don't need to
37:36 apologize this much this is not
37:38 reason to apologies which is just Tech
37:41 work
37:42 so it allows for more
37:45 more connection and more honest
37:48 um conversations as well like don't do
37:50 that don't do that when you interviewed
37:53 trust me that that's not uh it's not how
37:56 you should approach things
37:58 [Music]
37:58 um
37:59 yeah and I hope for a long
38:01 collaborations I mean where we're always
38:04 thinking of things
38:07 and from what I know mostly from Johanna
38:09 who talked to you before this interview
38:12 uh she mentioned that you work on some
38:15 projects Where You Are
38:18 looking into the diversity gender
38:21 diversity in the companies
38:24 it's not just me it's a group of people
38:27 yeah yeah it would be you as a part of
38:29 larger group
38:31 um
38:33 really beginning so we're just we're
38:35 just like
38:37 excited but at the beginning
38:40 does it mean that you're not ready to
38:43 talk about the initiatives you had
38:45 because they are not concrete yet or uh
38:48 yeah I mean they're not they're the
38:51 signatures are official but yeah I would
38:54 like to to keep things on the wraps just
38:56 a few more until we get the first change
38:58 it's not some
39:03 crazy new idea at all it's all about
39:06 how do you like data engineering
39:08 question because I've been thinking
39:09 about this um like grabbing LinkedIn
39:11 data or Glassdoor data and analyzing it
39:14 to see if I find things and as a data
39:16 engineer I was looking into how I can
39:18 get this data and what are the right I
39:20 need a developer account I need to pay
39:22 for this so I need to have IPS to scrape
39:24 things
39:26 um so it took a long time to find
39:28 official Solutions because
39:30 I mean I'm a data manager I'm a data
39:33 teacher there's also the concept of data
39:36 governance and legalities and you cannot
39:40 use for research information that is not
39:43 publicly available or if you have
39:45 manipulated right to get
39:49 so this also what's a problem to
39:50 overcome right otherwise everyone can
39:53 say how to develop something
39:56 it has to be respectfully done
39:58 and legally done as well I mean I would
40:02 love to to do research on choir with
40:04 like lean and stuff I would really like
40:08 because I think they're
40:09 uh there are so many pitfalls
40:13 and we don't know as women whether we
40:15 you know every time we take a job
40:17 whether we're gonna work in a team with
40:19 other women or not we're going to be the
40:21 only woman in the team sometimes being
40:23 the only woman in the team is not easy
40:27 so hopefully we start work we can see
40:30 where companies that are open to
40:33 um diversity and that the diversity is
40:35 not at the lower level only but at a
40:37 higher level it shows you that you know
40:39 I have a model there who can stand out
40:42 for me like managers right you mentioned
40:44 your first female manager was that when
40:47 he was I was 32. yeah that's uh insane
40:53 I don't know now you had to move to
40:56 another country right
40:57 to have this experience
41:11 I only remember the project
41:14 that's all
41:16 yeah since uh these projects that you
41:18 mentioned there at the Inception stage
41:21 yet so now well like there's nothing
41:24 concrete but
41:26 um so we have a course a datadox club we
41:28 have a course about data engineering and
41:31 it looks to me that 95 of the students
41:35 or roughly it feels like they're males
41:38 not females so only a small fraction of
41:41 the students are females
41:43 and maybe you can
41:46 if ask a few suggestions like how can we
41:49 make it more interesting more attractive
41:51 for females to also join our course and
41:54 this is a free course like how can we
41:57 can attract more females more students
42:00 to join the course so the marketing we
42:02 did so far was we just posted on Reddit
42:04 we post it on I don't know Twitter
42:06 LinkedIn people come that's pretty much
42:09 the extent of uh
42:12 uh zero I guess it's like I mean
42:16 it's like the super toxic website right
42:19 because it's anonymous
42:23 sometimes fire sometimes yeah I I am as
42:28 a parenthesis I love the MIB
42:30 section
42:32 because I always laugh when I read
42:35 things from there which is yeah how else
42:38 can you advertise you can put posters in
42:40 universities you can
42:43 um
42:45 but maybe like not General advertising
42:47 but like how to make it more attractive
42:49 for females because I guess if I put if
42:52 we go and put this in university stand
42:54 again
42:55 um no it has to be more more targeted
42:59 like maybe um groups like Pi ladies
43:01 could be him
43:03 my ladies would be one I think there's a
43:06 lot of fear of data engineering to be
43:08 honest and that's that's a problem
43:11 um of sign ups
43:15 um
43:16 let me give me 30 seconds to brainstorm
43:19 yeah you were not prepared for that so
43:22 that was not a part of it
43:29 there are this great organizations like
43:31 correlate
43:33 um citizens for Europe they also offer
43:35 classes maybe you can offer classes to
43:38 the volunteers thereof so that they can
43:41 upskill because uh I've been to a couple
43:44 of hackathons where we had hard time on
43:46 the data engineering part not from the
43:47 statistical part and there were very few
43:50 people with data engineering experience
43:52 um I can think of Alan karnish was the
43:55 only only female and the only data
43:57 Engineer Expert in the room
44:01 um so it can be yeah can be training to
44:04 volunteers who go at these cool things
44:06 and hackathons
44:09 um
44:09 because also these organizations as far
44:13 as I've seen have an equal
44:14 representational slightly equal of
44:16 genders surprisingly I saw men hacking
44:20 for diversity at corner Lane which is
44:22 cool
44:23 [Music]
44:23 um
44:27 I mean women have different like they
44:29 have a bit of a different obstacle than
44:31 the guys in in what means who is your
44:35 target audience do you want to Target
44:36 the moms moms are the hardest to find
44:39 time to learn something so you have to
44:40 do classes in the evening
44:43 if you want to Target uh PhD students
44:45 then you can give this class to and
44:48 advertise it through I don't know alumni
44:51 or Max plan or programs or
44:55 um
44:56 I'm sure for example it can be
44:59 complementary to
45:03 refugees as well I mean this could be
45:06 also things to I don't know just let me
45:09 know I'm somebody great ideas I always
45:11 have you know do you know the
45:15 um
45:16 the gallop the strengths finder test
45:19 yeah
45:20 my number one is the theater
45:23 I realized that maybe if you come up
45:27 with great ideas please do share it them
45:29 with me but I realized that we have six
45:32 questions in slider and we should cover
45:34 them too yes absolutely so uh the first
45:37 question the most supported one is how
45:40 can I get technical feedback on my
45:42 deliverables at work my manager either
45:44 don't have the technical skill or time
45:46 for code review or discussing data
45:48 modeling
45:50 right
45:51 um I would say in that case even
45:55 you have to make aware of your manager
45:57 that both your work quality and
45:59 happiness would benefit from this and if
46:01 the team doesn't have implemented
46:03 processes for code reviews or particular
46:06 views would you just say it like that my
46:08 happiness depends on feedback like you
46:09 would be upfront about that without you
46:12 know trying to say it in any other way
46:15 oh I'm giving large advice the first
46:18 thing that I would do if somebody is
46:20 very sad about this and really wants to
46:21 have code reviews is find things
46:23 internally don't describe you don't need
46:26 to for this
46:28 um your the purpose of getting technical
46:31 feedback or reviews of ml models
46:34 um has a is very vital for the company
46:37 so yes somebody should take a look on
46:40 your code
46:41 I I would not as your manager I would
46:43 not let your code go live without
46:45 somebody else seeing it because it's
46:46 important
46:47 so if you do not have peers in the
46:50 analytics team there can be peers in the
46:52 engineering team that can give you
46:53 feedback on the engineering part of the
46:55 work or there can be a financial analyst
46:59 who can give you uh some feedback on the
47:02 logic that you have approached
47:05 um if you are lucky and work for a
47:07 stakeholder who's technical they can
47:09 also maybe replicate in work what can be
47:13 the stakeholder could be the reviewer as
47:15 well
47:17 and for example the the ml engineer
47:20 cannot go to a code review to an analyst
47:23 so they still need to go to an another
47:25 engineer
47:26 format setup so I highly encourage that
47:30 first of all
47:32 um you know convince the men you know
47:34 convince the managers something that
47:36 they can be solving by themselves find
47:38 the right person talk to more people
47:40 um Engineers love to help these with
47:42 these things
47:44 I I don't I don't have any other
47:46 experience that this is this will be
47:48 appreciated and any flexibility around
47:51 these approaches will also be
47:53 appreciated
47:54 if you don't find any resources within
47:57 your company then it's tougher because
47:59 ml models or other information can be
48:02 very proprietary to the company and you
48:04 cannot share outside please don't
48:07 but then you can find other data and
48:10 kind of have a similar approach and kind
48:12 of have a similar code but please don't
48:14 share it because people get fired if
48:16 they do like don't share company code on
48:19 Reddit right
48:22 um just code it again
48:24 and ask a community maybe that you're
48:27 part of yeah
48:30 and yeah speaking of this discussing
48:32 data modeling I guess in situations when
48:34 your manager doesn't have the skill then
48:36 It's Tricky but uh maybe some other
48:40 people do have time so for example in in
48:43 our company when somebody wants to
48:46 discuss like data modeling or
48:47 architecture or something and they come
48:49 to me I'm super happy like again I will
48:52 be glad to put everything I work on yeah
48:54 Maybe not immediately but like finish it
48:56 wrap it up for the day and then tomorrow
48:58 be ready to discuss this thing because
49:00 it's much more exciting than I usually
49:02 do in my day-to-day work
49:06 [Music]
49:06 um
49:08 like you know this Green Field like data
49:11 modeling or like it means that you're
49:12 probably starting something in you right
49:14 that you need to come up with a right
49:16 model for that or write architecture
49:18 write something
49:19 when somebody starts explaining you this
49:22 like how you have approached thing they
49:24 also have a light bulb moment the
49:25 process of explaining something and
49:27 taking it out of your head and putting
49:29 it in words or
49:30 on paper helps you clarify things too
49:34 and actually this is one of the benefits
49:36 of mentoring too
49:38 okay yeah
49:39 it's another question what are the top
49:41 five overrated things anti-patterns and
49:45 waste of productivity for people who
49:47 learn data analytics
49:50 don't learn models if you don't apply
49:52 anything
49:54 and by models you mean
49:56 predictive ml don't don't learn ml if
50:00 you don't have a project for it
50:02 stuff like don't this is something I see
50:05 a lot oh but also
50:08 over engineering I call it a little bit
50:10 of over engineering
50:15 so one
50:17 as uh I'm gonna I'm trying to kind of
50:21 like bullet point my answers so on one
50:24 hand is uh too much ml hype without
50:27 being fully aware if that is necessary
50:30 or that model is applicable to them
50:31 because data analysts don't necessarily
50:34 need machine learning right so if you're
50:36 a data scientist maybe you do need like
50:38 because otherwise you will not pass the
50:39 interview they will ask you ml but for
50:41 data analysts it's not like a must isn't
50:44 it exactly and then some other things
50:46 like anti-patterns and things that are
50:48 not recommended over engineering is the
50:50 second answer
50:52 um and this is something I've learned at
50:53 Google ship it shipping the meter rate
50:56 find the first mdp that works for you
50:59 and then iterate on it don't
51:02 don't work in a waterfall model like for
51:04 the PHD and wait for failure after five
51:06 years iterate quickly and if it's not if
51:08 that's good great if it's a model out of
51:11 the box if it's solution out of the box
51:13 and then you need later improve it with
51:14 something else great fine
51:17 I've seen this uh this kind of mentality
51:21 in a couple of Dutch companies that we
51:23 take your model out of the box like a
51:25 recommendation system and internet can
51:26 do better okay well first we have this
51:28 it makes money and then we build on top
51:32 um
51:32 let's say I think all the engineers
51:36 are guilty of that
51:43 I think there's a lot of focus on
51:46 modeling instead of the business there's
51:48 like loading routes with low Tech too if
51:51 you think enough about it yes I guess if
51:55 you want to really you want to get into
51:57 analytics because you really like these
52:00 shiny things that you might like this
52:03 machine learning you might like these
52:04 things and uh you're saying now that uh
52:08 you know what actually these things are
52:09 needed there not always right not all
52:12 the time yeah I mean um be
52:17 for example I'm like I built a model
52:19 that would estimate how much money
52:22 um you would lose in ad exchange the
52:24 tool if you do not block certain
52:26 categories of keywords and it was still
52:29 a little bit like this I mean you had a
52:31 lot of data to do the prediction on but
52:32 it was not a complex model and it was
52:34 not no it was like I think a simple
52:36 regression or some clustering with some
52:38 some super light and you know what it's
52:41 still machine learning
52:43 yeah but I don't really consider it that
52:46 level right okay
52:48 um
52:49 and in the end you know what it got
52:51 Incorporated in a product and when they
52:52 found another analyst to build them a
52:54 better model for that they could
52:55 incorporate that one
52:58 that's okay yeah best of
53:01 um other high pipey things tools that's
53:05 why like you rarely see me talk about
53:07 tools because I think it's like
53:10 you know you
53:12 you learn to ride a plane you learn to
53:14 drive a plane
53:15 it doesn't matter or you learn to drive
53:18 a car it doesn't matter which car if you
53:20 know how to drive it foreign
53:41 visualizations are not the same I think
53:44 Microsoft integration studio is still
53:45 there
53:47 [Music]
53:50 yeah most of them died I think and then
53:54 I used to work with pentahu which used
53:56 to be open source and for free is it
53:59 still around still around but it's uh it
54:02 has been rebranded as science
54:06 so I think I remember when I was I
54:09 studied bi actually as my my masters and
54:12 pentaho seems like a big thing back then
54:15 but when I graduated nobody seemed to
54:17 care about that actually
54:20 I mean that was like one or two years
54:22 when it was big and it was
54:25 yeah it was a tool of choice
54:28 okay so basically like if we talk about
54:31 all this Pentagon and other etls so then
54:33 you have a concept which is you have a
54:35 concept ETL right and all that suits
54:37 they're kind of secondary right that's
54:39 what you're saying yes like I don't see
54:41 like I don't see the point of using DVD
54:43 if I can do my orchestration myself and
54:45 just so we have a few more questions so
54:48 you probably have a lot more
54:49 anti-patterns but the the next one is
54:53 interesting so I'm making clear
54:55 transition for data science the
54:56 background is in energy sales geese
54:59 teaching assistant I was told that I
55:01 won't become an engineer do you have any
55:03 advice for young women
55:06 oh boy
55:08 tell me who told you that I can calm
55:11 myself and now no such thing
55:14 um I mean first of all I would say that
55:16 you like this person who chooses data
55:18 science from bitter blessed technical
55:20 role has a higher a longer road to of
55:24 learning to to go through than the
55:26 classic data analyst because you still
55:28 have to understand a little bit and The
55:30 Business
55:30 it it's not just a model it's also the
55:33 business model the how that money is
55:35 made what
55:37 um
55:38 so
55:40 data scientists can totally become a
55:42 data scientist I mean um you can even if
55:46 let's say that you have a role in sales
55:48 at this point
55:50 um or in finance
55:52 these are departments where forecasting
55:55 is used for time series complexities
55:57 used so you can start small with smaller
56:00 things that prove value and add to a
56:02 portfolio while still working in the
56:04 same domain and you gain knowledge in
56:06 the other
56:07 and in sales there are so many
56:10 applications actually one of the things
56:11 is lead scoring right so what is uh who
56:14 is the most promising leads
56:16 from the backlog of leads that you have
56:18 right so maybe there is a
56:21 um like it doesn't have to be very
56:22 complex right maybe it's a simple
56:24 logistic regression
56:32 dating app
56:33 and I was thinking okay just plain
56:36 forecasting like they do in Excel this
56:38 already exists
56:40 but that doesn't include things like
56:42 whether
56:44 um things like density things like
56:47 population age or
56:50 um the
56:51 what's it called the exchange of dollar
56:54 so if you have those time series and you
56:56 enrich your time series with this you
56:58 can have a better forecast and again
56:59 this can be done pretty easily by
57:03 someone in um in this role
57:06 I'm happy for that person to give her
57:08 plenty of ideas as well on how she can
57:10 leave she can book a session with me she
57:12 can email me not a problem
57:15 so what's your email or what's the best
57:17 way to contact you I guess it's LinkedIn
57:19 isn't it it's LinkedIn but you can also
57:21 like
57:22 first name dot last name at gmail so
57:25 it's
57:27 yeah because you have two first names or
57:30 like first name yeah my mom and my
57:32 grandma couldn't agree so my dad said
57:34 why don't you choose both
57:38 usually
57:39 yes so you don't use both
57:43 no okay
57:46 so even though they didn't agree which
57:48 name to give you at the end you still
57:51 use it in the morning my dad says I'm
57:52 Switzerland let the woman choose
58:01 but then there's there's another
58:02 question about the best Technologies to
58:04 practice but you said that you're not
58:06 like a tool person
58:08 practice SQL because it's getting better
58:10 for 20 years for for me and for many
58:13 people
58:14 yeah anything else that is as
58:16 fundamental as SQL
58:19 for which field
58:21 data analytics I guess
58:24 data visualization slides
58:28 soft skills for communication then since
58:30 the question is about tools then I guess
58:32 for databilization you need to pick a
58:34 tool doesn't matter which tools
58:37 and all of these tools you can also find
58:39 Tableau you can find Tableau for free or
58:41 have like a public version of it and
58:43 play with it and build your portfolio
58:45 but if you want to go into data
58:47 analytics as well as bread and butter
58:50 if
58:52 if you can add some coding on the side
58:54 that's great but if not also I don't
58:56 think it's really required I know yeah
58:59 some analysts have an area of focus like
59:01 be data visualization or troubleshooting
59:04 but depends again on the business model
59:07 if it's an online business model of
59:09 e-commerce then highly recommended to
59:11 understand how does the page work how
59:13 does the app work what is the normal
59:14 user flow
59:16 um
59:18 probably understanding a little bit
59:19 about tracking and product analytics is
59:21 very helpful and cookies are and so on
59:26 um because yeah then we understand how
59:28 things and data flows through the
59:32 app itself in order to come to your
59:34 database and if you understand that it's
59:37 it's easier to work
59:41 don't get stuck choosing the tool rights
59:44 just no don't pick any
59:47 okay I see that there are a few comments
59:50 so I want to mention them because they
59:52 are interesting before we wrap up so one
59:54 of the comments is I was one of the few
59:56 women do doing the data docs Club Zoom
59:59 camps it was hard being of the few so
1:00:03 the suggestion is join the effort with
1:00:04 women who caught and other women
1:00:06 organizations like women in data science
1:00:09 thanks a lot great suggestion so I'll
1:00:11 definitely I am in touch with some of
1:00:14 them so definitely yeah there's like the
1:00:16 woman in AI girl yeah
1:00:20 then a comment from Adonis is targeting
1:00:23 advertising advertising sounds like a
1:00:26 good idea so if anyone who is listening
1:00:29 to this conversation right now knows how
1:00:31 to do company campaigns like Facebook ah
1:00:34 you can okay good
1:00:36 so then we will be in touch but Google I
1:00:39 mean yeah okay because that's like you
1:00:42 spent six years doing that stuff right
1:00:44 well I actually last year um I
1:00:48 National role and I was supposed to be
1:00:50 head of analytics but I ended up doing
1:00:52 tag manager implementation
1:00:54 um troubleshooting of Google shopping
1:00:56 ads brand campaigns conversion tracking
1:00:59 like I can also do that I can Moonlight
1:01:02 as a marketing analyst any day
1:01:05 um
1:01:05 we have a bit of budget so we have
1:01:08 sponsors so we have a bit of budget that
1:01:10 we can spend on promoting it too
1:01:13 so yeah awesome I'll be in touch okay
1:01:16 okay thanks everyone for joining us
1:01:19 today thanks Irina for being here with
1:01:22 us today for with uh for sharing all
1:01:24 this knowledge of all these expertise
1:01:25 with us for giving all this advice and
1:01:28 uh yeah yeah thanks for asking all these
1:01:31 questions and sorry we didn't cover all
1:01:33 of them
1:01:34 I'm happy to answer on LinkedIn or on
1:01:37 email I I'm very responsive and I'm very
1:01:40 active and always open it's Irina Bruno
1:01:43 at gmail right.com yes oh just Google me
