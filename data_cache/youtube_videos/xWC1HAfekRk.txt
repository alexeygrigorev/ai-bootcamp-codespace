0:00 hi everyone welcome to our event this
0:02 event is brought to you by talks club
0:04 which is a community of people who love
0:06 data we have weekly events this is one
0:08 of such events if you want to find out
0:10 more about the ones we have there is the
0:12 link in the description check it out
0:14 you'll find many interesting events so
0:16 next week we'll actually have like three
0:18 or four three i think events um
0:22 i don't think all of them are announced
0:24 by but keep an eye on them and the
0:26 reason we have
0:27 more than one weekly event it's actually
0:29 like free is because in july we will not
0:31 have any events at all
0:33 so i'm kind of
0:35 piling them up so then we can release
0:37 them
0:37 um
0:38 separately
0:40 anyways
0:41 yeah if you haven't subscribed to our
0:43 youtube channel now it's the best time
0:44 to do this there's this red button below
0:47 the video click on this and you will get
0:49 notified about all our videos
0:51 and we have an amazing slack community
0:53 where you can
0:55 talk to other data enthusiasts
0:58 during today's interview you can ask any
1:00 question you want there is a link in the
1:02 live chat so click on this link ask your
1:05 questions and i will be covering these
1:07 questions during the interview
1:09 so this week we'll talk about data
1:11 science for social impact and we have a
1:13 special guest today christine christine
1:15 is a writer and researcher of tech and
1:18 social issues she's currently studying
1:20 data science for public policy and
1:22 previously she spent years managing
1:24 social programs and exploring data
1:27 science for social good welcome
1:28 christine
1:30 hi so happy to be here thank you
1:33 before we go into our main topic of data
1:36 science for social impact let's start
1:38 with your background can you tell us
1:39 about your career journey so far
1:42 sure absolutely so
1:44 for me i started
1:46 wanting to really
1:48 figure out how to serve marginalized
1:50 communities so i study political economy
1:52 and sustainable development in my
1:54 undergrad and then for the next four
1:56 years i worked as a program manager for
1:59 sustainability initiatives and then
2:01 after that i sort of became fascinated
2:03 with data or i saw how powerful it was
2:05 in those roles so i made sort of a pivot
2:08 into
2:09 working as a data analytics person in
2:11 the private sector for over four years
2:14 um and at that point um i needed my goal
2:18 was always to bring those things
2:19 together and that's what i'm doing now
2:20 in berlin um i came here for a graduate
2:23 program uh
2:25 it's called data science for public
2:27 policy so
2:29 yep
2:30 well what do program managers do
2:33 yes a great question so
2:35 in the social impact space you're
2:37 definitely managing uh
2:40 different initiatives
2:42 so for example i was a a program manager
2:45 at um
2:47 actually at a corporation for doing
2:50 their sustainability and corporate
2:51 social responsibility so
2:53 i was the
2:55 i want to say like king but that's not
2:58 the queen of
3:00 several initiatives that i took
3:02 ownership of and
3:04 so we had sustainability reporting
3:06 things like that that i
3:08 managed
3:10 and by managing here you make sure that
3:12 things
3:14 get done or
3:16 yeah so it's it's a little bit more than
3:18 a project management um i think the main
3:21 difference is
3:23 um is that you
3:25 not only become the face behind the
3:27 cause like these are definitely not
3:30 uh these are initiatives which don't
3:31 have an end there's there's no end um
3:35 so for example the sustainability
3:36 reporting like that organization hopes
3:39 to do that forever um
3:41 so
3:42 there's a lot of like long-term
3:44 stakeholder relationship development
3:47 and managing
3:48 large data sets and but yes ultimately
3:50 you need to
3:52 make sure to drive the situation forward
3:55 so a program with a general direction
3:57 and then projects would be individual
4:00 things steps that you need to move to
4:02 this direction
4:04 yes something with it a
4:05 known end yeah
4:07 okay and what is you said you worked as
4:11 a data unless in private sector so what
4:14 what is it what is private sector
4:17 yeah so private sector is um any
4:20 organization which
4:21 um
4:22 does not have like i think social
4:25 benefits i think that's one way to say
4:27 it so it's just corporations businesses
4:30 so for example i worked at toyota wells
4:33 fargo
4:34 uh
4:35 blue cross blue shield which is the
4:37 largest health insurer in the u.s so
4:40 yeah
4:42 so basically just
4:44 companies yep exactly yeah private yeah
4:47 so the opposite would be public sector
4:49 right which are governmental uh
4:52 institutions right exactly yes
4:55 okay
4:56 yeah so you were a program manager then
4:58 you liked data and you decided to go
5:01 more into data you became a data analyst
5:03 and then you moved to berlin to study
5:05 data science for public policy right
5:08 okay now
5:11 for those who don't speak german you
5:13 said exactly right yes exactly okay
5:16 how's your german
5:18 it's coming along i'm trying
5:20 that's
5:23 okay
5:25 so
5:27 so you are studying data science for
5:29 public policy and i was wondering what
5:31 actually public policy what is it
5:35 sure absolutely so uh public policy is
5:38 essentially um
5:41 it just it's describing all of the the
5:44 laws which you know govern
5:46 govern people and places um
5:49 and it's
5:50 important in relation to social issues
5:52 because it is the way that many social
5:55 issues are addressed
5:57 yet many social issues obviously
6:00 you know
6:02 have taken a government intervention to
6:04 address so for example like public
6:06 libraries you know like wouldn't have
6:08 happened on its own requires funding and
6:11 support um
6:13 in space things like that so
6:15 policies uh
6:16 are the way that you get things done at
6:18 that higher level
6:21 so
6:22 a
6:22 policy would be like we need
6:25 um like for every i don't know 1 000
6:28 people we need to have at least one
6:29 library
6:31 something like that yes i'm not actually
6:33 aware
6:34 of library any library laws but that
6:37 would be a good example i can give other
6:39 real examples but yes um ensuring yeah
6:41 public welfare
6:44 what are the examples you have in mind
6:46 sure yes so something that i worked on
6:49 um specifically in the states um was
6:52 environmental legislation regarding
6:54 electronics recycling
6:55 so this was something that companies did
6:57 not want to do like
6:59 companies like hp people that basically
7:01 create like printers or monitors or
7:04 things like that
7:05 essentially there was no
7:07 easy
7:08 way to recycle recycle these at the end
7:11 of their life
7:12 and so people would throw them away
7:15 nine times out of ten they would end up
7:17 on a ship
7:18 for a developing country where children
7:20 would break them down be exposed to
7:22 toxic chemicals
7:24 um
7:25 so there's just there's a lot
7:27 there's a lot that was problematic with
7:29 that situation and the companies were
7:31 not willing to create a new way for
7:33 people to easily rid this
7:36 rid themselves of these products in a
7:38 sustainable way and so um i worked as a
7:41 grassroots organizer with a non-profit
7:44 to canvas neighborhoods gather community
7:46 support to petition
7:48 lawmakers to eventually pass a law which
7:50 required them to take back
7:53 those products
7:55 and so
7:56 they put stations in every electronics
7:59 store where people could bring and they
8:01 would actually
8:02 check they were recycled in a
8:04 sustainable way
8:06 so
8:07 yeah
8:08 so the companies do not have enough
8:10 motivation to do this on their own so
8:13 they need an extra notch coming from the
8:15 government saying hey you actually must
8:18 give people a way to recycle products
8:20 exactly come up with a law and you're
8:23 kind of driving the driving force or
8:25 like you did this as a program manager
8:27 right yeah this was
8:29 uh this is actually before that this is
8:31 um i did this as a community organizer
8:34 so yes there's lots of stuff
8:36 in between and and exploring social
8:38 issues but yes i was a community
8:40 organizer so i knocked on doors actually
8:42 and like gathered
8:45 signatures and donations and then we
8:47 yeah brought everything to the capitol
8:50 you must be quite persuasive for this or
8:53 it's easy to persuade people that
8:56 this thing is bad this thing is good
8:57 give me your signature yeah you know
9:00 actually
9:01 i've i've worked for over 10 years and
9:04 seriously that is still the hardest job
9:07 i have ever done and
9:10 it's it's yeah it's not easy because you
9:12 knock on their door
9:14 they've no they don't know you they
9:15 never seen you they never heard of this
9:17 issue now you want money
9:20 and you want them to write a signature
9:23 print out some letters and so
9:25 when people are doing this where
9:26 community organizers are doing this
9:27 everywhere it's just the hardest work
9:29 i've ever done
9:31 yeah but i guess they don't have to give
9:33 you any money right so they don't give
9:35 you a signature
9:37 yeah both are both are definitely
9:39 equally as important um the letter is
9:43 what gets
9:44 this issue noticed by our
9:46 representatives but the money definitely
9:48 helps like facilitate all of that
9:50 activity like going to the capitol all
9:53 this time so
9:54 so yes that's um
9:56 so you were a volunteer but somehow
9:58 still needed to get paid right oh no i
10:01 worked i worked there yeah so it was my
10:04 job to do that but yes the organization
10:06 as a whole needed obviously funds to
10:09 operate
10:10 so we would knock on doors for eight
10:11 hours
10:14 and
10:15 this public policy so i thought like
10:18 policy like maybe it's related to
10:20 politics political science it's not
10:23 right or is it it is uh yes it's i would
10:26 say like um
10:28 like political science is just it's like
10:30 the study of the systems of governance
10:34 um
10:35 and public
10:36 policy is essentially
10:38 how like putting it into action i guess
10:41 so
10:42 um yeah i think that's a one is
10:46 yeah an application i guess more so
10:48 maybe
10:49 it's a good way to say it
10:51 and i think you partly answered that
10:54 previously so
10:55 i wanted to know like how public
10:57 policies are related to social impact
10:59 and i think
11:00 the example you gave is pretty
11:03 like i was able to understand that okay
11:06 what companies need to recycle the
11:08 products they do not want so how can we
11:10 uh
11:11 encourage them or force them to to do
11:14 this right so this is the social impact
11:16 is uh the environment is uh
11:19 well maybe it
11:21 doesn't get harm right it doesn't uh
11:24 you know you don't have these chemicals
11:26 that you mentioned like people
11:28 children do not play with
11:31 printers
11:32 right
11:34 is this how it's related right so you
11:36 come up with policies to have the social
11:39 impact
11:40 absolutely yes i think um
11:43 social issues tend to just be really
11:45 really complex
11:47 uh and
11:49 usually there's just multiple ways to
11:51 address it so i'd say for example in
11:53 that situation the bigger picture is
11:55 like how do we increase sustainability
11:57 how do we increase well-being and this
11:59 is like just one little part of that um
12:02 so
12:03 so yeah that's um
12:06 exactly exactly what you said
12:08 yeah the this data science for
12:12 public policy so i to prepare for this
12:15 interview i googled it so i found the
12:18 program where you study
12:20 and they found a couple of other
12:21 programs i think there was one in the
12:23 states in washington university i think
12:26 it was from washington dc and i saw a
12:28 couple of other places then i also came
12:31 across a book that is called like it has
12:33 exactly this name data science policy
12:36 but in general as a discipline like is
12:38 it uh mature are there like apart from
12:41 this book are there textbooks are there
12:43 people who are seriously working on this
12:46 or thinking like how can you
12:49 i don't have i want to say mary but like
12:51 how you can
12:52 do data science for public policy
12:55 sure so my my sense is that it's very
12:59 new so i started following this concept
13:02 of data science for social good maybe
13:04 five or six years ago and at that time
13:07 obviously i was in the states there was
13:08 really only one program that i was aware
13:11 of in the country it was at the
13:12 university of chicago they would have
13:13 they had a fellowship actually it wasn't
13:15 it wasn't an academic program where they
13:17 would help technical or like policy
13:20 people to like
13:22 bring these concepts together
13:24 um and actually the reason i ended up in
13:26 germany is because um
13:28 upon doing research this i'd done
13:30 research for years like looking you know
13:32 maybe i want how can i combine like what
13:34 i want to work on and this was the first
13:37 data science for public policy program i
13:39 found and now yes like you said there
13:41 are so many there are so many it feels
13:43 like they're everywhere now
13:46 but well not so many like if you just
13:48 look for programs uh university programs
13:50 in data science you'll find millions of
13:52 them sure but for so for public policy
13:56 like specifically for public policy
13:57 maybe for social good and so on there
13:59 are more but for this specific uh
14:02 uh you know think public policy there
14:04 are not so many yet
14:06 right sure yeah i guess i wasn't able to
14:09 find
14:10 yeah no you know you're exactly right
14:12 it's probably still like
14:14 less than 10 but that feels like a like
14:16 huge
14:17 amount when for years there was there
14:19 was nothing um
14:21 so and yeah and i was
14:24 like as a data scientist so i do data
14:25 science at work
14:27 and
14:28 yeah i'm usually dealing with things
14:30 like so i worked at an internet company
14:33 so we
14:34 [Music]
14:36 we
14:36 like i don't know look at clicks and
14:38 things like this and transactions
14:40 and
14:41 yeah so we as data scientists deal with
14:43 things like linear regression logistic
14:45 regression like
14:47 classification regression and so on so i
14:49 was really curious what are the cases
14:51 what are the use cases for public policy
14:54 so i checked this book that i talked
14:56 about in data science for public policy
14:58 the table of content and i saw that
15:01 there are chapters on transforming data
15:04 record linkage exploratory data analysis
15:06 analysis cluster analysis nlp
15:10 and to me it looked like okay this is
15:12 what i do like does it mean i already
15:14 know everything i need for
15:16 uh public policy or there are some
15:18 nuances
15:19 yeah there are definitely nuances so yes
15:21 i investigated this book as well i know
15:24 it's fairly new um
15:27 i i don't know that it is
15:30 i would consider it the bible or the you
15:32 know the the definer of the field at all
15:34 i do just like you said see that
15:37 majority of the book is just a data
15:38 science book so i think that that's
15:39 something that's really targeted towards
15:42 policy makers or
15:44 political scientists that want to
15:46 explore this field but i actually think
15:49 the goal of
15:51 data science for public policy is more
15:53 so data science for social impact
15:56 in the field
15:58 i guess why you
15:59 specify public policy is that
16:02 um i think there are not only a lot of
16:05 uh tech
16:06 issues ethical and challenging issues
16:09 with technology that we are facing right
16:11 now
16:12 that we need edu people actually
16:14 educated in what data science is i think
16:17 that's really critical but i think also
16:19 we're getting to a point where
16:21 every
16:22 every type of organization including
16:24 social impact organizations
16:26 will will need a data scientist to
16:28 support them or help them make progress
16:30 um and so
16:32 i think that's kind of the future as
16:34 well um and so a data scientist that has
16:37 some knowledge of the landscape or the
16:39 processes um
16:41 that's very beneficial just my
16:43 experience being in both spaces they are
16:45 completely different working for company
16:47 working in
16:48 social impact government academia
16:51 everything it's it's
16:52 it's so different um
16:55 so
16:56 okay so it's aimed at people who
16:59 uh like you were a couple of years ago
17:01 before getting into data the data world
17:04 uh it's aimed at educating them what is
17:07 data science how it can be used how it
17:09 can bring social impact right
17:12 so i actually um
17:14 our our program has quite a few
17:16 folks that are
17:18 their background is technology and there
17:20 are lots of folks that they are social
17:22 scientists and myself i'm like a mix of
17:25 both
17:26 so i do think like there's space for
17:28 everyone that wants to have a very
17:30 specific impact
17:33 i i appreciate the specificity
17:37 because social impact has so many layers
17:41 and the school i go to her tea is
17:43 actually their
17:45 school of governance so all they teach
17:47 is policy so they're just they're
17:49 experts at that part um
17:52 and i i tend to think that that method
17:54 is one of the most important methods to
17:57 accelerating change so
17:59 i do think people can come from
18:01 different ends into this space
18:04 um
18:05 and
18:06 they just need
18:07 a little bit of knowledge from both
18:09 sides so i can give a few examples of
18:12 how this has worked
18:15 so for example um
18:18 i am a organizer with data science for
18:21 social good in berlin which is a great
18:23 organization if folks want to learn more
18:24 about this
18:26 but we had a presenter come at our most
18:28 recent meetup and they are supporting
18:31 refugees that are traveling that are
18:33 making their way to the southern coast
18:35 of europe um by
18:38 flying drones and then using that that
18:41 footage
18:42 um to identify boats in the water which
18:44 they can send aid to so this is actually
18:47 really challenging issue they used
18:48 computer vision to identify the boats i
18:50 mean they shared some photos with like
18:52 can you find the boats and i'm like no
18:54 no one could no human could find these
18:56 boats
18:57 and so
18:58 you know that's it's just a really
19:00 critical
19:02 way that um this organization can
19:04 support people um
19:06 that
19:07 would otherwise receive no support so
19:10 um
19:11 yeah and i think there's so i know in
19:14 scandinavia they're using um satellite
19:16 imagery to identify all the flat roofs
19:20 so that they can assess opportunities
19:21 for rooftop gardens or or things like
19:24 that to increase sustainability and
19:26 livability in cities so i think
19:29 the
19:30 i think if you have a specific social
19:33 cause that really speaks to you or
19:35 resonates with you there is probably a
19:38 way that you can apply technology to
19:40 scale up the support for this issue so
19:44 yeah there's lots of examples but
19:46 yeah so
19:49 yeah so it can be policy related but
19:51 yeah sorry go ahead so usually there is
19:54 some social problem and then
19:55 organizations like data science for
19:57 social good and others they
19:59 have a list of problems that they think
20:02 should be addressed right and then they
20:04 get people who know data science who
20:06 know public policy who know like all
20:09 these things you mentioned
20:11 they try to put them together in one
20:13 place
20:13 and solve the problem right and this
20:16 this university that you mentioned it
20:18 kind of teaches how to
20:21 oversee this process how to run this
20:23 process right
20:25 um
20:28 they are more they're more so um
20:31 at this point teaching the subjects
20:33 separately but there is so much to learn
20:36 about the policy process um
20:39 economics policy analysis um having just
20:42 finished my first year i feel like i've
20:45 you know
20:46 there's so much more to know
20:49 um
20:50 but but yes i think um
20:54 data science for social good berlin does
20:56 have non-profit partners with data
20:59 issues that volunteers then help them
21:01 support specifically so
21:05 yeah
21:06 and
21:07 coming back to the book so in this book
21:09 one of the chapters was not the usual
21:13 you know the usual regressor or
21:15 usual
21:17 i don't know entity linking one of the
21:18 chapters was about ethics
21:21 and
21:22 how important is the problem problem of
21:25 ethical data science for public policy
21:28 sure i think it's it's absolutely
21:30 critical um i think it's you know
21:34 it's generally critical for all data
21:36 science you know i always hope you're
21:37 doing ethical data science um
21:40 but i think um the way that it relates
21:43 differently for data science for social
21:45 impact or public policy is that
21:46 ultimately we hope that laws reflect our
21:49 values they reflect um
21:52 you know the society that we want to
21:53 have so you know there are many things
21:56 that are not
21:57 illegal but they are unethical and so
22:00 there's like a gap where we as policy
22:02 makers
22:03 ideally step in and try to close close
22:06 that gap
22:07 um
22:08 so yes i'd say it's absolutely critical
22:11 and in helping these social impact
22:14 causes and organizations build a strong
22:16 foundation in data science but i also
22:18 just think that
22:20 um
22:21 we we will have some challenges i think
22:24 in the near future
22:25 regarding new technologies and
22:27 innovation that
22:28 um
22:29 yeah folks need to
22:31 understand ethics to deal with for sure
22:34 i'm guessing your printer example so
22:37 throwing away a printer will not be a
22:39 crime right but still it's not
22:42 it's not ethical right because
22:44 the like it can contaminate the
22:47 environment right
22:48 bad things can happen but nobody will
22:50 put you in jail for that
22:52 right
22:53 sure yes if you know that a
22:56 four-year-old is going to be being
22:58 exposed to toxic chemicals when you
23:00 throw it away you throw it away
23:03 yeah yeah it's not great
23:06 do you maybe have
23:08 some examples where
23:10 like some of the examples where data
23:12 science was applied but
23:14 not ethically to do these things
23:20 that's a good question
23:22 yeah let me think on that maybe i will
23:24 remember something later
23:26 because i guess people who
23:28 would work in these areas they're
23:31 maybe they're they think about these
23:34 issues of ethics
23:36 more than let's say an average
23:38 data scientist perhaps
23:40 so maybe these topics of uh abusing
23:43 something uh just to get to make the
23:45 model right just these things do not
23:48 come up oh sure
23:50 yeah actually yeah now that i think
23:52 about it there's a i can think of a few
23:54 examples
23:55 okay
23:56 sure so um one thing i think we'll
23:58 probably come to later um is uh you know
24:01 we have new legislation in the eu about
24:04 ai the euai act and so one of the things
24:07 that it deals
24:09 with its core method is essentially to
24:12 assign risk levels to different
24:14 technologies and the highest risk level
24:18 um
24:20 explicitly references this social
24:22 scoring system in china which
24:25 essentially like
24:26 through
24:27 all of your
24:29 goings and you know operations
24:31 in in society each thing will give you a
24:34 score which will give you more access in
24:37 society so for example if you get a car
24:39 loan and you pay it on time or you pay
24:41 it early
24:42 you might be able to get a visa faster
24:45 um and so i think the
24:48 the consequences of that are actually
24:52 big it's you know imagine you you
24:54 have one situation and your score is
24:56 damaged and then like
24:58 your whole family is just you know
25:00 you're second-class citizens now and you
25:03 know it's uh
25:04 so
25:05 um i think that's kind of an abuse of
25:09 big data and all of these uh
25:12 technologies and and things like that
25:14 um
25:15 yeah yeah you were given uh an example
25:18 from china but i was thinking wait a
25:20 minute isn't in germany there is a
25:22 similar thing called chufa
25:24 which is like actually
25:28 it's just like you can easily damage
25:30 this and then nobody will give you
25:32 credits
25:33 yes so
25:34 okay well maybe it's not as
25:36 you know
25:38 abroad as this system you just described
25:41 sure
25:43 i can understand so the intention is
25:44 maybe to
25:46 make people behave well right so pay
25:48 that i don't know do not
25:51 litter or whatever
25:53 but then the consequences could be
25:57 like pretty wide right right
26:00 and i think the opportunity for abuse is
26:03 obviously huge like
26:04 maybe you offend one of the maintainers
26:07 of this
26:08 database and then they just give you a
26:10 zero score and then
26:13 you can't access anything in
26:15 in the social sphere
26:17 um
26:18 so yeah
26:20 okay and what is unique
26:23 when it comes to applications of data
26:25 science to social impact projects
26:29 sure
26:30 so i think
26:32 the main difference that i see from
26:35 being in the social impact space and
26:37 also working with organizations like
26:39 data science for social good and similar
26:41 organizations in the states
26:43 is that um
26:45 it's
26:47 i think a technical person
26:49 has to sort of
26:50 expand
26:52 their thinking
26:54 because the social issue ultimately will
26:56 not be solved by this one data science
26:59 project
27:00 and so often the technical solution has
27:03 to be
27:05 it has to consider
27:07 the longevity or the bigger picture of
27:10 this social issue to
27:12 um
27:13 really
27:14 make it effective and i think also
27:16 talking to a lot of non-technical
27:19 stakeholders people that honestly like
27:21 want nothing to do with tech and will
27:23 not
27:24 understand
27:25 um what you're doing you need to really
27:30 understand not only how these
27:31 organizations work but how these
27:33 different you need to interpret all
27:34 these different things um
27:36 about the specific social issue so
27:39 um i think i s what i observe is a lot
27:41 of technologists saying like oh well
27:44 we can solve this issue with one
27:47 or here's a project idea oh but will
27:49 that solve the whole thing and it's like
27:51 nothing on earth will solve this one
27:53 problem
27:55 like yeah this is like one small part we
27:57 have
27:58 one small goal and we need to make sure
28:01 that
28:01 it lends itself to further iteration
28:05 yeah and what are the usual people
28:07 stakeholders that data scientists
28:09 working in this
28:10 domain
28:11 talk to like other policy makers
28:20 so i think nine times out of ten there
28:22 are people very close to the social
28:24 issue
28:25 um
28:26 so for example um
28:29 data science for social good i'll just
28:31 say dssg they had a hackathon
28:35 in december of last year that's
28:36 something that they do and so they had a
28:38 bunch of ngo stakeholders kind of give
28:40 data sets have a very specific problem
28:43 and so um for example the german red
28:46 cross was one of the stakeholders um
28:49 and
28:50 they were addressing a hiring issue
28:54 within their organization and so their
28:56 stakeholder was like a hiring manager
28:59 like an hr manager and so
29:01 um
29:03 that person is just they're very close
29:05 to all the challenges and
29:08 um you need to sort of mine them for
29:11 information to create a dynamic solution
29:14 so
29:15 yeah
29:17 mindful information how do you do this
29:20 like you have to
29:22 like i guess when you ask questions so
29:23 you need to ask them questions to i
29:25 don't know maybe
29:27 ask them to answer some
29:29 i don't know forms uh field some
29:31 questionnaires right
29:33 is this how you do this or you just sit
29:34 and talk
29:36 sure so i think it it takes a lot of
29:38 proactive effort on your end and then of
29:40 course yeah you you ask some questions
29:43 um so i think in this situation for
29:45 example it would have been great if the
29:47 data analysts like obviously did their
29:49 exploratory data analysis and did
29:51 research on the
29:52 the structure and history of the
29:55 the red cross
29:56 um
29:58 so that they could sort of be prepared
30:00 for what the stakeholder will share but
30:02 essentially the stakeholder like
30:05 a stakeholder generally has
30:07 very specific challenges that they face
30:10 um
30:11 and they have they don't have a sense of
30:12 how it can be solved with technology so
30:15 um they really can't help you with
30:18 you need yeah you really have to go to
30:21 them with what does their
30:23 technical system look like in their
30:25 organization
30:27 um who manages it
30:29 and things like that
30:32 and like how technically advanced this
30:34 is is it just an excel spreadsheet or
30:37 there is an actual database or there's a
30:39 i don't know website or it's like uh
30:43 old school books where you take notes
30:46 yeah you know
30:49 yeah all the above i've i feel like i've
30:51 seen everything um i guess that's one of
30:53 the big challenges that these
30:55 organizations face is
30:56 you know they're donor funded or they
30:58 have
31:00 yeah they're all
31:01 they live on donations and so a lot of
31:04 times like you need to understand that
31:06 like some staff members are
31:09 they're they're grandfunded for a
31:11 temporary amount of time and like later
31:13 that person might not be there so you
31:14 shouldn't like maybe build your
31:16 technical plan around that one
31:18 stakeholder um
31:20 so yeah i've seen it i've seen it all
31:23 but i
31:24 i unfortunately i personally have never
31:26 seen a tech technically savvy
31:30 organization so it's always like
31:32 a mess that's my experience
31:36 um
31:37 really bad if you're not an i.t company
31:41 then
31:43 you have an organization but then you
31:45 realize that he needs some sort of i.t
31:46 system
31:47 quite late
31:49 in the life of the organization right
31:52 and then we just try to put it somewhere
31:54 but it doesn't really fit
31:56 exactly
31:57 yeah that's one of the challenges i
31:59 guess that data scientists need to solve
32:01 like how okay now you have a model that
32:03 detect detects
32:05 bots in the ocean right like
32:07 you mentioned like for helping refugees
32:09 but so what like how do you
32:12 use this now how do you actually help
32:15 these people who you can detect from
32:17 this uh
32:18 drone right
32:20 right absolutely
32:22 you know i think that uh digital and
32:24 data literacy is it's really a challenge
32:26 everywhere i think every type of
32:28 organization that is not a tech company
32:31 struggles with some level of digital or
32:33 data literacy but i think the challenge
32:35 of a lot of social impact organizations
32:37 is they don't have the resources to do
32:40 this type of investment into increasing
32:43 that digital or data literacy because
32:46 due to funding they're so focused on the
32:48 cause even if that's at you know
32:51 it hinders their efficiency or
32:53 personal
32:54 progress
32:56 yeah there is a question which book are
32:58 you referring to so we were talking
32:59 about a book that is called data science
33:02 for public policy and i think there is
33:04 just one book from springer
33:06 i don't think there are multiple books
33:08 with this title i think it's just one
33:10 uh by the way i think one of the
33:13 comments you made in the document where
33:14 we discuss questions you said that there
33:16 is another book another source where it
33:18 can be where people can learn
33:21 these things so which think is it
33:24 sure sure yes so i i have a bunch of
33:26 resources i think if people want to
33:28 explore this space that will be great
33:30 but essentially the
33:32 the source that i recommend for people
33:33 that want to explore specific
33:35 applications is actually the data
33:36 science for social good fellowship
33:40 originally hosted by the university of
33:42 chicago they have an entire page of
33:44 project specific projects so yes
33:47 dssgfellowship.org
33:50 projects and i will put
33:52 the link in the comments i just shared
33:53 the link oh perfect thank you yes
33:58 so it is a list of projects so
34:00 what
34:01 we can do with these projects with this
34:03 list of projects we just can go there
34:05 check what these projects are about and
34:07 see what kind of
34:08 data was used there what kind of outcome
34:11 was achieved right exactly yes they have
34:13 they most of them have videos where the
34:17 people involved in the project talk
34:19 about challenges they face what they did
34:22 and there's all types of tech used so
34:25 computer vision
34:26 predicting text analysis there's
34:30 a great diversity
34:32 yeah one of the things i asked you a
34:34 couple of questions ago was about what's
34:36 uh unique about using data science for
34:38 social impact
34:39 um and
34:40 we talked a bit about this and i i was
34:43 wondering how difficult it is to get
34:45 data like for example in this case like
34:47 when you have drones flying over the sea
34:50 like i guess it's not that
34:51 straightforward right to get data here
34:53 and then actually label use you said
34:56 that for you as a human it was difficult
34:58 to understand which which thing is about
35:01 where is the boat
35:02 right
35:03 right yes so yes this this organization
35:07 um
35:08 i i don't want to say their name wrong
35:10 um so i'll share it in the chat but they
35:12 were
35:15 creating their own drones actually
35:17 because they had to be
35:19 sort of
35:20 uh special or fit their budget or things
35:22 like that um
35:25 so yeah they had to try multiple
35:27 different they had to iterate their data
35:30 pipeline and process to sort that out
35:32 and i think
35:34 the challenge in a lot of social impact
35:36 spaces is that you
35:38 it's a challenge not only to gather data
35:40 but
35:41 um
35:42 especially coming from the outside it's
35:44 it's really challenging to
35:46 um
35:47 find clean data there's it there's just
35:49 a lot of
35:51 gaps i guess um
35:54 yeah so it's it is a challenge to get
35:57 to get data
35:59 even if you're the one gathering it yeah
36:01 so i guess in a typical i.t company you
36:04 join a company as a data scientist
36:06 and you come and there is a
36:09 database and you just do select you join
36:11 a couple of tables then maybe
36:13 one of you of a few features are missing
36:16 maybe data is not the cleanest date on
36:19 earth but overall you can do something
36:22 right but here in this case you comment
36:24 there is nothing right there is a
36:25 problem that needs to be solved there is
36:27 no data there is no
36:29 infrastructure
36:30 for you know id infrastructure and just
36:34 a bunch of people who want to solve this
36:35 problem right exactly
36:38 imagine a data scientist building their
36:40 own drone like
36:42 yeah that's amazing you have to build
36:45 your own drone to gather data
36:47 yeah
36:49 okay um so a question from matt are
36:52 there models like guidelines websites
36:54 templates for recycling projects that
36:57 would facilitate the implementation by a
36:59 small group in the regional community
37:04 hmm
37:05 recycling in a regional community am i
37:07 hearing that right
37:10 um
37:12 man i think
37:13 that's
37:14 i think there are a few challenges there
37:16 that have nothing to do with
37:20 the data science
37:22 um
37:24 and i think there's probably a couple
37:25 ways that you can approach that um
37:29 so
37:31 i need a little bit more information i'm
37:33 sorry to give such an unsatisfying
37:35 response but matt if you do want to
37:36 reach out to me you know please do and
37:38 we're happy to chat yeah
37:40 but in general like is there any public
37:43 information on recycling projects like
37:45 the one you mentioned about printer
37:48 for people to read and get inspiration
37:50 about them is there public data about
37:52 this
37:53 um
37:56 i don't know that i'm aware of
37:59 a public data set
38:01 about
38:03 any type of recycling program i don't
38:05 know that they
38:07 keep track of how much they gather how
38:09 many people are involved um
38:13 these numbers might be buried somewhere
38:15 in a public
38:17 budget uh but they will not you only
38:19 receive like one number so like
38:22 we deployed like
38:24 5 000 cans
38:26 and you don't know what to wear
38:27 necessarily
38:29 and
38:30 i guess like the the companies the
38:32 industry who produces this electronic
38:35 equipment they're not super incentivized
38:38 uh
38:39 to
38:40 make this all this data publicly
38:42 available
38:44 right
38:45 yeah that's uh because they will have to
38:48 trust its bet for the image and then
38:51 yeah they will have to do something
38:52 about this
38:54 right yes absolutely yeah any corporate
38:56 data will not be public
39:01 okay
39:03 so a question so this podcast is great
39:06 thank you
39:07 do you have an idea this is a question
39:09 for you do you have an idea on what
39:10 project you would work when you finish
39:12 your master
39:14 oh man great question
39:17 is that my professor is that my dad
39:23 perfect yeah great question
39:25 could be either it could be my dad okay
39:29 um
39:30 yeah you know this is a great question
39:31 and i think uh
39:33 this is one of my main goals in in being
39:36 in this process and i'm currently in a
39:37 fellowship working on a few different
39:39 areas to see where i think i can be the
39:41 most effective
39:43 the issues that i think
39:46 not only do i
39:47 care about but i think are like the most
39:49 critical issues of our time are
39:52 climate justice
39:55 women's issues like gender equality just
39:58 women's issues as a whole
39:59 and then um ethical or responsible
40:03 technology
40:04 um and i think there's a lot of ways to
40:06 address all those things obviously
40:07 they're huge issues
40:09 but it would be my hope to
40:13 find some data science applications to
40:16 one of those areas for sure
40:19 and speaking of gender inequality just
40:21 yesterday we had another
40:22 conversation and one of the points there
40:25 was that
40:26 other just in general
40:29 females are not encouraged to go to stem
40:32 to fall you know to go in science
40:36 some don't like this but in general the
40:38 society doesn't encourage them to follow
40:41 this direction is there something
40:44 we can do like as uh as data scientists
40:46 let's say who work for public policy is
40:49 there any policy that can help with this
40:51 issue
40:53 sure yes i think there's a lot and i
40:54 actually saw you yesterday with olga she
40:56 was really grilling you too
40:58 i was like what's happening
41:01 my tables are turned
41:03 um it was fun
41:04 yeah good that's good
41:07 yeah i i so i i think um
41:11 actually one what i have observed in my
41:14 understanding is that a lot of times
41:15 women are not only not encouraged but
41:17 they are actually actively like
41:19 prevented from joining this field
41:22 um so
41:23 one of my
41:24 one of my jobs i have a manager who is a
41:27 woman and she wanted to go into stem but
41:29 was actually
41:31 not allowed to
41:32 um so
41:34 i think yeah on many levels this needs
41:36 to change but i do think like there are
41:38 ways that we can encourage more
41:40 transparency
41:42 because i do think a lot of this like
41:44 discrimination or subtle like
41:47 discouragement
41:48 is it's really nuanced you know it's
41:50 hard to say like make that illegal like
41:52 don't discourage like
41:54 you can't
41:56 throw someone in prison
41:57 that's what i thought and it probably
42:00 it happens on the maybe family level
42:02 right so maybe that says hey don't do
42:05 this
42:06 right so go study law or something like
42:08 this right marry a lawyer don't don't
42:11 study law marrying a lawyer
42:14 yeah absolutely i think these social
42:16 issues that's it's so ingrained i mean
42:18 we really have to all individually do
42:20 the work to study
42:22 the lessons our society has taught us
42:24 but i do think increasing transparency
42:27 in this space is one way to sort of
42:30 change the conversation right so for
42:32 example in the eu we have this like
42:34 corporate social responsibility uh
42:36 legislation which um one of the things
42:39 that's not required but is a value in
42:41 that space is
42:43 salary transparency right so
42:46 um and i think by requiring
42:48 organizations to report this information
42:52 report the makeup of their companies um
42:55 this is one way for people to see really
42:57 clearly of you know it keeps them
42:59 accountable for one but it helps them
43:01 see really clearly um
43:03 what what's happening
43:06 and
43:08 i think there could be more education
43:09 about like creating safe safer
43:12 organizations
43:14 um and i know y'all talked about like
43:16 writing job descriptions that you know
43:18 are sort of gender neutral um and
43:20 there's there's some material out there
43:21 for that but
43:23 but yeah these are some ways i think
43:24 policy could come in or community
43:26 efforts could come in and try to address
43:28 that issue
43:29 and is it something that you can
43:31 potentially work as a part of your
43:34 was it gradation project or is it part
43:35 of what you do after the masters
43:39 the rest of my life after
43:41 yeah yeah we'll have a thesis uh sure
43:43 like any other graduates uh master's
43:46 program
43:47 um
43:48 but i definitely hope to i think that
43:49 corporate social responsibility really
43:52 is
43:53 um will be critical to addressing all
43:55 those issues i think
43:57 corporations have such a huge impact now
44:00 they have such a huge reach
44:02 um we really need to require them to be
44:04 responsible
44:06 citizens of our world so
44:08 um yeah and and legislation will help
44:11 with that for sure
44:12 and i imagine then in a project like
44:14 that the modeling part will not be the
44:16 most difficult one so maybe it will be
44:19 just you know fitting a linear
44:20 regression but the most difficult part
44:22 would be like actually getting the data
44:24 analyzing the data preparing the data
44:26 right and then conveying the results in
44:29 a way that you know the problem is clear
44:31 there right
44:32 sure yes um because of this
44:35 corporate social responsibility csr
44:37 initiative in the eu
44:39 the amount of data in that space is
44:41 actually growing really rapidly so i
44:43 think
44:44 i think there will be potential for more
44:46 sophisticated
44:48 applications in the future but you're
44:49 right i think right now
44:51 it's somewhat more of a policy issue for
44:54 sure social issue yeah
44:56 and what kind of organizations need data
44:59 scientists who specialize in things like
45:02 social impact public policy is it
45:04 governments is it universities or is it
45:07 somebody else
45:08 sure
45:09 um
45:10 well i will be
45:13 the annoying person that says every
45:15 organization
45:17 in the future um and i say this because
45:19 not only does every non-profit hopefully
45:21 have a data person i think i honestly
45:24 think that data science is kind of if
45:26 the whole data space i feel like is kind
45:27 of evolving towards
45:30 more of a data person data persona
45:33 person
45:34 um
45:35 so i think obviously all those
45:37 organizations will hopefully have
45:39 support in analyzing what they have so
45:42 that they can more efficiently make
45:43 decisions
45:44 but i do but every
45:47 corporation as well has a public policy
45:51 department which
45:53 um
45:54 those people also need to understand
45:58 the technology and the way that their
46:01 business relates to technology
46:04 so
46:05 yeah i see all the time like
46:07 public policy at amazon public policy at
46:09 airbnb and you know these are these are
46:12 tech companies they need to understand
46:15 what is happening
46:17 the gaps in the ai act things like that
46:19 so i think in the future
46:21 that type of person will be very
46:23 valuable
46:25 but right now it's i know that in the
46:27 states uh
46:29 there is this position called
46:31 u.s chief data scientist
46:33 uh i think that it was uh
46:35 what's the name of that person dj patil
46:37 i think yes yes
46:39 the first but
46:41 yeah he was the first the chief data
46:42 scientist right and i'm wondering what
46:45 kind of problems they actually solve
46:47 there like all these problems we talked
46:49 about here in this podcast
46:52 sure you know i'm actually not too
46:54 familiar with his tenure um in the obama
46:59 administration
47:01 um i did follow him quite a bit
47:02 afterwards he's very
47:04 dynamic and is really a huge advocate of
47:07 the humanities education things like
47:09 that diverse education for
47:11 or backgrounds for data scientists but
47:13 um yeah i need to investigate because i
47:15 think at that point um
47:18 i think the us
47:20 does lack a lot of complete open data as
47:22 well so i think it's like data science
47:24 but maybe just like data at first i
47:26 don't know
47:29 so i guess the idea is like we already
47:31 have so many
47:32 data sets like now let's hire somebody
47:34 who can make use of this data
47:37 right
47:38 i think it was a savvy
47:39 choice for obama to like
47:42 at least send the message that we want
47:45 to be
47:46 a country that
47:47 values innovation and technology and
47:50 is proactive about
47:53 accommodating this because i think at
47:55 that time
47:56 um data science was like the buzzword
47:59 like it was very foggy as to what
48:03 data science actually was
48:05 so i think at that point it was more of
48:07 a like
48:08 i don't know
48:09 yeah yeah
48:11 i don't know
48:12 sending the message politicking i don't
48:14 know i will investigate though now this
48:16 is a great question
48:18 okay
48:19 and
48:19 now let's say somebody is interested in
48:22 learning about this and working in uh
48:26 with data science making social impact
48:29 and make the difference with data skills
48:31 with their data skills so what do they
48:34 need to get started
48:36 sure well i would just congratulate that
48:38 person and really just encourage them to
48:40 keep pursuing that but i think i would
48:42 recommend two things
48:44 so um i think
48:46 not only is data science for social good
48:49 an excellent organization but this is
48:51 kind of a global organization as well so
48:54 if you're not able to join if you don't
48:55 have a local
48:57 data science for social good
49:00 group
49:01 there are ones that you can
49:02 volunteer remotely so i think if you
49:05 feel ready to dive right in this is a
49:07 great way for you to learn from folks
49:10 that have been doing this get exposure
49:12 to social issues and things like that
49:15 but i think the second thing is i would
49:17 really encourage you to
49:20 see if you have a particular issue that
49:23 resonates with you
49:24 and really start your
49:26 research and
49:28 understanding the current landscape of
49:30 that issue so for example i think um we
49:33 have the
49:34 sustainable development goals
49:36 created by the un um and that lists out
49:40 very clear specific social issues and
49:42 goals that i think if you read through
49:44 those
49:45 find something that resonates with you
49:48 and do a little research a lot of those
49:50 because they were presented
49:52 almost a while ago there there's
49:54 beginning to be more data for each of
49:56 those specific social issues so you
49:58 could get far
49:59 on your own if you
50:01 you do have a cause in mind
50:04 is there a list somewhere because i know
50:06 that there is data science for social
50:08 good berlin i guess there is like data
50:10 science for social good germany then
50:12 there is one in portugal there is one in
50:14 poland
50:15 um
50:16 we have quite a few organizations and
50:18 then the there is uh om dana i think
50:20 they are also doing uh that do you know
50:22 home dinner i actually don't there there
50:25 are others but i have not heard of this
50:26 one
50:27 i think they are doing like a they also
50:29 get some projects and then they get data
50:32 scientists who want to get experience so
50:34 they kind of coach them and let them
50:36 work on their data skills so there are
50:38 quite a few of them it's quite um
50:42 i want to say decentralized i don't know
50:44 for the lack of a better word so what
50:46 i'm trying to ask is is there a place
50:48 where maybe all these
50:51 problems are listed and then instead of
50:53 you know your geographical
50:55 area you go to berlin data science for
50:57 social good berlin maybe instead of that
50:59 you can see a list and think okay this
51:02 problem really resonates with me i want
51:03 to work on that one
51:05 would you say like
51:07 a list of local issues or
51:10 for example like or list of issues that
51:13 might need
51:14 some sort of like a job posting or job
51:17 board with like this kind of problems
51:20 where help is needed
51:22 you know there actually is um so this
51:25 was another resource i wanted to to
51:27 share with folks watching so there's an
51:29 excellent organization
51:31 um
51:33 i think they're called 80 000 hours but
51:36 essentially their mission is to help
51:39 people
51:41 effectively create impact
51:44 so they do have a job board and they do
51:46 rank jobs based on how critical that
51:49 issue is to like
51:52 like saving the world basically like
51:54 what what's the greatest risk to
51:55 humanity
51:56 and they will rank all the issues and
51:58 organizations affiliated with that those
52:01 issues
52:02 um in that order so that's an i i will
52:06 put a link to that organization also in
52:08 the comments yeah i'm looking this up
52:10 right now so it's actually london based
52:12 on profit organization and they have
52:14 their own wikipedia page which says
52:16 they're pretty serious
52:18 yes yeah
52:20 yeah
52:21 and yeah the link is like eight do you
52:24 know why this name
52:25 eighty thousand dollars yes so i think
52:27 um
52:28 this is how long the average person
52:31 spends in their career
52:32 so if you want to you know that's quite
52:34 a long time if you think about it and
52:36 you can make a meaningful difference
52:38 with that time instead of just
52:42 okay so this is a way of encouraging
52:44 people to spend all these hours on
52:47 making the impact instead of you know
52:49 bringing revenue to yet another
52:51 uh
52:54 what i'm trying to say like corporation
52:56 so list no i'm kidding
52:59 yeah
53:00 i hit this fourth and one
53:02 sure yeah we won't we won't say that or
53:04 we won't go there but but actually
53:06 they're quite a savvy organization
53:07 they're they're quite educational so i
53:10 think there are many ways for people to
53:13 make their um
53:15 career have a huge impact so for example
53:18 um
53:19 i know they give
53:20 like this google engineer who loves this
53:23 job at google
53:24 and he did he makes a pledge to donate
53:27 like 20 of his income for the rest of
53:30 his life um
53:32 for the rest of his like 80 000 hours
53:35 and so
53:36 um and there's other things that they
53:38 they provide many different options um
53:40 they're and they they give quite a lot
53:42 of education as to
53:45 why this is impactful or what's
53:47 meaningful how to make a choice so it's
53:49 um yeah they're quite dynamic
53:53 so
53:54 i uh i'm quite interested in learning a
53:57 bit about other use cases
53:59 so maybe from your experience or maybe
54:02 now you're
54:04 learning this with other students with
54:05 your classmates what kind of problems
54:08 you see that they solve for you see in
54:10 general that are being solved right now
54:12 with data science
54:16 yeah
54:17 so i think in my program right now we're
54:19 more so
54:21 um
54:22 diving into like the deep end in both of
54:25 these topics um and have not yet had
54:28 much of an opportunity to bring them
54:30 together
54:32 um
54:33 so
54:34 i know i did a
54:36 i we had um some group projects for
54:39 example that addressed um
54:45 a lack of census data so i worked with a
54:48 group
54:51 we use satellite imagery to try to
54:52 predict poverty levels which
54:55 is an incomplete project but essentially
54:57 there are some countries that don't have
54:59 a census um afghanistan is one of them
55:02 so it would be really helpful
55:05 to have estimations of what
55:08 what poverty looks like in these
55:09 countries so that
55:11 you know
55:12 aid or support can be
55:15 accurately
55:17 you know given
55:19 and yeah of course we use computer
55:21 vision for
55:23 analyzing the satellite images
55:25 um but yes this it's like an incomplete
55:28 project but it's i guess one one way you
55:30 can sort of combine those issues
55:34 interesting
55:36 and i guess as a part of census i don't
55:38 remember last time somebody actually
55:41 asked me these questions i think it was
55:42 like 15
55:44 years ago i don't remember what kind i
55:46 they asked me by my nationality what i
55:48 do
55:49 uh
55:50 and i think that was pretty much it so i
55:52 don't know like even though i was a part
55:54 of census i don't know how much the
55:56 useful information they actually learned
55:58 about me apart from me being
56:00 me or
56:02 me having my nationality
56:05 interesting
56:06 okay
56:07 yeah
56:10 yeah anyways
56:12 um anything else that come to
56:15 your mind maybe some other problem
56:18 um
56:21 yeah nothing comes to mind right now but
56:24 i do actually want to
56:26 pitch one thing that if you want to
56:28 explore this space
56:31 so
56:32 i moderate an open coffee club that
56:34 focuses on ethics in ai
56:37 the goal is to democratize this
56:40 conversation
56:41 so
56:42 every week or every other week every
56:44 meeting every other week we have a
56:46 different
56:47 uh ethical challenge in this space so
56:50 it's just a one hour like casual coffee
56:52 chat um
56:54 start your day with
56:56 an existential crisis
56:59 a challenge for
57:01 human race
57:02 so what was the
57:04 last challenge on your
57:06 last
57:07 meeting
57:08 yeah so we actually met um yesterday
57:10 morning and we talked about lambda the
57:14 google
57:15 chat
57:15 bot which uh people are debating whether
57:18 it's sentient or not um and maybe the
57:20 potential
57:22 consequences of
57:24 the response or just the situation so
57:29 it was interesting conversation
57:31 i haven't never heard about lambda i
57:33 heard about a bot from microsoft that
57:36 went uh
57:39 it became racist pretty quickly
57:41 uh like it's starting it like because it
57:44 was trained on data from twitter so
57:46 people in twitter would you know teach
57:48 the bot and then of course uh this what
57:51 happened
57:52 if you just uh
57:55 let people do this without controlling
57:57 okay interesting i should look it up
58:00 okay well
58:02 if somebody wants to reach out to you
58:04 what's the best way to do this
58:06 sure so i'm i'm on twitter and linkedin
58:09 um i do have a website with an email
58:11 newsletter you can
58:13 try to contact or sign up um but yes i
58:16 think
58:17 these are the main ways twitter linkedin
58:19 and
58:20 christinecephalac.com so so that's
58:23 firstnamelastname.com and then you have
58:25 a newsletter there
58:26 okay we will make sure to include all
58:28 these links in the description
58:30 under the video
58:32 um
58:33 yeah i guess that's it for today thanks
58:35 a lot for joining us today thanks a lot
58:37 for sharing uh your experience the
58:39 stories with us
58:41 all these problems
58:42 yeah
58:44 no one have a crisis okay
58:46 yeah sean avent thank you so much
