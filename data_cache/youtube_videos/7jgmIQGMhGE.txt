0:38 you should do it now and then you will
0:40 get to talk about different data things
0:43 um
0:44 during today's
0:46 interview you can ask any question you
0:48 want there is a link in the live chat
0:50 click on this link
0:52 and ask any question and then i'll be

0:55 interview today
0:57 so
0:58 that's all
1:00 so now
1:02 let me just
1:03 get the questions
1:05 are you ready to start
1:07 ah yes i am
1:11 so this week we'll talk about uh doing
1:14 postdoctoral research so we have a
1:16 special guest today eleni eleni is a
1:18 postdoctoral researcher at the demon
1:20 group like tea berlin so this is the
1:22 same university where i got my master's
1:25 like six seven years ago this is the
1:27 same group where i started so eleni is
1:29 working there as a postdoctoral
1:31 researcher
1:32 she is doing research on spatial data
1:35 special big data analytics and she's
1:37 interested in stream processing in iot
1:40 environment so she
1:42 published her research in many
1:45 data management venues like vldb
1:48 and others and she published
1:51 like one of your papers one of your
1:54 papers he received the
1:56 acmc point best demonstration award
1:59 right and it was
2:01 one of the best
2:02 um yes it is
2:04 it was a demo paper so this is a special
2:06 category of paper where you actually
2:09 like demonstrate or showcase uh
2:12 you know a technique or a system that
2:13 you have developed and you know you go
2:15 to the conference and you actually have
2:17 your laptop and you know show how this
2:19 works live
2:21 so so yeah
2:22 yeah we'll talk about that as well so
2:24 eleni holds a phd in computer science
2:27 from epcl
2:28 so welcome
2:30 uh yeah uh hello thanks for having me
2:33 i'm happy to be here today
2:36 um
2:37 yeah
2:39 so before
2:40 going into our main topic of doing
2:42 research i wanted to ask you about your
2:44 background can you tell us about your
2:46 career journey so far
2:48 yes so okay you practically already
2:51 covered most of it but yeah let me also
2:53 say a few things from my
2:54 uh perspective so yes i'm currently a
2:56 postdoc at the technical university of
2:58 berlin and i have been in berlin uh
3:01 since october 2019 so roughly two years
3:04 now
3:05 prior to that i spent six years in
3:08 lausanne switzerland where i did my phd
3:10 in computer science and more
3:12 specifically in data management at epfl
3:15 which is the occult polytechnic federal
3:17 degree
3:19 during my phd i also spent some time in
3:21 new york for months
3:23 where i worked at nyu
3:26 before my phd i was in my home country
3:29 greece
3:30 where i did my undergraduate studies in
3:32 electrical and computer engineering
3:34 at the national technical university of
3:36 athens so yeah to sum it up i went from
3:38 undergrads in athens to phd in lausanne
3:40 and then i posted in berlin so i've been
3:43 in academia my whole
3:45 career so far
3:47 i had some interruption in the video but
3:49 yeah i think
3:50 so the question was about my topic right
3:53 because the uh spatial big data
3:55 analytics my main research area so far
3:58 has been spatial big data analytics this
4:01 is the
4:02 like broader topic of my phd and the
4:04 topic that i'm still working on even
4:06 though now i'm not focusing on that
4:08 entirely
4:09 um so yeah what is it um well
4:12 you know wrong speaking it is
4:14 essentially the process of analyzing
4:16 spatial data
4:17 to find trends gain insights and answer
4:20 questions and then the next question you
4:22 might have of course is what is patient
4:24 data what is this data that we are
4:25 analyzing uh and you know spatial data
4:28 is any data that contains some you know
4:31 geometric or geographic feature
4:34 so spatial data can be points in space
4:37 that can for example correspond to gps
4:39 locations so you know you have uh
4:42 you know data that is about uh
4:45 like taxi rides uh
4:47 that's special because we have the
4:49 location
4:50 and the trajectory of uh override um
4:54 then it can also be um
4:56 lines that represent uh
4:59 a road on a river on a map it can be
5:02 polygons that represent regional
5:03 boundaries uh and i think you get the
5:05 idea and these are examples that
5:08 are in two dimensions but
5:11 also we
5:12 have three-dimensional spatial data uh
5:15 so that can represent something
5:18 you know that has volume uh in space
5:20 uh and there is also another category of
5:23 spatial data uh which are um
5:27 and
5:28 the main representative of that category
5:30 is satellite images
5:32 um because in such images you have a
5:35 collection of pixels and then for each
5:38 pixel uh
5:40 that corresponds to some geographic
5:42 location
5:43 uh so this is also an example of spatial
5:45 data
5:48 so what do you usually do at work what
5:51 kind of responsibilities you have now as
5:53 a postdoctoral researcher
5:56 yeah i do a few different things i would
5:59 say okay first of all i participate in
6:03 research activities uh and that you know
6:07 again also uh contains many different
6:09 things but it broadly means you know
6:11 working to solve some research problems
6:13 or even thinking about new ones
6:15 um participating in uh you know project
6:18 meetings with other colleagues
6:21 and writing papers so when a project is
6:23 mature enough and there are results that
6:25 can be published
6:27 i also mentor students
6:30 so far mainly for bachelor and master's
6:33 thesis
6:34 but i also have some experience
6:36 co-mentoring some phd students
6:39 and currently i also teach
6:41 a bachelor course
6:44 sometimes i also have to disseminate my
6:46 research by giving talks at conferences
6:49 or other venues
6:51 and yeah finally another thing that i'm
6:54 doing it's not strictly tied to
6:58 um
6:58 you know my job description but yeah
7:00 it's that i'm also contributing
7:02 contributing to them like international
7:05 um community in my field by uh reviewing
7:08 uh papers for conferences or journals
7:11 um so yeah if i look at you know my week
7:14 i would say this is
7:16 usually what's on my schedule
7:19 is it would you say this is a typical
7:23 day of somebody working as a postdoc
7:26 in academia
7:29 um yeah i would say a typical week
7:31 because okay i you know i i try to avoid
7:34 multitasking as much as possible because
7:36 yeah i don't find it effective so i try
7:39 you know to have some days where i can
7:40 focus entirely on one activity or
7:43 another
7:44 um
7:45 so yeah i would say this is how
7:46 typically a week looks like and i mean
7:49 also but okay over the course of the
7:52 of a month or of a few months um
7:55 the like distribution of these tasks can
7:57 also change and maybe there are periods
7:59 where
8:00 uh some task goes completely away for
8:03 example okay as you know there are like
8:04 semester breaks where you don't have to
8:06 do any teaching
8:07 uh or i mean i don't always have papers
8:09 to review for conferences for example uh
8:12 but yeah
8:14 yeah but other activities like you know
8:16 having
8:16 [Music]
8:18 you know mentoring students uh having
8:21 kind of some regular meetings with them
8:22 yeah these are usually
8:29 that you're writing papers if there is
8:31 some outcome to share how often it
8:33 happens i'm curious that you do some
8:36 research
8:37 and then
8:38 yeah you don't have an outcome to share
8:40 and you don't end up writing a paper is
8:42 it
8:43 something that happens often or not
8:45 yeah that is a good question
8:48 uh i mean what can happen is that you
8:51 don't have
8:52 you know results are good enough to
8:54 write a really good paper that can be
8:56 published that they're really you know
8:59 one of the top conferences in the field
9:01 so you know yeah to have um
9:03 an idea and then results that uh are
9:07 kind of you know top level um
9:09 yeah this is hard i think it happened
9:11 that initially you're targeting this
9:13 kind of you know uh top level uh venues
9:16 that uh in the end
9:18 your results make it hard uh for you to
9:21 to publish there
9:23 but then in my experience i mean if you
9:25 still did some thorough and decent work
9:28 uh even if the results are you know a
9:31 bit disappointing and like not what you
9:33 were hoping for i mean there's still a
9:36 way to publish your work because i mean
9:38 there there is always some interesting
9:40 finding in it uh it's just that yeah you
9:43 might need to
9:44 just you know go to a less competitive
9:46 thing uh for that
9:48 but yeah i mean for me you know if there
9:51 are some reasonable results and as i
9:53 said if you can't do a good job um this
9:56 is usually the case yeah there is
10:00 it makes still sense to publish them
10:01 somewhere
10:03 and the top venues there where you
10:05 publish are usually vldb and uh what
10:08 else
10:10 yeah they're very proud of the two yeah
10:12 these two are the really the top ones
10:14 yes
10:15 so bill db's
10:18 very large what db databases yeah yes
10:23 i still remember that
10:26 yeah
10:27 and sigmoid is like special interest
10:29 group on what management of dating all
10:34 right
10:34 yeah yeah this is uh like these are the
10:37 places where researchers who work in
10:41 databases the data management big data
10:45 analytics and all these things this is
10:47 the
10:49 these are the conferences where these
10:50 researchers
10:51 want to publish first right so these are
10:53 the two yeah these are top values there
10:55 is a third one that's also
10:58 i would say
11:00 equally good is uh i it's called icd
11:03 uh so that's international conference of
11:06 data engineering
11:08 i think this this three yeah
11:11 interesting
11:12 okay and uh
11:14 um is being a postdoc different from
11:17 being a phd student so yeah you
11:19 mentioned that you need to do a lot of
11:21 things like uh thinking about research
11:23 problems writing papers mentoring
11:25 students teaching a course reading
11:27 papers
11:28 but uh phd students also
11:31 do these things right
11:33 yes you're quite right you are quite
11:35 right about that yes so
11:37 um
11:39 overall for me how i feel is that the
11:42 main difference comes because in the
11:44 faster position you have more
11:45 responsibility so it's kind of the
11:47 amount of responsibility that changes
11:50 and okay maybe also a little bit uh you
11:52 know
11:53 like the distribution of time on these
11:56 different tasks so like going back as a
11:58 phd student like still my primary
12:01 primary
12:03 job was to work on my phd thesis
12:06 it was clear that this is the top
12:08 priority
12:09 i was also teaching
12:11 as an assistant but you know that was
12:14 not more than let's say 20 percent of my
12:16 work time
12:18 and from time to times i also mentored
12:20 some bachelor and master's students
12:21 during my phd
12:23 but not so many and not so frequently
12:25 like not every semester for example um
12:28 so
12:29 and then also uh in my phd component in
12:33 my phd
12:34 research
12:35 i
12:37 was mainly conducting research on my own
12:39 so like i had a lot of a long uh time
12:43 to work on my thesis
12:47 and
12:48 yeah so what has changed now i would say
12:50 that yeah i have more mentoring
12:54 to do
12:55 so
12:56 like now i mentor students you know
12:58 every semester uh and also this
13:00 mentoring i would say comes with
13:02 more responsibility um because um you
13:05 know i mentor not only bachelor and
13:07 master students but also some phd
13:08 students like a commenter uh and um you
13:12 know it is important to ensure that they
13:14 will be successful right you don't want
13:16 your students to just
13:18 waste their time uh you know working on
13:21 something that
13:23 is not promising
13:25 and then teaching also comes now with
13:27 more responsibility uh now before as i
13:30 said i was insistent so i didn't have to
13:33 think about
13:34 you know
13:35 the tasks that needed to be done i was
13:37 assigned to these tasks i just needed to
13:39 carry them out and that was it
13:41 now i am the one that like runs the
13:43 course manages the course so i need to
13:46 organize everything and make sure that
13:48 the course runs smoothly so this
13:50 responsibility uh falls on me
13:53 and then as i said in my phd i spent
13:56 quite some you know a long working time
13:59 but yeah now i would say i do less
14:01 research completely on my own and more
14:04 in collaboration with others
14:07 and in my like everyday life this also
14:10 means that i spend more time in meetings
14:13 with other people
14:15 and yeah i also mentioned uh
14:17 the like reviewing papers before and i i
14:21 have to say that this is something that
14:23 i didn't do much in my phd
14:26 uh but you know that's normal because
14:29 you are invited to uh review papers for
14:31 conferences when you are a little bit
14:32 more senior uh in the field so
14:36 yeah usually you don't get a lot of
14:38 these invitations as a phd student
14:40 so if i summarize then you get a broader
14:43 scope so you
14:45 do not
14:46 get to do as many i guess so previously
14:50 you would just sit and do research
14:51 yourself but now you're more like
14:53 delegating the work to others so others
14:56 do research and uh you're helping them
14:58 uh with that
15:00 instead of just sitting there just by
15:02 yourself uh doing that right did they
15:04 summarize it uh yes i would say
15:07 currently i actually kind of work a bit
15:09 in two modes i mean yeah there is a
15:11 little bit of delegating aspect which um
15:13 you can say happens when
15:15 i work with uh with a student because i
15:17 mean
15:18 you know still like if someone is doing
15:20 like their thesis with me or their phd
15:23 i mean they are still uh expected to own
15:26 their work and you know
15:29 these their own thesis i mean i help
15:30 them but i'm not supposed to
15:32 improve the thesis for them right so in
15:34 that sense uh yeah
15:36 uh um i'm providing guidance uh but then
15:39 i'm also i also do some
15:42 i mean
15:43 i get not on a constant basis but like
15:45 say in the past year i also do some
15:47 collaborative research with other
15:49 researchers that are more um like uh at
15:52 the same level of seniority as me let's
15:54 say so in that sense it's more a
15:56 collaboration and nobody's delegating
15:57 anything to someone else we would like
15:59 to to to the other person but it's more
16:02 kind of you know
16:05 sharing
16:06 the
16:09 yeah thanks and then you mentioned one
16:11 thing i think that's quite important so
16:14 now a part of your job so you have more
16:16 responsibility and the part of your job
16:18 is
16:18 you need to help others be more
16:20 successful so you have bachelor students
16:23 you have master students you have phd
16:25 students that you call
16:27 a commenter or
16:29 advice
16:30 now
16:30 so how do you actually make sure that
16:32 they are more successful like oh
16:35 how do you do this
16:37 like how do you help them select topics
16:39 like because phd this is quite
16:42 a large
16:44 piece of work right it's like
16:46 five years
16:47 um
16:48 so that's a lot of responsibility
16:51 when you come up with a topic so how do
16:53 you help them
16:55 [Music]
16:57 uh yeah that's a
16:59 great question
17:01 um so okay maybe i can also talk a bit
17:04 about uh
17:05 yeah
17:06 master and bachelor students so in this
17:08 case i have to say it's easier of course
17:10 and yeah most of my experience also is
17:13 with working with master and bachelor
17:15 students uh because in that case um i'm
17:18 typically the one that proposes a list
17:20 of topics like i advertise these topics
17:22 and then
17:23 the student picks you and they like and
17:25 then we potentially tailor it together
17:27 to their interests so you know there
17:30 it's a little bit easier the scope is
17:32 also uh smaller because uh
17:35 you know this is research that needs to
17:36 be completed within let's say six months
17:39 right so
17:40 yeah
17:42 that also limits a little bit uh you
17:44 know what you can do um during that time
17:46 uh now in terms of phd students so far i
17:49 have only acted as a co-supervisor which
17:51 means that also the responsibility is
17:53 shared
17:55 but overall how it works at dima um
17:59 at least what i have seen so far and my
18:01 time at lima is that in general we have
18:04 a few bigger um research themes
18:07 uh in the group um like some bigger
18:10 umbrella topics um that
18:12 you know they are mostly i guess
18:15 determined by uh
18:19 the leader of the group professor markle
18:22 uh and then students typically so i mean
18:25 students typically need to identify a
18:27 sub-topic that interests them within
18:28 these bigger research teams so already
18:31 you know the fact that there's kind of
18:32 these bigger umbrella topics provides
18:34 some guidance
18:36 uh and then from there you know they
18:38 come up with ideas
18:41 you know by reading brainstorming
18:42 talking to their mentors
18:44 but also to other uh colleagues and
18:46 fellow students and that's why you know
18:49 the whole group can kind of provide some
18:51 guidance there
18:52 uh so yeah for phd students i don't
18:55 dictate the topic
18:57 they
18:58 mostly have to come up with it on their
19:00 own within
19:02 like a bigger research team but i mostly
19:05 how i help them is mostly by
19:08 you know asking them questions and
19:10 talking to them to make sure that they
19:11 really understand the problem that they
19:12 picked and to also make sure that uh
19:14 this is indeed an open research problem
19:17 uh so you know i
19:19 expect the student for example to be
19:20 able to clearly articulate what the
19:22 problem is you know like succinctly and
19:25 like in a sentence ideally
19:28 why it is interesting uh and important
19:31 and why it is hard and why it hasn't
19:32 been solved before so you know
19:35 usually i
19:37 challenge the student and the student
19:38 has to convince me that they can answer
19:40 these questions about their chosen topic
19:44 and then you know
19:45 then we can go ahead with that topic
19:48 is it some sort of formal process where
19:50 the student just comes to you and you
19:52 have a discussion over i don't know a
19:53 cup of tea
19:55 and you ask tough questions
19:57 uh
19:58 well i mean it is a little bit of a more
20:00 formal process in the sense that they're
20:02 like no we have some like regular
20:04 meetings with some structure and yeah
20:07 also in some cases it might be that i
20:09 ask the student to actually you know
20:11 answer these questions in written form
20:13 because sometimes also writing down
20:16 things uh helps you
20:18 you know structure your thoughts
20:20 um and then yeah i mean as i said i'm
20:22 the commenter right so there's
20:25 there are also other people that uh
20:27 um
20:30 interact with the students and make sure
20:32 that
20:33 they are working on something good
20:36 but from what i understood it's actually
20:38 the responsibility of a phd student to
20:40 come up with a good topic you're just
20:42 helping them to to make sure that the
20:45 topic they pick up is good and they
20:47 really understand what they want to
20:48 solve right but
20:50 it's more like coaching
20:52 yeah this is how it usually yeah works
20:55 so
20:56 uh yeah
20:58 i mean yeah overall in academia i have
21:00 seen
21:03 and i mean this is also more or less how
21:04 it was for me right in my phd like i was
21:06 not assigned to specific topics that i
21:09 worked on on the specific problems i was
21:11 given a broader direction but then you
21:13 know finding the specific research
21:15 problem within that
21:17 direction was my own responsibility i
21:20 mean i have seen in other
21:21 [Music]
21:23 groups in academia and that especially
21:25 for
21:26 first-year students it might be that
21:27 actually the professor gives them some
21:29 more concrete topics like similar to how
21:31 i said i give topics to master students
21:35 so
21:36 like usually to get them started with
21:38 their like first with the first research
21:40 problem that they will um work on
21:43 but yeah i mean as you said earlier also
21:45 a phd is a larger piece of work so
21:48 usually you know you're you're expected
21:50 to publish two or three papers
21:52 that will all be part of your phd so
21:55 even if you are assigned a topic at the
21:57 beginning you're still expecting that
21:58 you know for the next paper uh you will
22:00 be more independent in choosing your own
22:02 topic
22:04 i'm curious how does it work like you
22:06 have a broader direction and then a
22:08 student come with a more neurons
22:10 research do they just read a lot of
22:12 papers and then
22:14 see which ideas they like and then they
22:16 just run these ideas by you and you say
22:18 yeah these are cool ideas let's dig
22:20 deeper something like that
22:22 yeah something like that i mean okay
22:24 yeah
22:25 it could also be that we provide a few
22:27 more pointers about you know what is
22:29 still open uh
22:31 in this broader topic because
22:33 since the the topics are broader it also
22:35 means that there is there are other
22:36 people also that work in
22:38 the broader area so
22:40 we also want to make sure that each
22:42 student has a separate topic from the
22:44 other students and they don't overlap
22:45 too much right so
22:47 yeah we also have some pointers about
22:49 okay this uh these are not taken yet or
22:51 like in this direction
22:52 yeah and by the way what are the
22:56 so you said there are a few bigger
22:58 research themes in the group
23:00 uh what are these themes
23:02 it's a demon group so i know iot right
23:05 is one of these
23:06 topics what are the others
23:08 now there are practically two bigger
23:10 topics now so one is yes iot or like um
23:13 you know
23:15 building a general purpose
23:17 data management system for the iot
23:21 this is a
23:23 system that we call a nebula strip
23:26 and then there is another topic
23:29 that
23:30 we call agora
23:32 and this is a unified data
23:34 infrastructure for building ecosystems
23:38 and in this ecosystem we want to bring
23:40 together
23:41 different data assets that can be data
23:44 itself but also algorithms models
23:46 computational resources
23:48 so that uh users can combine all these
23:51 resources uh and uh yeah
23:54 they can um use them uh to develop on
23:58 their applications
24:00 is the demogroup still involved with
24:02 apache flink because i remember when i
24:04 was started there it was like a very big
24:06 thing and
24:07 a lot of research was focused on
24:09 flink but now since link like is a more
24:12 independent entity is it still
24:14 the case um yeah not really so basically
24:18 in a sense this nebulous stream system
24:20 is kind of the next flink you would say
24:23 uh yeah
24:25 um but yeah i mean you see this is
24:27 representative of how yeah
24:29 the demon group works you know yeah
24:30 before there was flink and a lot of
24:34 researchers were working on different
24:36 problems related to that system and now
24:38 we have nebulous stream and agora and
24:40 you know a lot of
24:41 the research goes into building these
24:44 systems
24:45 cool so you're working on the next link
24:47 that's that's really awesome
24:49 so the working name now is nebula right
24:53 yeah
24:54 yeah interesting and
24:57 in general i'm curious
24:59 how do you know what are the important
25:01 topics in research so if there are some
25:03 topics like themes in in the group in
25:06 general
25:07 that you try to
25:09 you know to stay within these teams
25:12 but this is still quite broad right so
25:14 this uh streaming in general
25:17 is quite broad like how do you know what
25:19 is uh an important topic like what uh
25:22 what are the trends in this in this
25:24 topic
25:25 like how do you stay on top of that
25:28 well that's hard i mean it's a very good
25:30 question like something in general hard
25:32 to do i guess
25:33 i mean it depends also a little bit on
25:35 how much uh forward we want to look into
25:37 the future i think in general you can
25:40 tell what are like the current important
25:42 topics and trends mainly by looking at
25:44 what is being published currently at the
25:47 major conferences right in your field
25:49 and it can help even more if you attend
25:51 these conferences um
25:53 to exchange ideas with your peers
25:55 so
25:56 yeah this helps you identify yeah the
26:00 trendy topics
26:01 in the present time
26:04 um
26:05 now as i said i have also been reviewing
26:07 papers for conferences and in general
26:10 this means that they have access to
26:11 papers before they are actually
26:13 published while they're still working
26:16 progress
26:17 and
26:18 this to some extent can help foresee
26:20 trends
26:21 that might come up in the near future so
26:23 let's say within one two three years
26:25 maybe because yeah you still get access
26:28 to some work that's
26:29 yeah not published and maybe it won't be
26:31 published
26:32 uh that cycle but um you see what people
26:36 are working on so this helps you form an
26:38 idea but what is really hard of course
26:41 is um
26:42 to predict the next big trend that will
26:44 come let's say 10 years or so
26:47 and i mean unfortunately i cannot claim
26:49 that i'm in a position to do that
26:51 but if you can really do this um it is
26:54 very valuable because yeah i mean these
26:56 strengths in research are coming a
26:57 little bit in waves uh and if you are at
27:00 the beginning of such a wave and you are
27:02 one of the first people um to work on a
27:04 certain topic before it is broadly
27:06 popular
27:07 uh when later the topic becomes popular
27:10 so if your you know prediction was
27:12 correct and this becomes an important
27:13 topic you will be a pioneer in the field
27:15 right and your work will really get a
27:17 lot of attention
27:18 and a lot of people will refer back to
27:20 it and
27:21 cite it which is something that matters
27:25 now
27:27 in
27:28 something else that i can mention here
27:30 is that in the database research
27:31 community there is a tradition that
27:33 every few years i think every five years
27:36 or so
27:37 a group of more senior database
27:40 researchers
27:41 gather together uh and
27:44 like in the same location so they meet
27:46 physically and they brainstorm uh on
27:48 what are the big
27:50 trends the next big trends and how we as
27:53 a community can get more impact out of
27:55 our research
27:57 and uh yeah after the gathering they
28:00 write down their findings in the report
28:02 so
28:03 yeah in general i find that this can be
28:06 quite helpful for more um junior
28:08 researchers um to help them identify
28:11 future research directions
28:13 and yeah i mentioned before that um yeah
28:15 going to conferences can also help and
28:17 one of the reasons uh one other reason
28:19 that it can help is that there are also
28:21 some like discussion panels where again
28:23 you see more senior people
28:26 uh you know discuss about the future of
28:28 the fields so yeah so basically
28:31 networking right
28:33 so conferences seeing what is published
28:37 do you think it's important to also
28:40 be in touch with maybe industry partners
28:43 to see what is
28:44 going on in industry
28:46 to see
28:47 you know
28:48 like what may be
28:50 will be important there or
28:54 the conferences scientific necessary now
28:57 that is a great uh point and i mean i
28:59 have to say that in general in our
29:00 conferences i mean there are also people
29:02 from industry i mean we are not
29:04 you know we yeah yeah we are a field
29:06 that is quite open to to to industry
29:10 um so so yeah definitely i think this is
29:14 also something that uh
29:16 i can help um
29:19 yeah
29:21 and uh finally i think that you
29:22 mentioned that you know
29:24 speaking things that will be important
29:26 in the future is uh difficult well the
29:28 demon group i think managed to do it at
29:30 least once with flink yeah and i
29:33 remember when i was choosing whether to
29:35 go to berlin or to some other city so i
29:38 saw a pitch from professor michael and
29:40 what he said was that
29:42 they don't at dima they do not teach
29:45 things that are important now
29:47 they teach things that will be important
29:48 in like three five years
29:51 and
29:52 yeah he would then go into
29:55 flink back then it was called satisfy i
29:57 think like how cool this thing is and he
30:00 was actually right like
30:03 because back then i don't think it was
30:05 really appreciated
30:07 in the industry like this spring thing
30:10 but now yeah people like it
30:13 yeah definitely i mean yeah i would say
30:15 in the sense yeah definitely professor
30:17 martel is a visionary person and yeah i
30:21 mean in that sense again for me as a
30:23 more junior researcher it also helps to
30:25 have him as a mentor
30:27 okay so but the domain
30:30 sort of the main way of seeing trends in
30:32 research is attending conferences and
30:35 then doing these gatherings and then
30:37 having discussion panels and i think you
30:39 mentioned those reviewing papers
30:41 which is
30:42 um how typical it is for people to also
30:45 work on reviewing papers like do all
30:48 postdocs do this or
30:50 not everyone
30:53 i would say most postdocs i mean you
30:56 know to get to review papers i mean you
30:58 have to be invited
31:00 and you know it's invitation based
31:03 and then it but then you know it is also
31:06 a volunteering activity so in general
31:08 you know yeah you're not getting paid or
31:10 anything to do that right so
31:12 uh but yeah i i you know i would say
31:14 most postdocs um you know are
31:19 known enough
31:20 to to be invited for suction
31:23 for such things yeah
31:26 um
31:30 yeah someone has invited you so they
31:31 they need to do something you know
31:34 a few papers and then they say okay this
31:36 person is clearly uh this person clearly
31:39 knows what the
31:40 like about this particular area or
31:42 research that's invite them and ask them
31:44 to review papers
31:47 yeah i mean i would say yeah you need to
31:49 have published some papers on your own
31:50 because it's also a little bit weird to
31:52 judge
31:53 other people's research if yourself have
31:55 not proved that you are actually able to
31:58 conduct good research
32:00 but then you know
32:02 it might be the case that someone has
32:04 published a lot of papers but they're
32:05 still not invited for these conferences
32:07 just because they don't know
32:10 a key person in the committee that can
32:12 actually uh invite them to to you know
32:15 to be in the committee so in that sense
32:18 you have totally some networking
32:21 in my case i guess i was uh you know
32:23 lucky that i have been in
32:26 research groups that have visibility and
32:29 so both like the demon group and also my
32:33 group at epfl which was called diaz
32:36 um yeah our
32:38 research groups that have international
32:40 visibility are all the best in the field
32:44 so you know that also helped
32:47 for me to get visibility
32:49 yeah thanks and speaking of trends in
32:53 research so sometimes you come to a
32:55 conference and then there is one topic
32:57 that everyone talks about like it's
32:59 clearly
33:00 but the next year you come and everyone
33:02 forgets about this i'm sure you can
33:04 think of such things that you know
33:06 common ways and then go and a few years
33:09 after that nobody remembers god right so
33:12 i would call it like hype
33:15 but there are things that uh
33:17 you know they don't get
33:19 the attention they deserve
33:22 sometimes there are other things people
33:24 get more excited about them but there
33:26 are things that maybe people
33:28 do not notice
33:30 do you think there are some research
33:31 topics in uh in your area of research
33:34 that are underrated right now
33:38 yeah i have to say that's a
33:40 difficult question i think uh so first
33:42 i'll try to give a bit of a more general
33:44 answer
33:45 so one of the things that i have
33:46 personally noticed in the field um that
33:49 to some extent bothers me is that in
33:51 most cases
33:52 people only focus on improving
33:54 performance which typically means
33:57 you know improving runtimes or measuring
33:59 performance by runtime
34:01 so when you come up with a new technique
34:03 and a new solution in order to convince
34:05 the reviewers at the conferences to
34:06 accept your paper for publication
34:09 you usually have to show all my new
34:10 technique is like x times faster than
34:12 all previous techniques and then you
34:14 know it's easy but of course
34:17 yeah this is important to improve you
34:19 know decrease the runtime but there are
34:22 also a lot of metrics that can be
34:23 important
34:24 um like i i don't know like the ease of
34:27 adoption of a certain technique or you
34:29 know the usability the programmability
34:31 or even things like energy consumption
34:34 and these metrics in my experience are
34:36 typically a bit overlooked so
34:38 to some extent i think this happens
34:40 because they are a little bit hard to
34:41 quantify and put in a number
34:44 uh and that's the result so that's a bit
34:45 of a general answer but as a result i
34:47 think if your work focuses on improving
34:49 a metric that's other than performance
34:52 uh it is usually
34:54 in my opinion a bit undervalued by the
34:57 community and you know it's harder for
34:59 you to publish your work and then there
35:02 is another like broader topic that i
35:05 think um well i do not think it is
35:07 undervalued but maybe you could say that
35:09 it's uh
35:11 underrated because it's a topic that uh
35:14 everyone understands its importance
35:16 uh but it's still not so popular in the
35:18 sense that not so many people want to
35:19 work on that and the topic is a data
35:22 cleaning
35:23 um so
35:25 i mean i i think everybody would agree
35:26 this is a really important uh to like
35:28 really open a problem
35:30 um
35:31 but yeah i don't i don't think there are
35:33 enough people working on that right now
35:36 and yeah i mean i think this is probably
35:39 a combination of factors because it is a
35:40 really hard problem so to begin with
35:42 this is a bit scary i think and at the
35:45 same time again maybe there is this
35:46 issue that
35:48 in the case of data cleaning
35:50 uh it is harder to quantify again the
35:52 impact of new approaches and convince
35:54 the community about their value i mean
35:55 again you cannot say and uh you cannot
35:58 just go and say oh i made things like
36:00 you know towards why we look faster it's
36:02 a bit more complex than that
36:04 i'm wondering okay data cleaning is more
36:06 like art than science like how do you
36:08 actually quantify that
36:10 i guess there are metrics that you know
36:12 measure the cleanness of data like
36:14 yeah i guess this is a sticky one
36:17 and uh
36:18 is there research in this area
36:20 yeah i mean there there is still
36:22 research yes of course i mean i i don't
36:24 have experience i haven't done research
36:25 in this area i mean i have to say that i
36:28 went like early in my phd
36:30 um
36:32 you know my professor mentioned this as
36:34 an option back then and i have to say
36:35 that i was also a little bit negative or
36:37 scared of the topic uh
36:40 because okay i mean to some extent it
36:42 still might be that yourself you
36:44 recognize that the problem is important
36:45 but okay you also need to like it for
36:47 some reason you don't like it okay you
36:49 cannot force yourself to work on that
36:51 even if you believe that it's important
36:53 um
36:54 but yeah i mean there are people uh yeah
36:58 it's not i mean it is an existing
37:00 research area definitely
37:02 um
37:03 i just think that the overall it's still
37:06 not popular enough i mean it's not as
37:08 sexy or fancy as other topics
37:11 that are probably less important
37:14 right now at least in the industry this
37:15 is a very very manual process you need
37:18 to do about trials and errors and then
37:20 you need to handle the corner cases and
37:23 then the code you have for cleaning like
37:25 becomes bigger and bigger with every
37:27 corner case i guess the area of research
37:29 would be like how to actually automate
37:31 it this side
37:32 yeah yeah
37:34 infinite loop of uh trial and error how
37:37 do you actually have a
37:39 way to automatically figuring out what
37:41 the data problems basically problems are
37:43 and solving them yeah yeah i mean yeah
37:48 yeah the main effort yeah i would go to
37:50 like
37:50 uh either fully automate or i mean maybe
37:53 that's not still so realistic but at
37:54 least uh yeah make it easier for the you
37:56 know data scientists
37:58 yeah i can relate to that problem like i
38:01 can imagine like having a black box
38:03 saying hey like here's a pile of dirty
38:05 data please make it nice
38:07 yeah i wouldn't use that
38:10 can you imagine yes
38:13 yeah thanks and you also mentioned now
38:15 that as a postdoc you do a lot of
38:20 work in collaboration with other
38:22 postdocs so they are on the same level
38:24 so you are not necessarily mentoring
38:25 them
38:26 but you are more collaborating with them
38:29 do you collaborate do you work a lot of
38:31 people from different industries
38:34 like maybe let's say from different
38:35 groups that are not necessarily
38:38 data management groups
38:41 um yeah that's um yeah i have some
38:44 experience yes working with people that
38:46 are not in data management
38:48 uh so
38:50 um yeah um
38:52 because i mean yeah in general uh
38:55 there are connections so uh it's easy to
38:57 find connections uh from data management
39:00 to other disciplines
39:03 so
39:05 um for example yeah in my phd uh i was
39:08 involved in a large
39:10 multi-disciplinary
39:12 project and that was uh and tlis
39:15 called the human brain project
39:18 and one of the main goals of the project
39:20 was to build um
39:22 three-dimensional models of the human
39:24 brain and then run simulations over them
39:26 so for that project i had a
39:29 collaboration
39:30 with neuroscientists
39:32 that were the ones
39:34 building their brain models and then
39:37 within that collaboration i developed
39:39 some like tools
39:41 that allow them to access subregions of
39:43 those models more efficiently so this is
39:47 the data management component
39:49 so
39:51 yeah in my experience having this kind
39:53 of collaborations
39:55 does require some extra effort
39:57 because you need to find a common
39:59 language
40:00 no you need to find a way to communicate
40:02 with someone who is outside of your
40:04 field
40:05 and that's not always easy
40:08 and it goes both ways i mean you know
40:10 some things that were obvious to me i
40:12 had to understand that it's not to
40:14 someone outside of the field and i have
40:15 to find a way to explain to them
40:18 but also you know to understand what
40:20 they are telling me
40:21 um but yeah i am it can also be quite
40:24 rewarding because um you see your work
40:27 being applied to solve the real problem
40:30 um
40:30 [Music]
40:32 yeah
40:33 yeah i remember in dima so like it was a
40:37 seventh floor building uh so we were on
40:39 the seventh floor and then sometimes i
40:41 would go on the sixth floor and then
40:43 there was a group that was doing some
40:45 video and coding i don't remember like a
40:47 completely different thing
40:50 and then i don't remember what was on
40:52 the fifth floor but also something
40:53 unrelated and what i found interesting
40:56 is that um these groups they don't
40:58 really communicate with each other
41:00 so do you
41:02 um is is it still the case or you're
41:05 trying to somehow find ways of
41:08 connecting with each other
41:09 yeah that's a good point i mean
41:11 um
41:13 maybe now it has improved i would say um
41:16 like actually there is one um issue that
41:19 they find a problem
41:20 as you said that um
41:24 where the group is which is the actual
41:26 building no i mean i i think it's
41:28 actually not so great that yeah the
41:30 demon group is on the seventh floor uh
41:32 you know by itself so everybody on that
41:34 floor is from the same group so
41:36 and then the other groups are on
41:37 different floors and then you know you
41:39 have a common lounge area but when you
41:41 are there you will only see and interact
41:44 with people from your own group there's
41:45 no chance you'll meet someone outside
41:47 outside of your group where you can
41:48 initiate some maybe interesting
41:49 discussion
41:50 so um yeah i i think that this is not
41:54 great and um yeah if we had like some
41:57 like lounge areas
41:59 where people from different groups can
42:00 hang out uh this would really help a lot
42:03 to like you know bootstrap some
42:05 collaborations and i have to say in my
42:07 previous group it was a little bit um
42:09 there was a bit more mean link between
42:11 yeah and my previous university there
42:13 was a bit more middling between the
42:14 different groups um however yeah you
42:17 mentioned the sixth floor so i'm not i'm
42:18 not sure yeah which group you were
42:20 you're referring to but for example
42:22 right now
42:23 uh i am involved also in a collaboration
42:25 with another group um actually berlin
42:27 which is the remote sensing group
42:30 and yeah
42:31 in this
42:33 group they
42:35 are working with like satellite imagery
42:38 um
42:40 and
42:41 yeah how to efficiently
42:45 index these images but based on their
42:48 actual content
42:50 which requires some deep learning
42:51 techniques that they have developed
42:54 and yes and i mean we have a
42:56 collaboration with them to you know help
42:58 them tackle the problem also from the
43:00 data management
43:02 aspect
43:03 um
43:04 yeah
43:05 yeah sorry if it came as uh came out as
43:08 a critique i wanted to lead actually
43:10 this to you know asking how you
43:12 collaborate with other groups and how
43:14 you find uh you know ways of
43:16 collaborating and this what you brought
43:18 up like remote sensing group yeah it's
43:20 quite interesting um do you know how it
43:23 happened like how you met and decided to
43:25 work
43:26 together because i guess this is also
43:28 related to your
43:30 uh
43:31 area of research like this special
43:33 analysis exactly yes yes um it does um
43:37 not but yeah however yeah i mean even
43:40 though i have been
43:41 i mean i am involved in this um
43:43 collaboration i have also been in
43:45 collaborations before i was not the one
43:46 that like would drop them like that
43:48 initiated them i mean this was done
43:51 usually by you know the professors
43:52 leading the groups um so
43:56 i would say this was probably the case
43:59 uh here i mean i was brought in touch
44:01 with a professor that works in remote
44:03 sensing through you know
44:05 my uh
44:08 through the professor that i'm working
44:10 with so
44:12 yeah
44:13 he made the connection um
44:17 yeah thanks i noticed that
44:19 i've been ignoring questions so
44:21 apologies for that so we have a few
44:23 questions and uh amin is asking uh he's
44:26 or she
44:27 i don't know
44:28 so i mean
44:30 he's wondering um for computer master
44:32 student what field
44:35 would be good
44:36 to work in order to be able to apply for
44:39 a phd position at a top european or
44:42 american university
44:45 um
44:47 i mean okay i
44:49 that's a good question but i mean of
44:50 course it's really i would say you know
44:52 it depends on your interests right and i
44:54 mean i'm in data management so i would
44:56 you know advertise and support my field
44:58 uh
44:59 i would say you know
45:01 to do research in data management um
45:04 so but you know in the end of the day
45:06 you should pick the topic some that um
45:10 you like and in the end uh what matters
45:13 is
45:14 you know the quality of your research
45:16 rather than the um
45:20 the topic now that said of course i mean
45:23 i cannot ignore that uh right now there
45:25 is a big um
45:28 um
45:30 let's say uh
45:33 focus
45:34 in academia on
45:36 ai and machine learning right
45:38 i mean i cannot ignore that
45:41 so in that sense
45:43 in these domains
45:45 there are probably more opportunities
45:47 and open positions
45:49 than in other domains
45:51 but also there is more competition so
45:53 this is also something to take into
45:55 account
45:56 and that's why again it goes back to
45:58 really make sure that this is something
46:00 that you like and you want to do it
46:02 because you like it and not because it's
46:04 um you know then next
46:05 you know because it's popular right now
46:08 uh because there is competition so if
46:10 you don't like it enough there will be
46:12 someone else that does it and they like
46:14 it and they will be better than you
46:17 yeah and
46:18 i guess like for any field you take you
46:21 will be able to find a university or a
46:24 group at some university
46:26 that does this work and you'll be able
46:28 to go there
46:31 but i'm curious like how do you go about
46:33 selecting topics there so let's say you
46:36 pick a broader field
46:37 and then you want to find some topics
46:39 that uh
46:41 and i think it goes back to the
46:43 discussion we have like identifying
46:45 trends so i guess this is what uh you
46:47 can also do right so you can
46:49 look at take a look at the conference
46:51 conferences like bigger venues in this
46:54 field and then see what are the
46:57 trends there right and then you can pick
46:59 some of these trends there and try to
47:02 um to see if
47:04 you like them right
47:06 yeah
47:07 and yeah then yeah maybe two more things
47:10 uh so okay of uh one thing maybe is to
47:13 try to do research already in your
47:15 masters
47:17 because uh yeah this can help you
47:20 identify what
47:22 you like
47:23 which can mean that you know you may
47:25 work in your masters in the field and
47:27 you see that you really like it and you
47:28 continue in your phd but it can also
47:30 mean that you try something in your
47:31 masters and it's a good way to find out
47:33 that you actually don't like it and then
47:35 you fall into a different area which was
47:37 a little bit the case uh for me for
47:40 example like my master's thesis topic
47:42 was related to signal processing so it
47:44 was not in databases
47:46 um
47:48 and another thing that i actually also
47:51 did is that i did an internship
47:54 prior to my phd in the same group where
47:57 i ended up doing my phd
47:58 uh but i first worked there a few months
48:00 as an intern again to kind of make sure
48:02 that this is something i like before i
48:05 commit to something bigger like a phd
48:08 uh and in addition to that in my
48:10 previous university uh etf in
48:13 switzerland and there might be other
48:14 universities that apply the same thing
48:17 i'm not sure about that but there was a
48:19 chance that um
48:21 if you're selected with a fellowship
48:24 you can actually spend your first year
48:25 at the university working on different
48:28 groups
48:29 um
48:30 until you decide which is a group where
48:33 you actually want to stay and do your
48:34 phd
48:36 so that also
48:38 gave some students the flexibility to
48:40 try different things to yeah
48:43 and identify what they like
48:46 the actually
48:48 maybe this is something you can also
48:49 help uh this is a question that comes up
48:51 in the community quite often maybe at
48:53 least uh once in a month
48:55 is uh especially during the times when
48:58 students need to select a topic but they
49:00 must start this is like how do i
49:03 actually select a topic
49:05 do you have any advice for those
49:07 students how can they
49:09 pick a topic for the
49:10 master's studies
49:12 for the thesis
49:17 yeah
49:18 um i mean yeah as i said at least that
49:21 in my group everybody advertises them
49:23 the topics right so
49:25 uh you don't have to come up like master
49:27 students don't really have to think from
49:29 scratch about the topic but they can go
49:32 through a list of advertised topics that
49:35 each of them comes with a description as
49:37 well right
49:40 so
49:42 i mean yeah i mean i would say again it
49:44 goes back to what uh you find
49:47 interesting
49:48 but also okay
49:50 one other aspect is to maybe also make
49:52 sure that you have enough background for
49:54 that topic because uh
49:56 um or if you don't that you
49:59 are aware of that and that you're really
50:01 prepared to you know cover the missing
50:04 background because otherwise it can be
50:06 like a bad negative experience to work
50:08 on something that um you don't have the
50:12 skill set for
50:13 um
50:15 so yeah and i mean then to some extent
50:17 sometimes also
50:19 who you're working with can be as
50:21 important as the topic
50:23 uh or in some cases even more so you
50:25 know i would also say to
50:27 uh be careful in choosing your mentor
50:31 and make sure that you
50:34 have a good uh
50:37 connection to that mentor and that
50:39 you're aligned in terms of how you work
50:41 together
50:43 so in practice it means basically
50:45 finding a phd student whose research you
50:48 like and then trying to see how you can
50:50 help them in their phd research right
50:54 yeah
50:55 at least this is how it was for me and
50:57 [Music]
50:58 this is how it works
51:00 i remember
51:02 we had like a
51:04 sort of meeting and then phd students
51:06 would come and pitch the topics that
51:08 they're working on and then whoever
51:10 likes the topic would come then and
51:12 directly approach the
51:13 phd students saying hey i like what
51:16 you're working on let's
51:18 do something
51:19 yeah yeah that's true because yeah i
51:21 mean phd students are also involved in
51:22 teaching
51:23 so
51:24 it's actually an opportunity for like
51:26 master and bachelor students to interact
51:28 with them and see what they're working
51:29 on and yeah have some discussions
51:33 about potential
51:34 topics
51:36 so in that sense you can also
51:38 cover what i said that
51:40 um like you want to have a mentor that
51:43 you're happy with because you actually
51:45 can work with a person that you are
51:47 already familiar because you
51:50 had that person as a teacher in some
51:53 course
51:53 and to me it happens a lot that the
51:55 students that end up doing a thesis with
51:57 me they are students that already know
51:59 me from some course where i was involved
52:02 they're not complete strangers
52:05 okay
52:06 and
52:07 what advice would you give to somebody
52:09 who is just graduating from masters and
52:11 they are not sure
52:13 whether they want to do continue
52:15 researching and do a phd or they just
52:17 want to work
52:19 in the industry
52:20 um
52:22 i think this is quite a difficult
52:23 problem like i remember for me it was a
52:25 different decision like do you have any
52:28 suggestion or
52:29 advice
52:30 for people who need to decide to help
52:33 them do this
52:35 um
52:37 i mean yeah to some extent it's a bit
52:39 what i already said which is already
52:41 like give it a try
52:44 but like at the smaller scale so before
52:47 uh before you start the phd to try to do
52:49 some research either in your master's or
52:51 like as part of an internship
52:53 and i mean one important thing that
52:55 comes with that is that you can have
52:57 more fun actually doing research and in
52:59 your phd because there's also less
53:00 pressure
53:01 there is no pressure to publish doing
53:04 research in your master's is completely
53:06 optional
53:07 there is no you know clock ticking
53:09 telling you that in three years you need
53:10 to publish three papers
53:12 so you actually can have more fun
53:15 i think
53:16 um
53:17 and
53:18 i mean then the same way so i am someone
53:20 that unfortunately doesn't have industry
53:22 experience but i mean i would say the
53:23 same way also you can try to do some
53:25 internships also in in industry right
53:29 and
53:32 yeah work
53:33 also for some companies so
53:35 you know you try both and then hopefully
53:38 it will become clear what you like
53:40 more um
53:43 yeah
53:45 yeah so doing these and then also doing
53:47 internships and like seeing what you
53:50 like
53:52 [Music]
53:54 yeah that's actually a good point about
53:56 uh
53:57 no pressure to publish because i
53:59 remember like when i was writing my
54:00 thesis
54:01 uh we decided to publish it as a paper
54:04 after i graduated
54:06 uh so it was uh
54:08 it was a lot uh you know nobody forced
54:10 me like hey write this paper or you will
54:13 not graduate uh you will not get your
54:15 masters but in with phd if you don't
54:18 write your paper then you do not
54:20 graduate right
54:21 yeah with no publications um you cannot
54:24 graduate
54:25 yeah that's
54:27 because with a master thesis you just
54:28 defend it and then your advisor
54:31 supervisor says okay like this is uh
54:33 this kind of mark and then the
54:36 the people the jury who
54:38 who watch the defense they say okay yeah
54:40 this is the mark and then you get your
54:43 your papers right
54:46 so with phd you still have to do that
54:48 but on top of that you need to have like
54:50 uh
54:52 quite a bunch of papers published in top
54:54 venues right
54:56 yeah
54:57 that stuff
54:58 and yeah different groups have different
55:00 requirements in terms of you know how
55:02 many papers you are expected to publish
55:05 but yeah in general
55:07 it's always at least one i mean probably
55:09 speaking i mean at the mines typically
55:11 actually three and like
55:13 three uh top conferences so it is uh not
55:17 easy
55:18 and one last thing i wanted to ask you
55:21 and this is actually uh something we
55:23 also talked with
55:24 a guest a few podcasts ago so with
55:26 barbara who is taking part in women in
55:30 data science
55:32 community so and there um
55:36 the question some of the
55:38 somebody from the audience had to cure
55:40 is like how can we promote uh
55:43 computer science to
55:45 female students because this is not very
55:47 popular among female students and
55:50 in general data science computer science
55:52 these are
55:53 like i would say male dominated areas
55:57 what do you think we can do to attract
55:58 more female students to research in
56:00 computer science
56:02 yeah so yeah this is a topic like you
56:04 know that uh i like to talk about and i
56:08 personally also find it very important
56:10 um and um yeah there are a lot of
56:13 discussions on that topic so i will
56:16 actually try them to give my personal
56:18 experience and perspective uh and share
56:21 with you uh you know what attracted me
56:23 personally to first study computer
56:25 science and then first your career in
56:27 research and then try to see how this uh
56:30 how this could apply uh more generally
56:32 for other women as well so okay to begin
56:35 with uh in my case my choice was
56:37 influenced by my father actually because
56:39 he's a professor of computer science in
56:41 greece so in my case it was a little bit
56:43 i was a bit lucky let's say i had this
56:45 influence in my home
56:46 uh but then like now taking this to the
56:48 general case i think it is important
56:51 that we organize events uh for you know
56:54 younger
56:55 students in high school or even primary
56:57 school in particular female ones but it
57:00 can like these events could be addressed
57:01 to all students
57:03 where
57:04 we can
57:05 they can
57:06 students can see
57:08 what computer science is but in a very
57:10 gender neutral way and
57:12 yeah i really want to put emphasis on
57:15 this you know gender neutrality uh
57:17 because i think it is really crucial
57:19 that the students um
57:21 stop making this association in their
57:23 minds uh that computer science is only
57:26 meant you know for giga guys that's it i
57:28 don't know in their basements uh wearing
57:30 glasses and like dirty t-shirts and
57:33 you know i'm like over-exaggerating now
57:35 the stereotype from the other side but i
57:36 mean this is how cs is often like
57:39 depicted in the pop culture right and i
57:41 mean
57:42 in the movies yes i mean inevitably this
57:45 actually uh influences people uh but
57:49 yeah i think so i think you know in
57:51 these young ages it is really important
57:53 for students to realize that you know
57:55 your gender and your fashion choices
57:57 are like completely relevant and just
57:59 focus on the essence
58:01 um now
58:03 again going back to my personal
58:05 experience um
58:07 so yeah as i said you know through my
58:09 father i
58:10 got attracted to the field but i mean
58:12 later on uh when i was doing my phd uh
58:15 for me it was quite helpful that my phd
58:17 advisor was actually a woman
58:19 so in that sense i had a female role
58:21 model
58:23 and actually even more what helped me
58:25 was the fact that a lot of my phd peers
58:28 in my group were also a female
58:32 to me this was actually more helpful
58:34 because i could more easily relate to
58:37 other women around my age who were just
58:40 like one or two steps ahead of me and i
58:41 could feel that you know i'm not alone
58:44 and that if they are successful then i
58:46 can also be successful
58:48 uh so again extrapolating what this
58:50 means in general i think it is important
58:53 for universities to employ females
58:55 at all levels uh as professors but also
58:58 to make sure that they're also female
58:59 posters and female phd students
59:02 um yeah
59:04 and yeah maybe finally
59:07 the hardest part is to actually keep
59:09 women in research and more specifically
59:12 in academic research in the long run i
59:15 mean if you look um there are like all
59:17 these different studies that show that
59:19 uh
59:20 in the current
59:21 situation at every stage women are more
59:24 likely to drop out than men
59:26 uh you know so to begin with we don't
59:28 have so many uh master students when
59:30 they get even fewer at the phd level
59:32 even here at the foster level and even
59:34 here at the you know professor level uh
59:37 and um yeah i think for me this is maybe
59:40 the hardest problem
59:42 um
59:44 and yeah it happens because it's quite
59:45 hard to combine creating a family with
59:47 the academic expectations that require
59:50 you to be mobile and change cities or
59:53 countries until you get a permanent
59:55 position
59:56 while also you have to work long hours
1:00:00 so yeah this is one of the hardest
1:00:02 problems i think to solve of course some
1:00:04 solutions go towards the direction of
1:00:06 having better child care and support for
1:00:09 women
1:00:10 but yeah i mean my feeling is it somehow
1:00:12 goes beyond that and that somehow
1:00:15 universities need to acknowledge and be
1:00:16 aware of the additional challenges uh
1:00:19 that women make
1:00:21 may face in their personal lives and
1:00:23 yeah make some adjustments for that
1:00:26 we should start with schools right like
1:00:28 you said uh yeah we have these events
1:00:31 and uh
1:00:32 i guess if uh
1:00:33 if this event like somebody who comes
1:00:36 and presents
1:00:37 is uh
1:00:38 um the presenter is
1:00:41 a guy like you know in this t-shirt like
1:00:43 described like you described and then
1:00:46 so maybe it's helpful to have a female
1:00:48 uh
1:00:49 presenter as well right no i mean this i
1:00:52 can really tell you this from my
1:00:53 personal experience that this problem is
1:00:54 real i mean when i was younger and i was
1:00:57 starting with my phd i mean i somehow
1:00:59 really
1:01:00 felt that okay
1:01:01 um
1:01:02 the way i dress and you know the fact
1:01:05 that i don't know i wear makeup and all
1:01:06 that like
1:01:08 it's somehow incompatible with me being
1:01:09 in computer science i mean it's maybe a
1:01:11 sign that i'm actually not good for that
1:01:13 which is crazy but i mean i
1:01:15 like going back i can really see that i
1:01:17 was to some extent making these stars
1:01:19 feeling that i don't fit in the
1:01:21 stereotype right and that this is
1:01:22 probably because i'm doing something
1:01:24 wrong not because the stereotype is
1:01:26 wrong but because there's something
1:01:27 wrong with me so
1:01:28 um it's um yeah
1:01:31 it can have an impact
1:01:33 yeah so we should be wrapping up
1:01:36 if people have questions to you how can
1:01:39 they find you
1:01:40 well like i guess you
1:01:42 um
1:01:43 i mean i you have already shared i think
1:01:45 my information on your website right
1:01:48 something
1:01:50 to the demo page with all your contacts
1:01:52 yeah i mean this information is up to
1:01:55 date only i guess uh yeah there is my
1:01:57 email on my website so i guess that's
1:02:00 the easiest way
1:02:01 okay thanks a lot thanks for joining us
1:02:04 today thanks for sharing your story
1:02:06 thanks for telling us about the work
