0:00 hi everyone Welcome to our event this
0:01 event is brought to you by datadox club
0:03 which is a community of people who love
0:04 data we have weekly events and today is
0:07 one of such events if you want to find
0:09 out more about the events we have there
0:10 is a link in the description go there
0:12 click on this link and you'll see all

0:19 miss out on any future streams as
0:22 awesome as this one today and we have an
0:24 amazing slack Community where you can
0:26 hang out with data with other data
0:28 enthusiasts so check it out if you
0:30 haven't registered do it now and during
0:32 today's interview you can ask any
0:34 question you want there is a pinned Link
0:36 in the live chat click on this link ask
0:38 your questions and we will be covering
0:40 these questions during the interview
0:42 that's all I think if you wake up me at
0:46 I don't know 2 A.M I will be able to say
0:49 what I just said without you know
0:52 turning my brain on can I can I make can
0:55 I pick on you for a little bit and say
0:56 if you do have a slack it's full of data
0:58 that I can hang out with
1:02 um so
1:03 recommendations and feedback yeah are
1:07 welcome
1:08 so
1:09 um now I should open the questions we
1:12 prepared for you
1:14 and
1:16 I guess start
1:18 right if you're ready no time like the
1:21 present okay so this week we'll talk
1:24 about industrial data challenges and we
1:26 have a special guest today Rosanna
1:28 Rosanna is a 2020 petition who works in
1:31 the data space space in the last six
1:34 years and with lastly working in
1:36 industrial data she is currently a
1:38 machine learning engineer with technical
1:40 technical leadership role around
1:41 synthetic tabular data in an AI
1:45 Innovation team and she is particularly
1:47 intrigued by industrial r d problems
1:51 and yeah welcome to uh to our one today
1:55 Arizona
1:57 thanks for the the invitation
1:59 I'm glad that it finally worked out
2:00 we've been trying to schedule for a year
2:03 or maybe more it was always um fun March
2:06 it was with you yeah yeah well anyways
2:09 so every time we spoke previously you
2:11 always had an opinion about many
2:13 interesting topics so today we finally
2:15 have a chance to put this on the record
2:17 and have a podcast interview about that
2:21 um the questions for today's interview
2:23 are prepared by Johanna Byer thanks a
2:25 lot Johanna for your help and yeah
2:28 before we go into our main topic of
2:31 industrial data challenges let's start
2:33 with your background
2:34 can you tell us about your career
2:36 Journey so far
2:37 uh I mean you you gave sort of a the
2:40 broad Strokes right uh I was originally
2:42 a a PhD mathematician this is actually
2:45 what brought me to Germany was an
2:47 academic career I uh I did several
2:49 post-docs first in Hamburg
2:51 and
2:53 um
2:54 you reached a point where either it's
2:56 gonna work or it's not relative to your
2:58 constraints in your life and uh so I
3:00 decided okay industry it is uh and then
3:03 that's been about six years I've tried
3:06 many roles I sometimes tell people
3:08 looking at my career path looks kind of
3:11 like I'm a data Roomba like let's try
3:13 this I go with this direction and I hit
3:15 a block
3:16 Roomba you know those vacuum machines
3:18 that you
3:20 you don't a robot a robot that cleans
3:22 your house except I'm you know that
3:24 makes me sound like I'm a data cleaner
3:25 by trade which I'm not but I mean just
3:27 sort of like
3:28 there was intention which is more than I
3:30 could say for a robot I guess but uh or
3:32 this particular robot but I um I
3:34 explored a lot of things and each each
3:36 time I pivoted someone uh on LinkedIn
3:39 was saying you know have a goal and then
3:40 you know you have to keep pivoting and
3:42 yeah sure but you should also adjust the
3:44 goal as you go you know before you get
3:46 an industry you don't really know what
3:47 it means to be an industry
3:49 um so
3:51 right and anyway uh uh
3:55 mixture of things financial data CRM
3:58 data
3:59 um
4:01 and then industrial data about three
4:02 years ago a contract position for about
4:04 nine months to a year and then um and
4:07 then where I am now permanently and I
4:09 think industrial data this is something
4:10 that's really frustrating with me and
4:12 why I wanted to do this topic is I feel
4:14 like we're ignored by a lot of tools and
4:16 a lot of demos and I you get kind of
4:18 tired of being that person in the in the
4:20 audience being like but what about our
4:22 use case
4:23 foreign
4:24 so I'm here to say we have all of this
4:27 data it's cool we have great challenges
4:29 if you're looking for a new area uh or
4:32 you know in the future what might you do
4:34 an industry this is a great place that I
4:37 think is uh under
4:39 Representatives maybe in the in the
4:41 space of events also uh caveat I have to
4:45 say I'm here as a private person so none
4:47 of my opinions are those of my employer
4:49 I will do my very best not to
4:51 uh use profanity but I make no promises
4:55 what did you actually research as a
4:59 mathematician oh I meant to have a prop
5:01 can I get off camera and come back
5:03 is that okay all right
5:13 I'm really curious what happens next
5:22 originally I was going to be at my desk
5:23 and I would have had this there so I
5:25 didn't plan for that part
5:27 this is the shortest answer
5:31 um who do not see the video because we
5:34 will also release it as Audio Only so
5:36 what is that I actually don't know I
5:38 think we'll see the video also maybe
5:40 maybe people wonder
5:43 ing
5:44 these are three 3D printed topological
5:47 spaces this is an inverted sphere uh and
5:50 then I think this might be America's
5:52 type right yeah I think so but actually
5:55 I think it's like equivalent but it's
5:56 not actually the same like geometrically
5:58 it's different but topologically it is
5:59 so that's the long answer to the short
6:02 answer of I was an algebraic topologist
6:04 I was way off in like the far have you
6:06 seen the xkcd where he's got like
6:08 applied feels and he's got you know I
6:10 don't know like
6:11 sociologist scientists
6:14 engineers and then way over here as
6:16 mathematicians if you did the same graph
6:19 and then but inside of mathematics I
6:22 feel like topology especially algebraic
6:24 topology especially my like sub
6:25 sub-discipline is way is similarly like
6:28 way off the deep end like hey guys we're
6:30 over here
6:32 um
6:33 so the study of spaces and uh some
6:37 people call it rubber sheet geometry
6:39 um it was fun
6:42 inverting spheres there you go
6:46 um there is actually applied algebraic
6:47 topology but that's not what I did but
6:49 if you're excited about hey this sounds
6:51 cool what can I do maybe go that way I
6:53 can name my first advisor was Rob Grist
6:56 who had unchanged to any more pure
6:59 discipline but he's a lot of cool
7:00 presentations
7:02 so one of these was uh
7:05 you had a lot of you knew still know a
7:08 lot of mathematics one of these
7:09 mathematics was actually useful for your
7:11 industrial career
7:14 sorry I should
7:17 this is not fair because this is totally
7:19 not a question it's also a little mean I
7:21 say I feel like I'm sorry we can skip
7:23 that one no no it's fine it's fine it
7:26 just reminds me I had this interview
7:27 with uh with a group of I'm not gonna
7:29 name obviously the employer but a group
7:31 of Applied mathematicians that I came
7:33 into this interview and they're like how
7:35 did you end up in I.T like okay hostile
7:37 environment
7:38 because I'm curious like probably it was
7:41 very useful when you were picking up
7:43 some basics of machine learning but
7:46 um maybe not all of that right yeah but
7:49 I think this is also a deeper question
7:51 of how is mathematics useful and what is
7:53 mathematics and I think most no I'm dead
7:55 serious give me a like I'll second to
7:57 address this
7:58 um I think most of what we learned in
8:00 school of mathematics isn't mathematics
8:01 and what really is mathematics to me is
8:03 thinking logically and what what I bring
8:05 so really but another question that I
8:08 like better is what do you bring as as a
8:10 peer mathematician into this space and I
8:13 think
8:14 um it's really
8:17 in math especially in pure math in a
8:21 really Niche disciplinable people are
8:22 not willing to repeat themselves
8:25 um you have one chance to learn
8:27 something from someone right you're at a
8:28 conference there's that fancy guy over
8:30 there and you're like oh my God he wrote
8:31 this paper where she wrote that paper I
8:33 need to talk to them and you have maybe
8:35 40 minutes of their time if you're lucky
8:36 probably 20 maybe 10. right and you have
8:39 to optimize like the thing I want to
8:41 know and what questions to ask and like
8:43 have I answered these questions
8:46 and these are really valuable skills I
8:48 think just going in and understanding
8:50 what questions to ask how do you learn
8:53 enough about something to sort of keep a
8:56 model of it in your head and then and
8:58 then here's the pure math part say
9:01 how is this going to break
9:03 because this is the difference between a
9:04 proof and a simulation like when you try
9:06 to prove things that you're actually not
9:07 trying to prove something I'm not out
9:08 there being like here's my argument for
9:10 why you should vote this way I'm out
9:12 there trying to first see why will this
9:14 fail
9:15 and then fill those holes and that's
9:17 incredibly valuable and I think
9:19 something the biggest thing I bring as a
9:21 peer mathematician is this proof
9:22 viewpoint
9:25 for how long did you actually do this
9:29 academics mathematics yeah oh haha I
9:33 mean
9:34 um
9:35 you mean from the from the point I
9:37 decided to to study pure mathematics
9:39 that was like two years of undergrad
9:41 plus seven years of Master's plus PhD
9:44 plus six years of post-doc
9:47 okay that's a lot off my time it's a lot
9:49 it's a full career I think this is also
9:51 something that makes it really difficult
9:52 jumping to the end of the talk to what's
9:55 it like being you know what's this
9:57 transition like
9:59 um
10:00 I think it's very
10:01 people don't know how to where to put
10:03 you right because you're lopsided right
10:05 you have this whole career in a
10:06 completely separate space
10:08 so you're a senior you're obviously
10:09 senior I mean look at your age look at
10:11 how long you've been working but you
10:12 aren't senior in a business sense right
10:14 there's a lot of things you don't know
10:15 right you comment and maybe you don't
10:17 know SQL or whatever you can learn it
10:19 obviously but you're this weird lopsided
10:22 human that people have to
10:25 figure out how to how do I deal with
10:27 this development of this person
10:29 yeah if you can invert this fear then
10:31 SQL is like minutes right it's very easy
10:34 too
10:36 okay
10:37 so we actually here wanted to talk about
10:40 industrial data so what is industrial
10:43 data what is it so let me let me first
10:46 uh make a caveat that I uh I'm really I
10:50 really like this topic I'm working this
10:52 topic but I think there are obviously
10:53 people who are who are super experts on
10:55 this so before I offend anybody
10:57 industrial data is not a monolith
11:00 um and this is I think it's a great
11:01 question what is it and it's very broad
11:04 so let me let me say the simplest answer
11:06 is an a productive industry generates
11:09 the data
11:11 um and it's data that doesn't match
11:12 everything right but not really right
11:15 I I I I fight that CRM data does not
11:19 fall under this HR data does not fall
11:21 under this obviously you have this data
11:23 but it does not fall into
11:25 this process that generates data like so
11:28 somebody is hired and okay there's a new
11:30 record sure but it's not it's not like I
11:33 have a thing that I'm trying to make
11:36 so I mean like in the industries like
11:38 the chemical industry or
11:41 um
11:42 the semiconductor industry or
11:46 um our friends in the automobile
11:47 industry like people who have a thing
11:49 that they sell at the end of the day
11:52 um
11:53 a physical thing that they can clearly
11:56 like a program not a program not a
11:58 person not like like you know
12:01 recommendations on a website like an
12:04 actual physical thing
12:06 so it's
12:07 um like if there is a I don't know I
12:10 want to create paint blue paint right
12:12 there is a process for creating the
12:14 paint and
12:16 there is some data produced by this
12:17 process yes and when you work with this
12:20 data this is this is industrial data
12:22 right right and then within industrial
12:24 data I just want to like
12:29 R data which is small which is why
12:32 there's this like oh a small R data
12:34 because that's where I've historically
12:35 been sitting
12:36 um in I mean but I've been sort of half
12:38 half I've also done some of the what I
12:40 would call the productive so they're
12:41 sort of industrial r d where experiments
12:44 can be very expensive which is why it's
12:47 small data because it's expensive and
12:49 then you generate a process you develop
12:51 a process for a new product and then
12:53 there's like a like a pseudo plant where
12:56 you do this you run the process with a
12:59 lot of Q and C A lot of stopping it like
13:02 adjusting things like your your UNC
13:05 QC quality control where you stop it
13:08 good call I'm usually better about
13:09 abbreviations
13:11 right so you stop it and you adjust it
13:13 and you're developing the process of
13:15 making the thing right step one here's
13:17 the formulation for the thing step two
13:19 how do we actually do it and what
13:21 information do we need to record to make
13:23 sure that it's produced at a good
13:24 quality and then step three is we've
13:27 developed that process we've got it live
13:28 it's running and then there's live
13:30 quality controls that you have to do
13:32 like this machine has a part that welds
13:36 uh and it needs to be replaced regularly
13:39 other because it wears out how often
13:41 does it need to be replaced So like um
13:43 uh sort of productive maintenance or
13:45 planned maintenance kind of tasks happen
13:47 there so I would say they're sort of
13:48 broadly three large areas and then
13:51 within those there's all sorts of
13:52 directions people can go there's
13:54 agricultural stuff where data is
13:57 expensive because it just takes so long
13:58 you have to wait until corn grows
14:01 or
14:03 um
14:04 yeah uh toxicology you have to kill a
14:07 rat it's kind of expensive to kill
14:09 animals to measure the toxicology
14:11 there's I mean there's a lot of stuff
14:13 even not just r d but all over there's a
14:15 lot of directions
14:17 um
14:18 so I just want to summarize
14:21 of industrial data
14:24 first are are in the experiments like
14:27 these experiments are expensive so we
14:29 have very lethal data there then there
14:31 is a kind of production data that's the
14:33 other
14:34 side of the spectrum and then they think
14:36 in between I kind of missed it what was
14:38 that it's like it's like you make a sort
14:41 of uh I mean I haven't worked with this
14:43 myself I just know it exists and this is
14:45 how people have explained it to me I've
14:46 worked on the two extremes
14:48 um in the middle is sort of like a like
14:51 a mock-up of a running process in step
14:54 one of your r d you've started
14:56 developing this process step two is
14:57 maybe you've built the sketch of a plant
14:59 your plant's there what kind of proof
15:01 yeah like a POC like a tiny instead of a
15:04 whole giant Warehouse you've built a
15:06 room running this process and you're
15:07 trying to like fine-tune how this should
15:09 work
15:10 so if we talk if we take this example of
15:13 blue paint then the expensive experiment
15:17 part would be like trying different
15:18 chemical combining different chemicals
15:20 to see like the the
15:22 shade of blue is the right one right
15:24 then mock-up could be like how can we
15:27 combine it in a more automatic way right
15:29 and so exactly right how do we automate
15:31 this process how do we get the right
15:33 volume how do we make sure that it's
15:34 always this color blue
15:38 the color of paint also paint is like
15:42 it paints I mean color is a hard problem
15:44 as we all know having pain I've painted
15:46 a few apartments
15:47 okay
15:49 I don't know why I decided to use this
15:51 example because I think maybe like five
15:53 or six years ago I interviewed with a
15:54 company it was a chemical company in a
15:57 very small like uh German Village
16:00 and that was the only company in that
16:02 Village and it was like a huge company
16:04 huge Chemical Company and yeah they were
16:07 doing paints
16:09 it's a good example there's a lot of
16:11 cool stuff with paints there's actually
16:12 another reason why it's expensive as one
16:14 of the standard tests you do with paints
16:16 is that you it's called like the Florida
16:17 test and it's supposed to say I mean I
16:21 think originally it was like we leave it
16:22 out in Florida for 30 years but
16:23 obviously that's way too long for RND
16:25 links so you you paint some paint and
16:28 you send it to Florida and you let it
16:29 sit there for I don't know how long but
16:31 this is one of those I mean paint is a
16:34 big application
16:35 that's also an expensive experiment
16:37 right if you live in Germany yeah send
16:39 in something imagine yeah you have to
16:40 ship it to Florida
16:43 so Spain will not work right it has to
16:45 be full now there's something special
16:46 you can look it up I encourage people in
16:48 the audience to look up the Florida paid
16:49 test or whatever and there's like you
16:51 can see pictures of these huge fields
16:52 and I explained to you like there's
16:54 special subtract tropical environment
16:56 blah blah blah I don't know I don't know
16:58 I just know it exists and I was shocked
17:00 and you know
17:02 okay so we already discussed that the
17:06 industrial data is different from the
17:08 usual internet companies data so the
17:11 main difference is that there is a
17:14 physical process that creates a physical
17:16 thing most of the time in industrial
17:17 data like I don't know there is an
17:19 assembly line that creates a car right
17:22 while in usual internet companies data
17:25 there is like person comes clicks and
17:27 then there is recommendation and that's
17:29 yeah and I think I feel like it there's
17:32 also
17:35 it's hard to adjust what data you get
17:37 once it's in once it's productive
17:39 there's another thing that I think
17:40 there's a lot of things that seem to
17:42 surprise people and one of them is you
17:44 can have tons of data so on the
17:45 productive end somebody processes are
17:48 not designed with data in mind
17:49 necessarily which I think is a
17:51 difference with like CRM you run
17:52 experiments you can say what information
17:53 do we actually need about my customers
17:55 you can adjust what information you're
17:56 collecting
17:58 um very quickly and in Industry you
18:00 can't necessarily if your plants in
18:01 another country you first you need to
18:03 explain what it is you want them to do
18:04 but you might you know like I mean what
18:06 sensors are available to you there's
18:08 also issues of like you might have a
18:10 work floor where you've got a consistent
18:12 process but you have machines from four
18:14 different manufacturers and each machine
18:16 has different sensors in different
18:18 positions how much do you trust your
18:20 model that you're building with these
18:21 and then first you of course you have to
18:22 do cleaning and you have to like sort of
18:24 Center you know pull this data together
18:25 so that it it makes sense as a whole
18:29 can you maybe give an example I don't
18:31 know to what extent you can can be a
18:33 made-up example like of a process of
18:35 creating something
18:37 physical and then what kind of things we
18:39 can observe and record and use for
18:42 sure
18:44 um
18:45 I'm gonna make one up so this is a
18:47 made-up example I was thinking about
18:49 this like how do I make something up
18:50 because I'm obviously I should not talk
18:51 about work
18:53 um so what's something that we all uh
18:55 know and understand
18:57 um I went with packing peanuts
18:59 because
19:01 um this for me illustrates several
19:02 problems all at once
19:04 so if I'm I have no idea how you make
19:06 packing peanuts by the way I don't even
19:08 know yeah I mean you have peanuts and
19:10 then you want to pack them so oh no no
19:12 I'm sorry I thought this was a standard
19:13 phrase you know when you uh when you
19:15 open a box that's been shipped to you
19:17 and it's not and it's not there's
19:19 various ways to pack things one of them
19:21 is with uh those big cushions of air uh
19:25 and one of them there's these little
19:26 styrofoam
19:27 yeah so it's not actual peanuts they
19:30 look they look sort of vaguely like a
19:31 peanut that's what we call them this
19:33 package I got overly excited I thought
19:35 we would stop saltiness okay that would
19:38 oh black and that is also a process that
19:41 is you know you need to add salt or
19:44 roast them or whatever
19:48 um
19:49 production process so so I have no idea
19:52 how you make pack ing peanuts I'm just
19:53 gonna make up
19:54 a process because right okay packing
19:58 peanuts I'm gonna assume you extrude
20:01 them or something so there's someone
20:02 someone something is mixing something
20:03 some kind of polymer and then there's an
20:06 extruder that that spits it out here's
20:09 an extruder
20:10 um like imagine you're a toothpaste yeah
20:13 so you spray it okay
20:17 yeah instead of toothpaste you have like
20:19 this material yeah right and then maybe
20:21 something that cuts it off I don't know
20:22 maybe there's a mold how I mean maybe
20:24 it's a molding process so whoever
20:26 somebody is Gonna Come See this and with
20:28 a transcript and tell us you know in
20:30 next week how you make packing peanuts
20:33 but whatever we're gonna Pretend This is
20:35 how you make packing peanuts
20:37 um
20:38 all right
20:40 uh it gets extruded maybe it gets dried
20:43 um you obviously might collect them
20:44 together at some point right into a big
20:46 batch of packing peanuts and then
20:49 um now you have you ship those packing
20:51 peanuts off but obviously you need some
20:53 kind of you need to measure the quality
20:55 of your packing peanuts I don't know
20:56 what's important what's important about
20:57 pecking peanuts that they actually take
20:59 up space I guess but they're not and
21:01 then they're like
21:02 um
21:04 yeah yeah
21:06 they crumble that they're not wet I
21:08 guess that would be good but let's let's
21:10 just say
21:11 um I want to make sure that they are not
21:13 flattened maybe flattening is a big
21:15 problem like you've extrude them and
21:17 they dry wrong I don't know
21:18 um how can I measure this so at this
21:20 point okay
21:22 um you know I've got some sensors I can
21:24 put there's I think I feel like visual
21:26 sensors are always expensive and kind of
21:30 but I don't know if it's true but my
21:31 impression from what kind of data is
21:33 available is that other kinds of sensors
21:35 are cheaper and easier to deal with
21:37 um like you might have
21:40 um weight I guess you know like it's
21:42 rolling along the a belt and there's a
21:44 weight sensor underneath it and it says
21:46 suddenly there was a drop in weight and
21:47 like okay what happened
21:49 actually get extruded maybe just think
21:51 that uh you know excludes them like it's
21:55 gonna measure the volume
21:56 like how much each time sure yeah you
21:58 can yeah there you go you can measure
21:59 like each with each one is the volume
22:01 consistent
22:03 I don't know 10 grams or whatever liters
22:06 milliliters milliliters I don't want a
22:08 10 liter packing peanut
22:11 um right
22:14 um so you want to talk about every step
22:16 of this process but you have to decide
22:18 right like there's a person designing
22:19 this process this is also the thing the
22:21 person designing the process is not
22:23 optimizing for the data
22:25 collection necessarily I feel like it's
22:28 generally an afterthought I have had
22:29 this told to me by someone who runs a
22:31 huge process that data is an
22:33 afterthought
22:35 um and they're working on it this is
22:36 like an industry-wide oh yeah we should
22:38 really work on this problem it's
22:39 changing but in general historically
22:42 when you design a workflow you're what
22:43 you're optimizing for is you don't want
22:46 the people doing the things to cross
22:48 paths too many times right otherwise
22:50 they're going to slow things down by
22:52 running into each other so you divide
22:53 design your your your shop floor full of
22:57 machines and processes to minimize
23:00 um people running into each other but
23:02 that can make data collection and
23:03 identification and
23:05 um tracking difficult why would you
23:08 track one peanut you wouldn't track one
23:10 peanut right I wouldn't care about one
23:12 peanut I care about maybe like 10 grams
23:14 of peanuts but then that's that's sort
23:16 of tough because at each stage of the
23:17 process maybe they get mixed up right
23:19 maybe you have data at the beginning
23:21 that says this peanut way was made with
23:24 10 milliliters of whatever gunk
23:27 and then later on the process you have
23:30 um you know
23:31 10 kilos of peanuts and you can you can
23:35 say
23:36 um
23:36 I guess what their weight is and then
23:39 okay well how do I know what peanuts
23:41 were in here how do I how do I pull this
23:43 data together is that it makes sense all
23:45 together this sort of coarseness and
23:47 fineness of data and that you sort of
23:49 mix things with processes that mix them
23:51 together like when you're drying you can
23:52 imagine you put them in some big thing
23:54 and they dry and then you like have some
23:56 kind of cycle to squish them around mesh
23:59 them around and then
24:01 yeah so I think I feel like coarseness
24:03 and fineness of data is a problem
24:05 um I mean how you model the data when
24:08 you finally want to work with it is a
24:09 problem or a challenge sorry a challenge
24:11 I mean it's exciting it's really cool I
24:13 mean there's also processes where I mean
24:15 I was told sawing when you cut things is
24:18 really messy
24:20 and it's a really hard it's a really
24:22 hard problem to solve how do you model
24:23 anything with a process that does
24:25 cutting because there's so much
24:27 vibration like whatever sensors you have
24:30 are going to have a lot of noise
24:33 we have this process then this process
24:37 produced a lot of produces a lot of data
24:39 and not necessarily all the data we need
24:41 but
24:43 um what I now wonder is why do we
24:45 actually care about this data do we want
24:47 to
24:47 make sure that the quality is good do we
24:49 want to make sure that nothing breaks or
24:52 what's the so on the productive end
24:54 definitely quality I mean for the
24:56 research end it's like how do I make the
24:58 best product
25:01 um and then on the product production
25:03 like it's it's gone live what am I doing
25:05 well um maybe these I don't know maybe
25:08 this thing that you're doing gets turned
25:10 into something else later I mean this is
25:11 often in the productive industry the
25:12 case right you don't you do you I
25:14 wouldn't buy a semiconductor but I see I
25:17 suppose I could right but I buy
25:18 something that has this chip in it right
25:20 and what you worry about is how do
25:23 things like how do my QC parameters how
25:25 do my quality control what does my
25:27 quality control tell you about the
25:28 quality control of the downstream
25:30 product
25:32 um that's a big challenge this is
25:34 something why do you care but things
25:36 like okay maybe packing peanuts are a
25:37 terrible example but I mean I don't want
25:39 to ship a box full of flattened packing
25:40 peanuts because then they don't uh do
25:43 their job and so yeah quality control
25:45 going out quality control coming in of
25:48 the product we're using to make our
25:49 product
25:51 um
25:51 also yeah stuff like like can I improve
25:53 processes uh like this example with I
25:56 have a machine that's doing something
25:57 and it needs to be changed regularly
25:58 usually you do this I mean often you do
26:00 this with just a rule of thumb but maybe
26:04 the costs are are I mean especially now
26:06 right maybe even costs are so so much of
26:07 a pressure that you really want to
26:09 optimize this process and change this
26:11 part one less time a day if possible and
26:14 so you need to keep an eye on is this
26:16 process producing anomalous pieces right
26:18 how good is the quality is it within the
26:19 range I need
26:21 so basically we use it we use this data
26:24 for monitoring I guess definitely like
26:27 for example like we have one uh kilo or
26:30 one liter of the material from which the
26:33 peanuts are produced and then we
26:35 expected you know one kilo out right
26:37 sure or whatever volume and we can
26:40 monitor it right and then we see okay
26:42 like something is happening because we
26:44 still
26:45 um put one kilo in one liter in but then
26:48 something is happening you know we have
26:50 less or more or whatever right then
26:53 there are some charts and we can observe
26:54 this
26:56 um that's one thing is like monitoring
26:58 the process making sure that things do
27:01 not go wrong and if something goes wrong
27:03 some of the metrics I don't know debate
27:06 from the usual things you notice that
27:08 until you can detect an anomaly and then
27:10 you can do something with this right
27:12 maybe send the technician to check
27:13 what's happening
27:17 right and then I'm just here adding yeah
27:20 the other thing is you mentioned like
27:24 what was that like maybe qualities of
27:26 this thing like the the when you squash
27:29 them they need to recover shape right so
27:31 then how do we actually maybe there is a
27:34 part of the process that does that and
27:35 we also record so I think um I mean
27:38 sometimes not every process has we
27:41 should also talk about tiny data we
27:42 should see if we should we should also
27:44 talk about r d but this one's much
27:45 easier because I think it's it's
27:47 understandable
27:49 um faster but
27:51 my impression is there's there's two
27:53 kinds of quality controls sort of um
27:55 live
27:56 on the conveyor belt or whatever like
27:58 during the process you take a picture
28:00 and keep going and you leave the thing
28:02 in the line and there's a second kind
28:06 where you destroy the product
28:09 okay yeah so that answers your question
28:11 which is how do you tell if this is
28:13 viscous enough or whatever you take the
28:15 thing out and you squish it
28:18 I used to you take your or you'd imagine
28:21 this giant bit of packing peanuts and
28:23 you take your your shovel and you go in
28:25 and you examine one shovel full of them
28:27 and destroy that so that you're only
28:29 impacting a small percentage of what
28:31 you're actually producing
28:34 and then of course there's a whole
28:35 science around how much of a sample do I
28:37 need how often do I need this sample
28:39 um statisticians have certainly been
28:41 working on this for a while
28:42 so what I was going to ask is um as a
28:44 data person what do you do with this
28:46 data how do you use it like do you build
28:49 all these anomaly detection uh models
28:51 that we just talked about or there is
28:53 more
28:54 I mean you can certainly there's also
28:56 there's people who uh so adjacent to
28:59 data science or maybe in the broader
29:01 data science family you can also talk
29:03 about like hamometrics people who are
29:05 computational scientists I would I would
29:07 I don't know how they would like to
29:09 describe themselves
29:10 um where they actually have the
29:12 scientific background and have models
29:14 for
29:16 um
29:17 you know based on this measurements what
29:19 do I expect about this quality of this
29:20 product
29:22 um so certainly each time I mean imagine
29:25 when you have physically have to reach
29:27 in and look at things
29:29 um and touch them right it's it's
29:30 expensive and anything you can automate
29:33 is great whether that's
29:35 um and and my experience talking to
29:37 people has been primarily quality
29:40 control I mean I'm sure there's other
29:41 things right like predictive maintenance
29:42 and things like
29:44 um anomaly detection why do you care
29:46 about anomaly detection if or maybe sort
29:49 of volume of anomalies if suddenly you
29:51 go from your process has a five percent
29:53 failure rate to a 20 failure rate this
29:56 is bad right and then it's but it's not
29:59 something that you can it's like a
30:01 pre-warning right it's like you're you
30:03 you your role is to give them a flag
30:05 that says something's horribly wrong
30:08 and then they tend to have to they then
30:11 someone has to make the decision about
30:12 what you do about it
30:14 um do you stop the machine do you stop
30:16 the process that also costs money
30:18 um and those are things I don't it
30:19 really depends on the situation what
30:21 people need and what you can do
30:23 I have no idea how it works in this
30:26 industry but in internet companies where
30:29 I worked usually there's a problem right
30:32 so something
30:34 I don't know like there's a problem
30:35 users complain or I don't know we want
30:37 to improve something right then we think
30:40 okay what kind of data we have for that
30:41 and if there is data good we just use
30:44 this data and try to see if we can use
30:46 this data to solve this problem if there
30:47 was no data we need to collect this data
30:49 and then eventually hope that it will be
30:52 enough to solve the problem does it look
30:54 similar similarly similar in industrial
30:57 data like I don't know there is a
30:59 problem that we need to make sure that
31:02 the percentage of defects is at least oh
31:06 less than you know one percent and then
31:10 I was thinking in answer to what you
31:12 were just saying I was thinking like a
31:13 new requirement right so like you're
31:15 you're Downstream customer says actually
31:17 we really want to know
31:19 we really want to track X right we have
31:22 some kind of I don't know sustainability
31:23 requirements and then suddenly it's like
31:25 a new requirement and then the first
31:27 thing is does our data tell us that
31:30 right can we actually answer your
31:31 question with our data and if we can't
31:34 what do we need to do do we need to add
31:36 a sensor is it one just one sensor can
31:38 we get away with one can we like add a
31:40 camera you know can we bring in some
31:41 computer vision guys uh and gals
31:44 um
31:45 yeah
31:46 well what kind of requirements you
31:49 mentioned sustainability like it means
31:51 that uh I know the process we have for
31:53 producing this packing peanuts is not uh
31:56 too bad for the environment right so
31:58 there is not much emission I mean so
32:00 let's let's pick another industry that
32:02 I'm further away from and like uh like I
32:05 imagine you know like I think the the
32:07 airlines uh and also uh you know the the
32:10 train companies have started saying
32:12 we're we're sustainable or whatever
32:14 um how are they guaranteeing that or man
32:17 I bought something recently that said
32:18 we're 100 sustainable your T-shirt right
32:20 there you go that's I mean clothing is
32:22 technically also a manufacturing
32:24 industry
32:25 um how do they certify that right like
32:27 okay the person making the shirt is
32:29 taking Fabric and thread and whatever
32:32 from from different customers and
32:34 putting it all together and so they have
32:35 to go to each of them and say we want
32:37 this to be sustainable and then they
32:38 have to say what that means and I think
32:39 this is a developing label where people
32:43 say sustainable means XYZ and I don't
32:45 know what it means I haven't looked it
32:46 up I I just threw it out there as a word
32:48 um like maybe it means it has to be
32:50 organic maybe it means you have to be
32:52 CO2 neutral I don't know so you take
32:54 these requirements to your you know
32:56 cotton manufacturer and then they have
32:58 to go and see okay who do we buy our
33:00 cotton from
33:01 how do they uh like what are the
33:03 pesticides what are the you know
33:05 whatever blah blah blah blah uh do we
33:07 even know that I mean I feel like a lot
33:09 of the problem is we don't have the like
33:11 no one thought about this problem at the
33:13 time they developed the process and so
33:15 you have to figure out do can I
33:17 approximate you know can I create an
33:19 avatar that answers this question given
33:21 what I have or do I need to
33:24 um
33:25 figure out a way to to get that
33:27 information going forward
33:29 you have other examples different
33:31 examples for like this kind of uh
33:34 problems or
33:36 toxicology so my a friend of mine did
33:39 this with this well not toxicology what
33:41 he's doing like um brain research but
33:44 this is all just like any anything that
33:45 involves animal trials pharmacology I've
33:47 never worked in this field so this is
33:49 another one where I'm making things up
33:50 speculatively my apologies
33:53 it's supposed to be toxic no no but I
33:57 mean yeah no the paint can be toxic
33:59 right I mean lots of things could be
34:00 toxic
34:04 have have to
34:07 um
34:08 man right
34:10 uh you have I know in the states right
34:12 we have changing rules on what you what
34:15 you're allowed to have in various things
34:18 like right now at some point it came out
34:20 BPA is terrible so suddenly all the
34:23 plastics it's a it's a chemical okay
34:27 that's all I know all I know is that at
34:29 some point we hit this like oh no this
34:31 is terrible and so all the chemical uh
34:33 companies that made Plastics had to
34:35 suddenly make bpa-free plastics for food
34:38 safe things and then
34:41 um the sort of sudden reactive
34:44 so that's another example so right
34:46 toxicology so I was just thinking like
34:49 um laws change regulation changes right
34:52 the allowable amount of X in y changes
34:55 uh regularly and so you have to keep on
34:57 top of regulations what's allowed and
34:59 then okay can we still keep selling this
35:02 thing can we still keep producing this
35:03 thing with the current regulation can we
35:05 adjust our processes so that we have no
35:07 BPA or like only five percent BPA or we
35:11 just don't sell water bottles anymore
35:12 because we can't
35:14 avoid this
35:16 okay so there is a new requirement about
35:19 a certain uh I don't know percentage of
35:23 um certain elements BPA or whatever and
35:26 then you think okay now how do I measure
35:28 this and then maybe there is a sensor
35:30 that you can add to one of the pieces of
35:33 equipment equipment that you have yeah
35:35 it's actually a good transition into
35:37 like uh small data because at that point
35:41 if if there's a if there's a law that
35:42 says or well I don't think there was a
35:44 law about EPA but whatever if there's if
35:47 there's a customer demand or a law that
35:49 says we cannot have this this thing in
35:51 our product then you have to go back to
35:53 the drawing board I have to have to go
35:55 back into research and say can we
35:58 develop an equivalent product with
36:02 um similar enough properties without
36:05 using the substance foreign
36:23 [Laughter]
36:28 Natural Sciences right like people who
36:30 have a you know have spent many years at
36:33 a windowless office blowing things up
36:35 but losing fingers and you know whatever
36:39 maybe not losing fingers but
36:42 um
36:43 it's a really different kind of kind of
36:45 place and I think people really hyper
36:47 specialize into their area which is
36:49 great it's really valuable it's really
36:50 cool that people can explain to you like
36:52 like you give they give you a data set
36:54 and you're like man
36:55 this is really hard to model this and
36:58 they're like yeah we're not surprised
37:00 because blah blah blah blah like the way
37:02 that you even Define a measurement is
37:04 can be highly subjective
37:06 um right back to the point um
37:09 the question sorry you're gonna ask the
37:12 question was um yeah like how do there
37:14 is a new requirement which experiments
37:17 yes yeah we need to
37:19 change the process and I imagine like in
37:21 a traditional I mean in an internet
37:23 company it could be for example I don't
37:25 know four or five years gdpr appeared
37:27 and all of a sudden all of the processes
37:29 of collecting data needed to be
37:31 redesigned changed
37:33 and yeah
37:35 for us internet companies it meant that
37:38 going there changing the code and
37:40 thinking again like
37:42 do the new code we have and do the
37:45 processes we have now
37:47 satisfy the new requirements but it's
37:50 called it's all virtual right so it's
37:52 just changes in git or whatever but in
37:55 this case in in Industry so it's
37:57 actually actual scientists go in there
37:59 and starting experimenting with I don't
38:01 know different
38:02 chemicals or like other things
38:04 yeah
38:06 um if you're in a situation so going
38:07 back to your blue paint so let's say we
38:09 had our blue paint and uh suddenly it
38:11 came out that there's something in this
38:15 particular blue dye that's
38:18 I don't know exposed to
38:20 uh something water it's toxic I don't
38:24 know whatever something happens we have
38:25 to remove one of the components of this
38:27 of this um of this blue dye all
38:31 production on it gets stopped so we go
38:32 back to r d
38:34 so if it's something like that where
38:35 it's like you're redeveloping something
38:36 that's
38:38 um an interesting place to start because
38:39 then you do also have the old data right
38:41 you have the historic data you have the
38:43 experiments that got you there and maybe
38:45 you can reuse some of that data to help
38:46 you plan your next experiments what kind
38:48 of data
38:49 is there because it's different from the
38:51 sensors data we discussed yeah it's
38:53 super different yeah
38:55 like for example for paint or the
38:58 packing peanuts or whatever yeah
39:01 um why don't I I'll try to give you a
39:03 spectrum
39:04 uh oh that's a great example actually is
39:06 spectra uh but
39:09 um it depends on what stage of the
39:11 process we're at honestly my impression
39:13 is when you're and also so I uh
39:16 originally was doing
39:18 stuff with with okay well a year ago I
39:21 was working with polymers so I know a
39:22 little more about polymers and there's a
39:24 paper which I think I added the document
39:27 for like linked recommendations on
39:29 polymer informatics and its challenges
39:31 it's a very really cool field
39:34 um
39:35 and
39:37 uh right
39:39 so if you're doing something
39:43 with chemicals whether it's polymers or
39:45 not you
39:47 um you have
39:49 ingredients same for Pharma I mean I
39:51 this is these are two things two Fields
39:53 any any field that has chemicals right
39:55 you're also drug development right
39:57 um You have the ingredients that you put
39:59 together you have the the recipe of how
40:02 you make it like if you're baking a cake
40:03 right if I tell you this cake is made
40:06 out of I don't know this works with some
40:08 recipes but not all of them right like
40:09 cake is is actually chemistry but right
40:11 if I tell you it's like five eggs
40:15 um a mil 100 milliliters of milk a
40:19 hundred milliliters of flour I don't
40:20 know I've made something terrible some
40:22 terrible slurry right at this point but
40:23 if I just tell you the ingredients and
40:26 you know nothing about baking a cake
40:28 you're not going to be able to bake a
40:29 cake right so so there's effectively two
40:33 sets of data and I think one of them is
40:35 tends to be held secret which is one of
40:36 the challenges of industrial data I
40:38 wanted to come to which is that people
40:40 there are there's the data you are
40:42 allowed to see and there's the data that
40:43 you are not allowed to see
40:45 use a data person you are not allowed to
40:47 see some data yeah and usually the the I
40:51 mean so baking a cake right like sure
40:54 the ingredients tell you something they
40:56 tell you uh for instance if you are
40:57 Celiac if you're allergic or to gluten
41:02 um you know whether the cake contains
41:03 gluten so you can certainly do something
41:06 with this information but if you want to
41:08 study the cake process uh you know the
41:12 cake making process and figure out if
41:14 this cake is going to be tasty or not I
41:16 don't think I can tell you from the
41:17 ingredients if the cake is going to be
41:18 tasty
41:20 but what do you do with this information
41:22 so I imagine that there is a table so I
41:24 don't know there are different sorts of
41:26 ingredients with different eggs flour
41:29 milk and then the amount of eggs
41:32 for this cake you use 100 grams of this
41:36 thing like I don't know sugar for PC is
41:38 200 yeah and then like you record
41:41 everything you have within a database so
41:43 what do you do with this like at the end
41:45 maybe a predictive cake so you also
41:48 measure your stuff so there's there's
41:50 there's kinds of there's several kinds
41:52 of measurements you can make this is a
41:53 beautiful transition thank you for the
41:54 question
41:56 um
41:57 which uh okay
41:59 so there's like material properties
42:03 like hardness
42:06 there's different kinds of hardness
42:08 um viscosity which you can also
42:10 different kinds there's like surface
42:13 tension there's things where you can
42:14 pull it like I imagine I would use with
42:16 a cake I wouldn't pull my cake but
42:18 certainly if I were an industrial cake
42:19 baker they exist
42:21 I probably would pull the cake I
42:24 probably would measure how much force it
42:27 takes to pull my cake apart and then try
42:29 to like work out backwards does that
42:31 mean my cake is delicious right because
42:33 you can't just have people sit down and
42:35 eat cake all day you need like you need
42:37 approximations to that that tell you
42:40 something
42:41 um
42:42 right so there's material properties
42:44 uh like I guess a viscosity or like the
42:47 color
42:49 um moistness I don't know material
42:51 properties and then there's also like
42:53 application tests which are I've put
42:55 this thing into another thing and I've
42:56 done something to it
42:58 um so uh I don't have a good example of
43:01 the cake application test be ER
43:06 um maybe honestly something like you put
43:08 it in a box and you you ship it and then
43:10 you take it out in for like I don't know
43:12 you drive it around Germany for a month
43:14 with improper freeze you know improper
43:17 conditions and then you measure if it's
43:19 moldy like I could imagine that'd be
43:20 like an application test for like it's
43:22 more extended right it's not a pure
43:24 property of the cake it's something
43:25 you've done to it mm-hmm okay
43:28 everybody's gonna be like what are you
43:29 really talking about Rosanna I could
43:31 give you like I mean
43:34 um
43:37 yeah I don't know if I give you a real
43:38 example that's the thing but let's stick
43:40 to the cake example I think it's
43:42 um
43:42 yeah so what we record like in our data
43:46 set is the ingredients we use yes and
43:49 like how much of these ingredients we
43:51 use I guess then there are some
43:52 properties of the process that produces
43:55 uh the cakes and then there are all
43:58 these properties of the end result of
44:00 the cake like what happens if it's
44:02 stretch like um I don't know how much I
44:07 like this example of like we drive it
44:08 around Germany and then we measure if
44:09 it's small like all these things right
44:11 we do all these things and then maybe
44:13 one of the tests is actually I don't
44:15 know eating the cake or trying to cut it
44:16 and then see how much uh cutting it's
44:18 nice I like that how much things are
44:20 there thanks to The Cutting yeah
44:23 whatever that's how you do actually test
44:25 a cake right you put the knife in to see
44:26 if it's done
44:28 uh so then like I can imagine like 20 30
44:31 different tests right and they put all
44:33 this data in a database and
44:36 what what happens next
44:39 okay well first of all it's there and
44:41 they do whatever they do with it and I'm
44:43 I'm not a person because a data
44:45 scientist what do you do this as a data
44:46 scientist so at that point the reason
44:48 that they're coming to you is that they
44:50 want to optimize some things so this is
44:52 like I guess a a a slight Divergence too
44:56 if you like mathematical optimization or
44:58 if you learn mathematical optimization
45:00 there are tons of those problems in
45:01 industry and there's also a fight on
45:04 okay a gentle disagreement on whether
45:07 mathematical optimization falls under
45:10 the larger you know ml data science AI
45:14 world
45:15 putting those aside
45:18 um it's really important I also I mean I
45:20 had an interview somewhere else where
45:22 um it was like a like a traveling
45:23 salesman problem we have Logistics we
45:25 have you know 10
45:27 places where we store stuff we have you
45:29 know how many trucks do we need to get
45:32 things from A to B in the correct time
45:35 um you know we want to minimize that
45:36 obviously for various reasons and what
45:39 route should they take so this kind of
45:40 like planning like planning graph Theory
45:42 mathematical optimization these kind of
45:44 problems come in at this point
45:46 um
45:47 coming back to your actual question yeah
45:50 but they want to say they want the best
45:53 cake and they come to me and they say
45:54 they're like we want the best cake tell
45:57 us here's our data we've done our
45:58 experiments and what do they Define what
46:01 is best or yeah but but before that even
46:03 happens in an Ideal World let me tell
46:05 you the ideal the ideal workflow which
46:07 does not always happen is they first
46:09 come to you and say we want to run
46:10 experiments such that we can then
46:13 determine the best cake relatives to
46:16 these requirements and if they do that
46:18 then you can do a design of experiment
46:22 so I was thinking of a situation then
46:24 for example when um you bake a
46:27 cheesecake sometimes there could be
46:28 cracks in the cheesecake after she bake
46:30 and then maybe some of this could be
46:33 like minimizing cracks or there's no
46:34 questions right so you've got things
46:35 that you measured so what's like what do
46:37 they want to optimize they want maybe
46:39 the lowest cost possible relative to the
46:42 best taste and um
46:46 the best color right maybe you want a
46:49 shiny cake right if you've got like one
46:51 of those I don't know if you watch
46:52 baking shows but there's like these
46:54 baking shows where they make really
46:55 shiny cakes and I don't know why how
46:56 they're shiny but they do look really
46:58 tasty so maybe you want a shiny cake and
47:00 then you can measure the shininess
47:01 there's a way to measure that using
47:03 light and reflection and sensors okay so
47:06 you have all these requirements and then
47:08 you have an optimization problem yes how
47:11 do you combine your ingredients in such
47:13 a way or how you optimize your process
47:15 in such a way that you still satisfy all
47:17 the requirements and then you maybe
47:19 maximize some of the things you minimize
47:20 some of the other things this it's like
47:22 a
47:24 this is called linear programming the
47:26 Simplex method
47:27 yeah related that's what you use for
47:30 what do you typically use for I'm I'm
47:32 gonna say we're we're coming a little
47:34 too close to okay
47:38 well let's say for this
47:41 um hypothetical example of a cake what
47:43 would you use
47:45 no I'm not
47:47 Simplex methods what do you use the
47:49 Simplex method
47:51 I think honestly and I I think this is
47:54 probably I mean obvious that we have
47:56 tools that help us I mean there are
47:58 companies who specialize in doing a
48:01 mathematical optimization and making it
48:02 super easy and we might make use of
48:05 their offerings to make our lives easier
48:07 then what are we actually doing well
48:08 we're setting up the problem and if
48:11 there's not enough data there are ways
48:13 to deal with that so that's where the
48:14 data science comes in as well and then
48:17 um and then you hand all that to to a
48:20 solver okay so there is some industrial
48:24 solver there is a company who maybe
48:27 specializes at optimizing these kind of
48:30 processes right and then for you what
48:32 you need to do is Define the problem and
48:34 then put the data there and then you
48:38 know click a button and then watch this
48:39 over find the best solution I mean you
48:41 you if you only have like 10 data points
48:44 you can't feed that into a solver so
48:46 there's there's modeling in the middle
48:47 and that's where data science comes in
48:49 as well what kind of modeling is it
48:51 we're creating new data
48:55 that's the most interesting stuff I know
48:58 I know but I'm not officially here to
49:00 officially talk about this I haven't had
49:01 like a deep deep heart-to-heart
49:03 discussion with uh with Communications
49:05 about what I what I'm allowed to say so
49:07 I'm Amber recording and this is live I
49:10 have no way to like you know edit this
49:12 out later if I say something I'm not
49:14 supposed to
49:15 okay understood
49:17 um
49:19 okay I don't know I'm like I have to can
49:22 I can I answer your question at all
49:25 um I mean we do have hackers I mean we
49:27 sorry now I'm talking you know from my
49:29 company's perspective there are
49:30 hackathons that are
49:32 faced to the outside world and that's
49:35 not a bad place to learn about what kind
49:37 of modeling one does and there certainly
49:39 are I mean with tidy data the answer is
49:42 not
49:44 I mean this is obvious this is not a
49:46 secret that the ancestor is not going to
49:48 be a neural net unless it's something
49:49 that's been pre-trained and you can do
49:50 transfer learning
49:52 um so I mean I mean
49:55 make good friends with statisticians if
49:57 you think tiny data is exciting
49:59 um and I think there's no one answer and
50:01 that's what I also found quite exciting
50:02 I mean we have a working group uh at
50:04 work to talk about hey I have this
50:07 problem what do I do with it it's not
50:08 just optimization there's also can we do
50:10 prediction and sometimes the smallness
50:12 of the data is actually we have like an
50:14 uh an infrared Spectrum like some kind
50:16 of measurement that's that's like a Time
50:18 series so it looks huge but it's
50:19 actually small uh and then like how do I
50:22 take this data and figure out things
50:24 from it I mean there's a lot there's oh
50:26 I came wanting to say there's all these
50:28 cool challenges and then um well I
50:31 imagine uh like building a model a
50:34 binary classification model that take
50:36 that says with these ingredients will
50:39 and this process of baking the cake will
50:41 it crack at the end or not I don't know
50:44 you have oh that's another problem yeah
50:45 so if you don't if you don't want to do
50:47 optimization if you don't want to do
50:48 what are what's the best formulation for
50:50 this cake which is what I was working on
50:53 then and what and what you want is
50:57 um given these things what's going to
50:58 happen right will will the cake crack
51:01 completely separate question
51:03 um I mean we have those as well those
51:05 questions as well and you can also see
51:06 how like well I think
51:08 something I was sort of uh struggling to
51:10 explain to someone the other day is that
51:12 you don't with these with this kind of
51:14 work you don't necessarily have a high
51:15 volume of of in production models which
51:18 was my other like back when I hung out
51:20 in the ml Ops Community I uh was trying
51:24 to figure out you know can I use this if
51:26 this structure for my problems but if
51:29 you don't have high volume things
51:31 because you only have tiny data or you
51:33 have a Consulting project to do this one
51:34 thing
51:36 um you you don't need to you don't need
51:38 a model that's there and tells you the
51:40 optimal solution you have one
51:42 well since you mentioned the mailboxes
51:44 I'm wondering
51:46 in
51:48 industry in internet companies I know
51:51 that people use kubernetes and all this
51:52 stuff I mean Cloud
51:54 for deploying the models
51:57 I imagine that this is a pretty
51:59 different situation in uh in real
52:02 interesting if you go to the productive
52:04 side I would say if it should feel to
52:06 you like everywhere else so if you're
52:08 coming from in you know anywhere else in
52:10 industry and you're like I want to come
52:12 this industry is the sorry uh in it can
52:16 we call it it in the data space if
52:18 you're working in the data space and
52:20 you're used to how people deploy things
52:22 cict ml apps whatever and you you like
52:25 working in that space and you're looking
52:27 over here and saying manufacturing what
52:30 can I do this I would say definitely the
52:32 productive side where you're generating
52:33 I mean
52:35 right depending the speed of this
52:37 conveyor belt right and if each of our
52:39 packing peanuts has at least one I mean
52:41 it's going to have like a Time series
52:42 Associated I mean right it's giant piles
52:45 of data right at one point I was I was
52:47 so excited because I I was using spark
52:49 to Pivot like two terabytes of data and
52:53 that was like a day of data right so
52:55 there is Big Data and there are these
52:57 things where people have models and
52:58 they're doing experiments and they're
53:00 constantly deploying and all that it's
53:01 there but I would say like the the tiny
53:05 does I should feel obvious that that's
53:07 not necessarily the challenge that
53:09 you're dealing with you're dealing with
53:10 things and often it's like I mean I knew
53:11 someone who was embedding their model
53:13 into a into a a software that was being
53:16 used for visual inspections so there's
53:19 also sort of like deployment and kind of
53:20 like a local sense as well
53:22 like not a big
53:25 no understand so for the production
53:27 settings you probably have all these
53:29 kafkas and uh you know streaming date
53:32 and then
53:33 it is but yeah it doesn't matter well
53:36 what I mean is like
53:38 there are there are some systems that
53:40 are that maybe you will find in other
53:42 places like internet companies right too
53:44 because you want to react to this data
53:48 reliably right so you want to observe
53:50 this data you want to make sure like all
53:52 the alertings asset and like all the
53:55 models work real time as the process is
53:58 actually happening and then there is
54:01 other side of the Spectrum which is the
54:03 these experiments where maybe you have
54:05 like 10 data points and then you put
54:06 them in Excel and then you look at them
54:08 and then
54:09 um you don't even just look at them I
54:11 think also that's the and if you want to
54:13 if you I appreciate your summary and I
54:15 like what you're doing and they're
54:16 trying to bring us to an end but I um I
54:19 mean I think part of what's what's
54:20 really interesting is you have to also
54:24 you have to learn about the data
54:27 um and I think this is also like if
54:28 you're a scientist now and by science I
54:30 mean a real if you're if you're a
54:32 physical scientist if you're a chemist
54:34 you're you're a physicist you're I don't
54:37 know what other Sciences we have sorry
54:38 guys
54:39 um
54:41 it's a really powerful place to be
54:43 because then you could you can learn the
54:45 machine Learning lesson methods and then
54:46 you have the background right you go
54:48 into it people don't write everything
54:49 down right everybody knows when you
54:52 start making whatever it is when you
54:54 start making blue paint the first thing
54:56 you do is you heat up the container to
54:58 100 Celsius I don't know whatever but
55:00 everybody knows it so we don't write it
55:02 down so if you are a chemist who did
55:04 this thing then you know that thing
55:06 right you know all the context you know
55:08 the baked in knowledge uh and it's um so
55:12 it's more than just the Excel file I
55:13 think coming to and I've talked to
55:14 people about that and their challenges
55:15 with past projects and they're like yeah
55:17 we just threw a data scientist at it and
55:19 got nowhere as and and it's because they
55:22 didn't ask the right questions
55:24 data scientists had no idea about all
55:26 this hidden knowledge right you have to
55:28 work really closely with your partners
55:30 you can't just like you know live in a
55:33 you can't just be a Hermit data
55:34 scientist you have to be incredibly
55:35 engaged with your partners and and
55:37 interested about their processes and ask
55:39 them you cannot just open your CSV file
55:41 with fundus and then throw it to you
55:44 it's like the process is you open it you
55:46 first you talk to them and you ask them
55:48 what the problem is and that you
55:49 understand it and then they explain the
55:52 the process to you
55:55 um and what everything means and then
55:57 you go digest it and you do your Eda and
55:59 you come back and you're like
56:01 these things are both called
56:04 shininess and like shininess one
56:07 shininess too and uh their their ranges
56:11 are really different their distributions
56:13 are really different what is this what
56:14 is the shininess like what is it a data
56:17 collection problem is it like it's
56:18 impossible to like you know or is it
56:20 like a definition like do I just not
56:22 understand the difference should I be
56:23 taking the difference
56:25 um
56:25 also things like people measure stuff
56:27 like after six days after 12 days after
56:29 a month and then since they view these
56:32 as really separate measurements but to
56:33 me they're they're just the same
56:36 measurement but over time and like is it
56:38 you know in which way you should model
56:39 it like how do I cut the data how do I
56:41 model how many models do I need to bring
56:43 together to actually give what they need
56:44 there's a lot of really cool challenges
56:49 are there any open materials about the
56:52 subject I know courses books uh whatever
56:55 that people can just go and learn about
56:58 this they must be that's I should you
57:00 should
57:01 oh okay I should ask it do you know any
57:04 and can you recommend no no I mean I'm
57:07 happy I'm happy to go try to figure that
57:09 they answer that question and I wish I
57:10 wish I had gotten you an answer
57:11 beforehand
57:13 um I did put uh on this document uh
57:15 there's there's this um machine learning
57:18 repository which has uh which has a very
57:22 realistic uh data set on sensors on like
57:26 it's from the semiconductor industry uh
57:28 you can go play with that if you want to
57:29 build yourself a not only detection
57:31 model for whatever the processes that
57:32 they're modeling
57:34 um
57:36 data set right yeah I'm going to so
57:39 that's that's a short answer
57:41 but um there must be a book I just don't
57:44 know what it is uh
57:47 okay
57:48 I mean I I did a lot I
57:51 yeah
57:52 well we will release this interview in a
57:56 couple of weeks as a Audio Only version
57:58 with transcript but before then
58:02 you find anything interesting then
58:04 please let us know and we will add this
58:07 to the show notes
58:08 but by the way I just shared the link in
58:10 the live chat and I'm going to put this
58:12 in the description too to this cargo
58:15 we're at the end but there was a slido
58:17 did you check the questions do you want
58:18 to do like a quick yeah there was a
58:19 question if
58:21 um
58:22 ah there's one I don't know it's a bit
58:24 personal if you want to answer that or
58:26 not are you the only woman
58:28 um on the team
58:32 in my current team no in my larger
58:36 previous team definitely not
58:38 um I'm not gonna share a picture but we
58:40 had a we had a dinner on Friday and
58:44 um let's see there were 10 people and
58:50 for women
58:51 so gender balances
58:54 gender balance is fine I don't think
58:56 it's always it's not always half I think
58:57 some of this is of course like who
58:59 actually comes out to dinner
59:01 but um
59:03 it's not terrible
59:04 okay yeah we have more questions but I
59:07 think we already answered some of them
59:09 and for the rest like can you talk more
59:12 about uh your decision to work in
59:14 Industry it will probably require
59:16 another episode another interview
59:19 so maybe we can just
59:21 yeah I mean
59:23 why industry
59:25 I mean you have time maybe a productive
59:28 industry not like five minutes I mean
59:31 there's sort of two questions depending
59:32 on how you Define industry do we mean
59:35 um just not Academia or do we mean
59:37 productive industry
59:39 um well I guess maybe both
59:42 okay so not Academia is
59:47 uh
59:48 I like it all right here I've reached a
59:51 point where my the the next academic
59:54 petition position I could take would
59:56 have been six months for the possible
59:58 renewal for an extra six months moving
1:00:00 to another country learning another
1:00:01 language and I thought you know
1:00:03 I'm not
1:00:05 uh no
1:00:08 so at that point obviously I need to do
1:00:10 something not in Academia
1:00:13 um and then
1:00:15 why I mean why I started where I started
1:00:18 is I I asked everybody I applied for
1:00:21 everything and I asked everybody you
1:00:23 know
1:00:24 do you know people who are in Industry
1:00:27 oh yeah I know this guy oh yeah and I
1:00:29 talked to him and I mean it's over
1:00:30 someone I knew
1:00:32 um it was just something attractive to
1:00:34 you like you thought okay this is
1:00:37 something I want to work with because it
1:00:38 sounds way cooler than I don't know six
1:00:41 years ago
1:00:42 I need a job six years ago because I
1:00:45 need a job and then three years ago was
1:00:48 uh the way the project was pitched to me
1:00:50 uh was hey we're effectively like this
1:00:53 little research group in industry and we
1:00:55 have all these pocs and we want to we
1:00:57 want someone to help us try to figure
1:00:58 out how to take them turn them into
1:01:00 productive product projects and I
1:01:02 thought that sounded really cool
1:01:04 um it does and that's what got me into
1:01:06 it and then I like the people I think I
1:01:07 have to say
1:01:09 um I hung out with a lot of physicists
1:01:11 in grad school
1:01:13 um if you're listening hi
1:01:15 and I
1:01:17 um there's a lot of yeah physicists and
1:01:19 chemists just a different world view uh
1:01:21 the people that you end up interfacing
1:01:23 with in data science and as as well as
1:01:25 like the people touching the data and
1:01:27 and generating the data it's just a very
1:01:29 different flavor of workplace I mean my
1:01:32 previous employer people the people who
1:01:34 worked on the shop floor were walking
1:01:35 around in these ridiculous shiny
1:01:37 jumpsuits because it reduced the it's
1:01:40 another fabric reduces the static but so
1:01:43 you know like people just wear whatever
1:01:45 right like people show up in hiking
1:01:47 clothes like it's just this very casual
1:01:49 it's much more about you know the work
1:01:51 and the science that was very
1:01:55 yeah the people the people is the answer
1:01:57 I also
1:01:59 guess that it depends on where you are
1:02:02 geographically when it comes to Germany
1:02:04 for example if you're in Berlin there
1:02:06 are not so many
1:02:07 this kind of industry companies right so
1:02:10 you're probably
1:02:12 um you know you'll end up working from a
1:02:15 company there's like a little bit but
1:02:17 there yeah like you need to be
1:02:19 specifically looking a little further
1:02:21 away yeah not just like closer to
1:02:24 Dresden or something yeah there's a few
1:02:25 down there you have to get outside of
1:02:26 like Berlin in itself yeah
1:02:30 yeah well I think that's all we have
1:02:32 time for today thanks a lot that was a
1:02:35 really good discussion I'm very hungry
1:02:37 now after talking about peanuts and
1:02:39 cakes
1:02:41 all right
1:02:43 eat something so yeah thanks again and
1:02:46 thanks everyone for joining us today
1:02:48 um yeah it was nice talking to you yeah
1:02:51 like
1:02:53 see you soon bye
