1:07 I think we can start can we let's go
1:10 okay this week we'll talk about starting
1:13 and running a consultancy in the data
1:15 space we have a special guest today
1:17 Alexandra Alexander was a product
1:19 manager at delivery hero then he became
1:22 a co-founder and failed a few startups
1:24 and currently he is running a data
1:25 analytics agency in Berlin
1:27 he was also almost an archaeologist I'm
1:30 really curious to hear that story and we
1:32 will probably hear that a bit later
1:35 and yeah welcome to the show
1:38 hi I'm very happy to be here
1:41 so the questions for today's interview
1:43 were prepared by Johanna buyer thanks
1:45 Johanna for your help
1:47 and yeah before we start with our main
1:50 topic of
1:51 starting a data consultancy let's start
1:53 with your background can you tell us
1:55 about your career Journey so far and
1:56 please mention this archaeologist sure
1:59 absolutely I can start with that so I
2:01 mean since since I was a since I was six
2:04 years old I think and up until I was 18
2:07 like if you ask me what I'm going to be
2:08 doing in life I will tell you I'm going
2:10 to be an archaeologist I always love
2:11 history geography I was collecting like
2:14 dinosaurs and things like that
2:17 um and you know like I applied like my
2:20 entire educational path in high schools
2:22 skewed towards me going to study
2:24 archeology Etc and I applied and I got
2:26 even admit it to Unis and then that
2:29 summer I actually went and worked on the
2:32 excavation site to just get a feel of
2:35 what it means to be an archaeologist and
2:37 then long story short I um when I came
2:39 back I decided I'm going to stick to the
2:41 history books and and documentaries and
2:43 I went to study something else which was
2:46 political sciences international
2:49 business uh that's my educational
2:50 background it's pretty much everything
2:52 and nothing
2:54 um and then you know after that I
2:57 somehow managed to get into uh into a
3:00 startup e-commerce ecosystem in in
3:03 Warsaw I even co-run a startup on my own
3:06 before I moved to Berlin which is also a
3:08 story
3:10 um then
3:11 um you know I moved to Berlin in 2014
3:13 end of 2014 I moved for a job it was a
3:17 product management job at delivery hero
3:21 one of the spin-offs at the time
3:23 um this is where I met Marco who is my
3:26 business partner or a business better
3:30 half and
3:32 um we we know we built pretty cool stuff
3:34 uh during our delivery of our times
3:36 together 2019 we decided to quit to do
3:39 something on our own we went through a
3:42 few ideas for a product that was always
3:44 the the kind of main goal I wanted to
3:46 build a product company
3:48 um did a bit of Consulting in the data
3:50 space
3:51 um in between to also get a few of what
3:55 problems are there
3:57 um and then build a like our main
4:00 product that we built and try to Market
4:02 was Data stack as a service
4:04 um which is like an entire data pipeline
4:07 from the ingestion tool to actually
4:08 modeling and visualization including the
4:11 warehousing that didn't come out
4:13 um for various reasons and uh wondering
4:16 why because like seems like uh I see a
4:20 lot of startups who work in this area
4:22 and
4:23 AI
4:28 um there is there is plenty of them
4:30 what's our data there's valid
4:33 um there is there's quite a few of them
4:34 so
4:36 we did a very extensive Market
4:38 validation
4:40 um of that idea and it's
4:43 um we we believe that the market is not
4:46 there for it like or the market is very
4:48 very small
4:49 um because essentially what you're what
4:51 you're selling is
4:53 um you're selling a technology selling
4:55 technology to tech people is very
4:56 difficult because they will always think
4:58 that they can build it faster and better
4:59 themselves and even with the tooling
5:02 like you know if you look at the the
5:04 options that you have in the in the
5:06 tooling landscape today you can build a
5:08 data stack in a day or two you know and
5:10 that's gonna that's gonna do a do a
5:12 decent enough job
5:14 um can you actually build it or this is
5:16 what developers think
5:20 um I mean you Stitch you Stitch tools
5:21 together right it's like you take an
5:22 ingestion you take air bites um DBT
5:25 bigquery or snowflake or clickhouse or
5:28 whatever and then you um you do
5:31 Transformations with DBT and you plug
5:33 metabase on top and you're good to go
5:35 and the real problem starts when you
5:37 actually put data into it and you now
5:39 need to map your business into the into
5:41 the data model like that's and that's
5:43 something that is very difficult to
5:44 automate so this is probably difficult
5:47 right for a startup that provides data
5:50 stack as a service
5:52 because you only provide the stack right
5:54 and then all the business
5:57 knowledge all the business
5:58 transformation happen after that exactly
6:01 exactly so so
6:03 um you know if you're selling it to tech
6:05 people it's a very difficult sale and
6:07 then if you turn around and go to that
6:08 with the business people it's got let's
6:10 say you go to a CMO or a CFO or a CEO
6:12 and you say hey look I have this
6:14 fantastic piece of technology that now
6:15 you can use and I was like what do I do
6:17 if it's alone now you need a data
6:19 analyst to actually run this
6:20 he's like okay so now you're selling me
6:22 something that I need to not only pay
6:24 for but now you're telling me to hire
6:25 someone to do my data for me like then I
6:28 just hire the person and that person to
6:29 do that that's the data for me so what's
6:31 the point for me paying so it's
6:33 um you would need to build it in a way
6:36 that you also automate the modeling and
6:39 you know those tools also exist I think
6:41 there is CLA that automates reporting
6:44 for marketing for instance there are
6:46 certain tools that automate reporting
6:50 um for finance so basically you go
6:52 directly from the source to a report and
6:54 that's and that's value that's valuable
6:56 Tech on its own it's it's not really
6:58 valuable and mapping uh you know and the
7:01 real works it goes into the data
7:02 modeling because at the end of the day
7:04 you you just need to map the business
7:06 into into the tables and entities
7:09 is this how you ended up doing
7:11 consulting yes
7:16 um yeah so basically I mean initially we
7:18 had we had a few other ideas
7:21 um
7:22 about the product and then the first one
7:24 we also validated very quickly and it
7:27 just doesn't make any sense and and
7:29 people
7:30 who are product managers and it was was
7:32 actually the idea was inspired by my
7:35 inability to pull data from a SQL
7:37 database back in the data delivery here
7:39 and I was always Black Market to do it
7:41 for me uh we validated that this is not
7:43 something that like product managers
7:45 don't have that problem that much they
7:47 have bigger problems to solve first as a
7:50 community and then okay so you know we
7:52 already quit our job
7:54 um what can we do okay let's go to
7:56 Consulting and it's actually discover
7:57 the problems in the data space and
7:59 that's how we started and then while
8:01 doing
8:03 um certain projects we've got gigs Etc
8:04 we discovered that hey maybe we can do
8:07 the data stack as a service because we
8:09 always whenever we start a project very
8:11 often we just need to exactly and that's
8:13 repeatable repeatable work
8:16 um so that's how it that's how it
8:18 started and then we we try we actually
8:20 found the first customer but very very
8:22 quickly uh from the beginning of like uh
8:25 you know we started searching for the
8:27 first customer it took us two weeks to
8:29 land one and we had zero product uh we
8:31 had nothing so we basically we sold an
8:34 idea
8:35 um that we're gonna solve that problem
8:37 because the data stack uh idea or the
8:40 second one the data stack idea
8:43 yeah
8:45 um we solved it without having a product
8:46 and that actually led us to a to a bit
8:49 of a wrong path going forward
8:51 um without getting too many results yeah
8:54 so when we when we decided to stop doing
8:55 now and we did like a really extensive
8:58 Market validation whether we can sell
8:59 this whether the market actually exists
9:02 um we decided to go to go back to
9:04 Consulting and and fully focus on that
9:06 from from then on
9:08 and wondering how did it happen that you
9:11 managed to sell something to sell an
9:13 idea without having an actual
9:15 implementation was it like a part of
9:17 your user research you were reaching out
9:19 to companies to understand what their
9:20 problems are and they are like okay yeah
9:23 we have this problem solve it for us
9:26 so so basically like you know and I
9:30 think this advice
9:31 um this advice is applicable to to any
9:34 kind of business startup service that
9:37 you want to provide like any anything
9:38 like that
9:40 whatever you do you you really need to
9:43 um first see whether the problem that
9:46 you're trying to solve exists and
9:48 whether there is enough people to
9:50 um to pay for it
9:53 um and so what we what we did is
9:57 um I I actually I need to I need to get
9:59 royalties for that because I go around
10:00 and I talk about this book A Lot the
10:02 book is called the mom test right and
10:05 um what what that book allows you to do
10:07 is it allows you to validate your
10:10 business idea
10:12 um without having anything just by
10:13 talking to people and the trick is that
10:15 you don't you never tell them what
10:17 you're doing
10:18 because the moment you um tell people
10:21 what your idea is they will lie to you
10:23 because they want to be nice to you and
10:25 because they know your ego is on the
10:26 line and it it's it gives very very
10:29 practical advice on how to talk to
10:31 people and how to extract information
10:33 that you get very valuable feedback and
10:36 you know you do 10 15 conversations like
10:38 that that tells you a lot
10:40 um and you didn't have to write a single
10:42 line of code so we were trying to do Mom
10:45 tests so we were you know putting
10:47 messages in
10:51 or different job boards Etc I will try
10:54 or picking people directly we're just
10:56 trying to talk to people about the
10:59 problem of like is not having a
11:01 technology that can process your data is
11:04 that a problem that hinders you from
11:06 actually doing
11:07 um doing useful stuff with it and um and
11:11 we offered free Consulting for their uh
11:13 for the time so like you talk to us and
11:15 then we'll offer you free Consulting and
11:16 in return
11:17 so that that time is also worthwhile for
11:20 you
11:20 and uh we managed to find the person
11:23 that's that that was our first customer
11:26 um we talked to to them they explained
11:29 it was a CTO of uh of a company they're
11:32 still our customers because the product
11:33 that we put still runs and our customers
11:36 still is paying for it
11:38 um and yeah you know the conversation he
11:42 simply asked us like okay like so we
11:44 told you about our problems like really
11:46 this is a problem for us
11:48 what are you trying to do what's in it
11:50 what's in it for you and you just
11:51 explained the idea that we had and he
11:53 basically said you know what like make
11:55 an offer you can you can build it for us
11:57 and we'll see our first customer
11:59 it's amazing that's that's that's how we
12:01 that's how we solved the first copy of
12:04 something that does not exist yet
12:06 so you said so there is a book called
12:08 Mom test the book describes how to
12:10 extract information from people from
12:13 this user interviews to really
12:15 understand if your problem uh the
12:18 problem you're trying to solve if it
12:19 exists and if people want to pay for
12:22 solving this problem right so you try to
12:24 do this pump test you reach out to
12:26 different people
12:27 and some of them were quite interested
12:29 in
12:30 yeah I mean in general people people
12:33 will talk to you like if people are
12:36 generally they're willing to help if
12:37 they know that they're not trying to
12:39 sell them something and they'll be very
12:40 keen like because people love to talk
12:42 about themselves it's um it's just in
12:44 human nature and so if you just know how
12:47 to nudge and still the conversation in
12:49 the right direction you can learn like
12:51 really a lot
12:53 maybe maybe give us an example or like
12:56 how exactly does it work like let's say
12:58 you want to uh build a startup that
13:02 sells data stack as a service right so
13:04 how do you approach this user interviews
13:07 you you usually ask them about
13:10 um you need that you need a general like
13:13 fairly General leading question at the
13:15 beginning
13:16 um like for instance like you know if
13:17 you're talking to a data analyst because
13:19 our our initial Target was Data analysts
13:24 and we knew that data analysts at the
13:27 time they don't really have enough you
13:29 know very often they don't really have
13:30 enough technical skills to put together
13:31 a stack like that and
13:34 um all the like they keep extracting you
13:36 know they they download the CSV from
13:39 Salesforce uh they have some Google
13:40 Sheets
13:42 um they copy and paste there's a lot of
13:44 manual work um so it's you know Pro to
13:46 errors Etc and they try to Stitch things
13:48 together and do another system of that
13:50 if they would have a central place where
13:52 all those sources are in which is you
13:54 know today is the standard that's called
13:56 the modern data stack
13:58 um
13:59 you can then run your SQL and you can
14:01 you can you can build this organization
14:02 you can serve uh you can help the help
14:04 the business to answer business question
14:07 um so you know we would ask them hey
14:09 what do you do all day where does your
14:11 time go you know and then and then you
14:13 start with that and you listen and tune
14:18 in for for uh little nuggets of like oh
14:21 maybe they have a problem here and then
14:23 you dig deeper into that and you never
14:25 ask questions like oh would you buy this
14:27 would you pay for this x
14:30 um would you I don't know if because if
14:32 you ask someone a very hypothetical
14:33 questions like yeah if you're giving
14:34 this amazing piece of technology I'll
14:36 take it right like oh it's it's you know
14:39 is this a problem too it's like yes it's
14:41 a problem
14:43 um that's that's not useful information
14:45 because people also like to complain if
14:48 if actually they tell you it's a problem
14:50 you still need to gauge whether
14:53 um whether it's like how big is that
14:54 problem so you ask them you know when
14:56 was the last time it happened
14:59 um if you don't solve it what are the
15:01 consequences you know is it just a mere
15:03 inconvenience because sometimes it's
15:05 like oh okay whatever I copy and paste
15:07 this thing you know but if you if if you
15:10 if if they tell you like
15:12 um you know if I don't solve this then
15:14 potentially we're risking losing Revenue
15:16 so well that's a big problem right and
15:18 then you're trying to figure out how
15:19 frequent the problem is is this
15:21 something that happens every day is it
15:23 something that happened it's painful but
15:24 happens to them once uh every six months
15:27 then yeah maybe it's not big enough you
15:29 know
15:30 um it's uh it's it's you're trying to
15:32 extract very very concrete examples of
15:34 their workflow where they suffer
15:37 um and what what the actual suffering
15:39 that what the pain is
15:42 like how do you record them so I guess
15:45 during the interview you record the
15:48 conversation right and then you somehow
15:50 capture this in a bunch of Google
15:53 Documents or something like that right
15:55 this yeah yeah this I mean this this
15:57 discount these conversations are usually
15:58 you have the
16:00 um I mean we we didn't record them so we
16:02 would take notes we would basically
16:04 um the
16:06 um whenever we could it would be the two
16:08 of us doing that call it's actually very
16:10 beneficial and to do it in pairs
16:14 um you don't want you don't want to more
16:16 than two people because now if if it's
16:19 just one person or you're interviewing
16:20 there are three people
16:22 um on the call or in a room it's it
16:24 might feel a bit overwhelming and
16:26 stressful
16:28 um so people don't don't won't open up
16:30 that much but like if two people is fine
16:32 so one person is responsible for
16:36 um asking the questions and and nudging
16:39 in the right direction and the other
16:40 person's responsible for taking the
16:41 notes and this way and then the other
16:44 person also needs to
16:46 um
16:47 be the the kind of the guardian of the
16:50 conversation in a way that whoever has
16:52 the it's very easy to start the pitch
16:54 especially when you already have
16:56 something
16:57 um and you never want to pitch them
16:59 because the moment you reveal what
17:00 you're doing again you're gonna start
17:02 lying to you
17:04 um I mean some people are direct some
17:06 people will tell you that you know well
17:07 your brother doesn't it's stupid doesn't
17:09 make any sense
17:10 um
17:11 but most don't
17:13 um exactly and you know you can't
17:16 um you can't have 1 000 conversations to
17:18 help that you're gonna you know lag 10
17:20 people that are super honest with you
17:23 um so you want to avoid the pitching as
17:24 much as possible and and basically the
17:27 other job the other person's job is to
17:29 also
17:30 um make sure that whoever is asking
17:32 questions don't get too excited and jump
17:34 ahead
17:35 um with pitching too early
17:38 so your background is in product
17:40 management I mean archaeologist site uh
17:42 what is uh the background of Marco is
17:46 Hills Marco Marco no Marco is a software
17:48 engineer software engineer okay so who
17:51 was uh I guess it was two of you you and
17:53 Marco who were doing the interviews
17:56 um so how did you split this
17:57 responsibilities who was taking notes
17:59 who was asking questions this depends
18:01 [Music]
18:03 right yes
18:05 see interesting
18:07 uh yeah and so I did this 10 15
18:11 conversations right following the map
18:13 test and then at the end you found out
18:16 that there is no like the problem is not
18:18 big enough it's not really that yeah so
18:19 we first we saw we first thought the
18:21 mistake that we the mistake that we did
18:24 um was we sold it without having it
18:27 which is an ideal scenario like if
18:29 someone is if if someone is taking out
18:32 their credit card and telling you yeah
18:34 I'm gonna buy this without you having
18:37 anything at all uh that's a great signal
18:40 you just need to have enough people that
18:43 will do that so we got excited we went
18:45 and built it uh we launched it we you
18:48 know we um we did everything
18:50 Etc we we we helped
18:53 um with setting it up with the models
18:56 and with setting up the metabase and and
18:58 [Music]
18:59 um
19:00 and transferring some of these they
19:02 already had metabase so we transferred
19:04 some of the reports into the onto the
19:06 modeling layer that they were faster
19:07 they actually run
19:09 um
19:10 and it's like well if we can find a
19:12 customer in two weeks without having it
19:14 like that wow we should just like go out
19:17 and spam everyone like this is sitting
19:19 on the gold mine right what was it the
19:22 case no it wasn't so we we spent good
19:25 few months trying to acquire
19:27 um the next customers and they and it
19:30 never happened
19:31 um and that's when we were like hang on
19:33 like maybe we're just like we were
19:35 trying to run before we could walk let's
19:37 go back to validate
19:39 um and we went back to validating we
19:42 managed to line up I think 15 people
19:45 um that could be potential customers and
19:47 then after talking to them doing the
19:49 proper mountains Etc it was it became
19:52 kind of obvious that
19:54 um it's it's just it's it's just not
19:56 that like I mean there are it's this
19:59 product makes sense right like it it
20:00 makes sense there are companies who use
20:03 it
20:04 um and
20:07 it's just I don't think there's enough
20:09 people
20:10 um that enough companies that where it
20:12 makes sense or that the life cycle is
20:14 long enough because
20:16 you know you sacrifice a certain degree
20:18 of flexibility
20:19 with products like that it's a black box
20:21 you don't know what it is and and you
20:24 either can build it in an opinionated
20:26 way or you build it in an open way but
20:28 in an open way I mean then it's you know
20:31 it's it's either open source or um there
20:33 are different uh different pieces of it
20:35 like you know ingestion transformation
20:38 Etc
20:39 um and you can't really like doing a
20:41 compromises is very difficult you can't
20:43 have it you know inflexible but yet
20:46 allow for certain changes like that's
20:48 that's just very technically challenging
20:50 to to actually build uh so you need to
20:52 pick and if you're picking it as uh you
20:55 know you can it's this is what it is
20:57 this is a black one this is you don't
20:58 really never know how it works
21:01 it's um yeah people like people don't
21:03 like that we talked to some of the
21:06 customers of our company on our
21:08 competitors and
21:11 um you know there is something to be
21:13 said that if your team is a little bit
21:15 more Junior
21:16 then this provides certain guide rails
21:18 and they cannot mess up too much I mean
21:21 they still can mess up models right
21:23 um but you can mess up models always and
21:27 so that like having that kind of a rigid
21:29 structure
21:30 um you know
21:32 can can basically make up for certain
21:35 mistakes that less experienced people do
21:38 while working on the Pipelines
21:40 these clients of yours that you landed
21:42 during conducting this bomb test so they
21:46 were interested in the product that you
21:48 want to build but at the end you and you
21:50 kind of ended up Consulting them right
21:52 so you said that let's build these
21:55 things for you exactly exactly because
21:57 what they really wanted and what the
22:00 real benefit was it was the free
22:02 Consulting that they got out of it
22:05 um
22:06 when when actually we're building it and
22:09 because we we built their models we went
22:13 and built their modeling layer in our
22:15 tool obviously but like we we wrote the
22:17 sequel
22:19 um and that's the real value we went and
22:21 we understood their business and tries
22:22 to translated it into SQL models and
22:25 that was the real value not the shell
22:27 that would run it right
22:29 um so
22:30 um and and it took us a while to realize
22:32 that actually because you know you're
22:34 excited that someone is actually willing
22:36 to pay you for the product that you
22:37 built and that's um that can lead to the
22:40 wrong path
22:42 so how did you realize that building
22:44 these models is what you want to do and
22:46 you and Marco started this consultancy
22:49 company
22:50 um this is it's it's it's it's where the
22:53 value is it's it's when you're working
22:55 with you know data is is is to us
22:59 um
23:00 bridging a gap between the business and
23:03 and and you know whatever is hidden in
23:06 um in the data that you collect
23:09 um and it's first and foremost you start
23:12 with that there is someone has a
23:14 business question they need to take a
23:15 decision
23:16 um you start with that you spend time
23:18 understanding what it is
23:20 and it's a lot of you know talking to
23:23 your stakeholders it's there is a lot of
23:24 product work there like you know when
23:27 you when you when like I I always keep
23:29 saying that there is so much overlap
23:31 between the product uh managers jobs and
23:34 data and his job because data teams
23:36 don't have product managers usually you
23:38 know some bigger ones and bigger
23:40 companies of course yes
23:42 um but most of the teams don't have that
23:44 luxury so someone needs to go and do
23:46 that work
23:48 so to really uncover because at the end
23:50 of the day like data teams they you know
23:51 it's an internal product if you're
23:53 talking like be a business intelligence
23:55 Etc it's an it's an internal product um
23:57 you're serving your internal customers
24:00 they work on other teams
24:02 um
24:03 and this is where the value is and this
24:05 is what's difficult once you know
24:08 more or less what needs to happen
24:12 I mean you know
24:15 there is a lot of talking we have chat
24:17 GPT now there's you know a lot of talk
24:18 about data science Etc like a lot of
24:20 companies
24:22 can can do without it a lot of companies
24:24 don't have the data it's like they they
24:26 need they need
24:27 um you know helping basic things and the
24:30 the basic things take them eighty
24:32 percent of the way and once you you know
24:34 once you get that 80 of the way then you
24:37 can start thinking okay how do I
24:39 optimize the next two percent the next
24:41 three percent the next and this is where
24:42 this is where machine learning this is
24:44 where data science is really common to
24:46 play and really you can can be that
24:48 valuable
24:50 um but at the beginning and we're
24:52 talking you know we're talking here like
24:54 medium-sized companies we're talking
24:56 startups postseed pre-series a series a
25:00 that kind of level unless unless your
25:02 product like unless your value
25:05 proposition
25:06 requires AI right like and and requires
25:09 machine learning that's that's a
25:10 different story
25:12 um then you really need to invest from
25:14 the get-go because otherwise you don't
25:15 have a value proposition but when we're
25:18 talking about you know analyzing the
25:20 business understanding what how the
25:22 business is doing
25:24 um predicting how the business can be
25:25 doing there is there's a lot of very
25:28 simple and pragmatic and very often
25:30 boring things
25:32 um that you can do that do not require
25:35 um don't require a lot of effort but to
25:38 you know dig this out you really need to
25:40 understand what is needed and that's a
25:43 difficult part
25:44 I want to ask you about this simple
25:46 pragmatic and boring things but maybe
25:50 before that uh yeah
25:55 I'm curious so why is this called
25:57 Consulting like do you just uh
26:01 go there ask questions or you no no
26:04 we're handsome
26:06 we are Hands-On we are um we are
26:09 implementing things so I mean you know
26:12 Consulting can have a very very negative
26:14 connotation right like let's be let's be
26:16 upfront about like you know you pay you
26:17 pay Consultants they they come in they
26:19 tell you what to do and they um they
26:21 they go away and watch they give you
26:23 their invoice and wash their hands of
26:26 the um
26:28 um of the consequences or the results so
26:32 um you know we know we Implement things
26:34 we basically go in and then we try to
26:36 figure out what's needed and and then we
26:38 will Implement those things and then we
26:40 take full accountability if it works or
26:41 not
26:42 um obviously so I mean in a nutshell
26:45 where is it called Consulting because to
26:46 me Consulting is actually
26:49 um a company has a question and then
26:51 they need to consult somebody on solving
26:53 the questions so they consult they get
26:55 input and then they go implement it I
26:57 guess this is like a classical no this
26:59 is this is a good question this is
27:03 that's that's what it means you consult
27:04 someone if you if you have a problem
27:06 right and
27:08 then but we're talking here also about
27:11 implementing things
27:13 um I don't know
27:14 um
27:15 it's called Consulting too right so and
27:17 this is the case yeah it's just a kind
27:20 of it's it's uh yeah it's just a sub
27:22 group of Consulting type of Consulting
27:25 um probably
27:27 um but yeah very often I laugh that you
27:29 know you're being paid to
27:32 um you're being paid to to kind of come
27:34 in and advise and then Implement what
27:38 people need but very often you end up
27:40 just implementing what people want
27:43 because there is a there is a there is a
27:46 limited uh there is a limited amount of
27:48 influence you can actually have and
27:50 exerting influence sometimes it's just
27:52 uh you know just difficult it really
27:55 depends on the client Okay so
27:59 first let me ask you about how you find
28:02 these clients so you said that your
28:04 clients are usually uh startups like
28:07 pre-seize startups or I don't know
28:08 seriously startups that do not
28:10 necessarily have uh do not have this
28:13 data infrastructure so they in order to
28:15 do cool things in the future they need
28:18 to get the basics first right so how do
28:21 you find these companies where do you
28:22 find them do you open uh I don't know uh
28:26 because it's called
28:28 like there are websites where you see
28:30 the client the crunch right or something
28:32 like that where you can yeah no so it's
28:35 uh it's it's it's it's a little bit
28:38 different I mean you know consulting or
28:40 freelancing or you know basically like
28:43 contractual based workers like at the
28:46 end of the day we're external Partners
28:47 or external providers external
28:50 contractors
28:51 um
28:52 it's a very much network based business
28:58 but it's not like you cannot just like
29:01 wait until your network gives you gigs
29:04 um you you meet so you need to help it a
29:06 little bit right so
29:09 um getting the first projects is is
29:11 usually the it's it's the most difficult
29:14 or whatever it wasn't that difficult
29:17 right I mean we got it we got it we got
29:19 when we switched to Consulting when we
29:22 switch to Consulting
29:23 um you know it's it's a little bit
29:25 different and we would tell people like
29:27 hey you're doing consulting now like do
29:29 you reach out to your network first
29:30 that's what you do this is the first
29:31 step you basically you let people who
29:33 you think can introduce you to
29:37 um to potential clients or who can have
29:40 work for you because you know
29:42 you've built up from that more than
29:43 people go work for different companies
29:45 maybe they maybe they need help as well
29:47 so you so you do that first and you let
29:49 people know
29:52 um that you you are looking right and
29:54 you let them you let them know you need
29:56 to be you need to think about like okay
29:58 what is my positioning who is actually
29:59 my Target customer
30:01 um because then if if you need to
30:04 explain to others what you're doing even
30:05 if it's even if it's just Consulting
30:08 like okay it can have many shapes and
30:10 forms so you need to think about that
30:12 let me reach out to them
30:13 um so that's that's step number one uh
30:16 but again
30:17 like uh because it sounds easy right so
30:21 you just okay who is my target audience
30:24 how their position also uh how do you
30:27 position ourselves it looks simple but
30:30 when you actually start it's not easy
30:31 it's not easy right so we we struggle up
30:37 until today we we basically we
30:38 experiment uh we see what lands we see
30:41 what message what kind of what what
30:43 strikes the chord on the other side
30:45 right so I mean you always start with
30:48 like okay who do I want to who do I want
30:49 to work with
30:51 um and we are we are even now
30:53 experimenting with the uh with how we
30:55 position ourselves so for instance you
30:57 know we back in like when we were
30:59 starting like oh we were the guys who
31:01 will come in and we'll Build Your First
31:02 Data Warehouse WordPress reports models
31:05 Etc like that's what we would what we
31:07 were doing
31:08 um and we had like we knew when what is
31:11 the moment in the life of the company
31:13 that actually
31:15 that this this becomes helpful and it
31:17 actually makes sense because you
31:19 shouldn't build your data warehouse too
31:21 fast right like it's it's there is a
31:23 there is a point in time that that makes
31:25 sense and and and it's at the beginning
31:28 of the company like it's just it just
31:29 simply doesn't
31:31 um and so we knew which kind of
31:33 companies we should go for and these
31:35 were the you know kind of see around
31:38 series a startups
31:40 um because this is you know if we're
31:42 doing things right this is where you're
31:44 hitting your product Market fit so this
31:46 is where you're going to start scaling
31:47 and that's something that is very useful
31:49 when you more or less already know what
31:51 you're doing and you just need to do
31:52 more of it you go you're you're getting
31:54 out of the experimentation base
31:56 [Music]
31:58 did you have any like geographical
32:00 restrictions that you focus on those
32:02 companies in Berlin or you just targeted
32:04 everyone
32:07 um as long as we're in the more or less
32:09 in the same time zone like working with
32:10 uh with companies in in California would
32:13 have been difficult also we don't have a
32:15 footprint that we don't have Network and
32:16 our competition is always local so it's
32:19 you can't go Global but it's you know
32:21 when you want to grow to a certain size
32:23 and you probably make sense to expand
32:26 um so you know we would talk to VCS we
32:29 we know if you we know a few BCS Etc so
32:31 hey there's anyone from your portfolio
32:33 companies do they need help
32:35 um it's very it's all you know you you
32:38 you think about which which are the
32:40 people that you know can help you to
32:42 learn the clients
32:43 um
32:44 and you just need to like when it comes
32:47 to I just want to go back to positioning
32:48 because that was your question
32:50 um
32:51 you need to think about yeah who is your
32:53 customer and then what what is the what
32:55 is the value proposition what are you
32:57 offering then right even in data
32:59 Fielding it can be so many things so you
33:03 can decide to like so now we're trying
33:05 to say you know we are on-demand data
33:08 analysts right
33:09 um and we work directly with the
33:10 business
33:12 um and we can help you optimize our
33:14 Revenue we can help you optimize your
33:17 marketing spend we can
33:20 um no maybe there is some kind of risk
33:23 that you're having in the company and
33:25 and you want to you want to Nuke that
33:27 risk maybe there is um
33:30 maybe you want to know who your
33:31 customers are maybe you want to do some
33:33 kind of segmentation we start with a
33:35 with a business opportunity or a
33:37 business problem
33:39 um and you know yes we can build the
33:40 infrastructure you know we have full
33:42 stack capabilities
33:44 um but because we have like between the
33:46 two of us we we have the it's a blessing
33:49 and a curse because we can literally do
33:50 anything
33:51 um we have that we start from you know
33:53 we have product skills uh the both of us
33:56 like have data analytics skills and then
33:58 Marco has the engineering skills
34:01 um so so we can we can really do a lot
34:04 um but you can't just tell people oh I'm
34:06 doing everything it's okay like you're
34:07 probably doing nothing
34:09 um so you need to you need to think
34:12 about what you want to offer you can you
34:13 can you can say like you know what I'm I
34:15 am a data scientist or I'm a data
34:17 engineer
34:18 I'm gonna partner up with someone and
34:20 we're just gonna hit up the companies
34:22 that already have big teams and they
34:24 just need the Hands-On support on
34:26 certain projects you can do that that's
34:28 a position right and it just it just
34:30 comes down to what you can do what you
34:33 can do well and who you can help
34:35 and it's it's difficult
34:39 and then you have to choose the right
34:40 words
34:41 so first you think what do I want to do
34:43 like if I'm a data scientist I want to
34:46 help companies who already have a data
34:48 science team but maybe they are they are
34:51 short on people right so then I can go
34:54 there and help with the existing
34:55 projects or I can Target companies who
34:58 uh do not have any data infrastructure
35:00 but they want to do some data stuff in
35:02 the future
35:04 um so first thing you need to Define
35:06 like with your Target customer right and
35:08 then once you define it you need to come
35:10 to them and say why they should hire you
35:13 right so why they should get you so in
35:15 your case it was
35:17 they probably have some business uh well
35:21 how to say problems or things they want
35:23 to solve like who are our customers so
35:26 and then like you you know you said like
35:28 maybe they need segmentation or
35:31 optimized markets uh spending on Market
35:33 marketing right so I guess in this case
35:37 you need to know the domain in which
35:39 they work a little bit so then you can
35:40 speak the same language to them you can
35:42 already suggest some things so then this
35:45 is your messaging right so this is like
35:47 you have a Target
35:49 customer you already have some problems
35:52 in mind that you can solve for them and
35:54 this is what you pitch right and then if
35:58 they like they hire you if they don't
36:01 you keep it rating on your messaging
36:03 right
36:03 well yes I mean you essentially
36:06 um you know you can keep iterating on
36:08 your messaging
36:09 you can keep iterating on also on your
36:14 on your positioning right and it's like
36:16 what what is your value proposition like
36:17 you can you can you can test if you can
36:19 do more like in these two things the
36:22 first is Target uh customer and then
36:24 this think that you can solve them so
36:27 positioning is related to the first one
36:30 or the second or to both both it's
36:33 really it's related to both it's uh it's
36:35 kind of yeah it's in yeah it relates to
36:38 both you need to know like it includes
36:40 who is your
36:42 um who is your customer and what is your
36:44 offering offering
36:45 um and then because from that you can
36:47 figure out okay where do these people
36:49 hang out where do I find them
36:52 um you know who do I know I've been
36:54 introducing those people how do I want
36:56 to structure my messaging around that
36:58 that's you know part of the part of the
36:59 positioning as well
37:02 can you give an example of this
37:04 messaging
37:07 um maybe this is what you do to your
37:09 customers this is what you suggest to
37:10 your customers right now maybe you can
37:12 do them like yeah exactly so so for
37:14 instance you know like okay let's say
37:15 we're on demand data analyst right so
37:18 okay it's still very broad like that
37:20 analyst can do a lot of things so what
37:22 can you help me with specifically so if
37:24 if we if we're if we're talking to I
37:26 don't know a if you're looking to a CFO
37:29 you can say like look we can help you
37:31 optimize your Revenue right like you're
37:33 this is these are the tight times
37:34 everyone is uh especially if we're
37:37 talking about PC BC back and startups
37:41 um investors are looking at their pmls
37:43 with more scrutiny right now okay let's
37:45 let's let us let us help you find
37:48 um opportunities to to you know to
37:50 either reduce your spend or
37:53 um to increase your Revenue if uh if you
37:56 need to optimize how much you're
37:57 spending on marketing Let's help you
37:59 with that
38:00 um you know we can we can figure your
38:02 tracking we can we can try to optimize
38:06 um you know where you're where your
38:08 marketing spend should be going like how
38:10 do you calculate your return investment
38:12 Etc maybe you can do something wrong
38:13 attribution
38:15 um you it really depends on on on who
38:18 you're talking about
38:19 the problems that they have I guess you
38:22 need to do a bit of homework right so
38:24 before you stick with a customer you
38:26 want to understand okay there in this
38:28 particular Market segment probably they
38:31 have this this and these problems and
38:33 then you go to a meeting with them and
38:34 you say that this is what we can help
38:36 with and you start talking and then
38:37 while talking to your list that maybe
38:39 the problem is not what you want to
38:41 suggest but something related right and
38:44 then while talking you figure this out
38:46 right yeah and then you know it's going
38:48 back to going back to to how you acquire
38:52 the customer so like you know because
38:53 that is relevant like how again the
38:56 positioning Etc so we right now we're
38:58 testing a few things because
39:00 last year was fantastic right last year
39:03 we were turning we were rejecting
39:04 project because we just did not have
39:06 capacity and
39:08 um last year was still a year where
39:10 there was a lot of
39:12 um VC money
39:14 um and you know people people were still
39:17 higher end of the year we we saw
39:21 um like a lot of layoffs in various
39:22 companies right and because of that and
39:26 that would that would also include
39:28 people in the data in the data industry
39:30 so because of that there is there was
39:32 influx of of people into the market and
39:35 you know
39:36 yes there were layoffs but there are
39:39 still a lot of companies that are hiring
39:41 like you can still find a job like
39:43 there's the competition on the market
39:44 became uh bigger when you were when you
39:48 were a job Seeker but there are still
39:50 companies that are hiring and uh those
39:52 companies
39:54 um who have the budgets and who have
39:55 problems uh were solving six months ago
39:58 could not hire
39:59 and this is where you actually a
40:03 external contractor is becoming very
40:05 attractive to you because uh you can
40:08 have that person tomorrow
40:11 um and you know trying to poach at such
40:13 a little just and not enough supply for
40:15 the demands right now the demand is much
40:18 uh like it's much smaller and Supply
40:20 increased therefore uh you know the
40:23 companies who are cutting budgets
40:24 obviously like they're cutting like
40:26 maybe taking contractors doesn't make
40:29 much sense however it might in some
40:31 cases actually
40:33 um and then people who still have the
40:35 you know certain needs to be fulfilled
40:37 they can just hire easily now and
40:38 probably cheaper because the salaries
40:40 are also inflated
40:42 um and and now we're probably gonna see
40:45 um a decrease in in the size the market
40:47 is Shifting towards the employer market
40:49 and event is there still room for
40:52 Consulting right now in this market
40:55 I think it's tougher yes so you know one
40:58 of the one of the cons is of doing this
41:01 is that there's uncertainty yesterday
41:03 today you have projects tomorrow you
41:05 might not have and uh essentially it is
41:08 up to you to to
41:10 um to find work but um yeah like this I
41:13 I believe that's it's still possible
41:14 like we we do have a little bit of work
41:16 we uh we really have been we're talking
41:18 to people we're having leads
41:20 um so so that's there's definitely the
41:23 you know
41:25 it's still people still need support and
41:28 uh and but this is where the you know
41:29 how you position yourself
41:31 Etc this is where it becomes crucial
41:33 because so you know you rely on certain
41:36 on certain distribution channels it's
41:38 called them that
41:39 um and it's not that they are super
41:41 repeatables like you're just like I'm
41:42 gonna spend money here and I know I'm
41:44 going to get clients it doesn't work
41:45 like I mean you can do it without one
41:47 sales but if you're small that might not
41:49 necessarily make a lot of sense so yes
41:51 network but then it's it's you know you
41:53 you message people you talk to them you
41:54 wait
41:55 um we do contents we we try to do
41:58 LinkedIn Works actually it's it's very
42:00 interesting like you know if you put
42:02 constant
42:03 um if you put yourself out there with a
42:05 very constant messaging that relates
42:07 with your target audience
42:09 we've seen people are actually reaching
42:11 out to you
42:13 um to solve their problems so that's why
42:15 it's important to play around with the
42:16 message and then build the build the the
42:19 content that you produce around that uh
42:25 exactly the same thing and by the way if
42:28 you're listening to us right now hi
42:31 thanks for putting us together so I
42:34 think yeah she mentioned that I mean we
42:35 we know we know this problem we know
42:37 this from her we collaborate on a few
42:39 things so
42:40 um so that's so that's why the messaging
42:42 is important uh you know content in
42:45 general is is it works and we also we
42:48 had people getting in touch with us in
42:51 the past
42:52 because someone saw a blog post that we
42:55 wrote and then someone asked that person
42:58 if they know anyone's ago I actually got
42:59 that blog post you know what
43:01 um go talk to these guys uh maybe they
43:03 can help you it's just building this up
43:05 takes time and but in the long run it
43:08 pays off
43:09 um so
43:11 you you do those things you you do all
43:13 of them and
43:15 um it all compounds and then that's how
43:18 you build this table
43:19 um stable engine to be able to talk to
43:21 people so you need to network and then
43:23 network uh you get referrals right so
43:27 the happy clients refer other clients
43:29 but you also need other sources of leads
43:33 right and then absolutely one of the
43:35 sources uh is content and content could
43:38 be you mentioned LinkedIn posts post
43:42 um
43:43 messages targeted at your
43:45 ideal customers at your Target customers
43:48 and then you also write blog posts that
43:50 are also targeted at these customers
43:53 by the way so do you do this post
43:56 yourselves or you have some sort of
43:58 content manager how do you do this no we
44:00 at the moment we do them ourselves
44:03 um when we when we started
44:06 um when we started writing blog posts we
44:08 worked with
44:10 um with an editor the freelance editor
44:13 who would help us because you know
44:14 writing is difficult like it's a skill
44:16 on its own okay yes for you for product
44:18 manager it's easier because you need to
44:21 you know of course software Engineers is
44:23 probably harder than
44:25 um it's a it's a skill it's if you're
44:27 not physically on the regular it's if
44:28 you're not doing it on a regular basis
44:30 it's uh it's it's it has roles that you
44:32 need to you know there's a lot of things
44:34 to consider so we work with someone that
44:35 would you know help us structure the
44:37 Articles better like read through them
44:38 proofread them uh point out mistakes Etc
44:43 um we so so that helps because then you
44:46 learn from that person as well do you
44:47 get tips you talk to that person like
44:49 hey maybe you should structure in a
44:50 different way and the the person that
44:52 you work with don't need doesn't need to
44:54 know anything about what you're doing
44:56 you need to explain Etc
44:59 um and then but we still like we up up
45:01 into today we still write
45:03 um write our own content I I I like
45:05 writing my own content you know because
45:07 it allows me to also Express who I am
45:11 um it's it's mine
45:13 um so it's it's kind of important to me
45:15 that I I write that
45:18 and then there is a question that has
45:20 been there for quite some time and I
45:22 think now it's time we covered that so
45:24 the question is how did you decide on
45:26 pricing for your first client
45:32 um
45:35 okay we're gonna go with that
45:37 um I mean for those who listen to this
45:41 without the video so what did you just
45:43 do it's it's it's it was a more or less
45:46 random number I mean sorry it wasn't
45:49 random it was it was a number it was not
45:51 random so we looked at what competitors
45:54 are charging
45:55 um and then you the way you need to
45:57 think about this is
46:00 you want this to be you you want to base
46:03 your pricing based off value you don't
46:06 base a pricing of something based on
46:08 what it costs you to produce it that's
46:10 that's the first thing
46:12 like like if you're trying to design a
46:15 product or a service that's the first
46:16 thing you need to understand the service
46:17 does not cost how much it is you know
46:21 the service does not cost the client or
46:23 customer and so the price based on the
46:25 manufacturing costs
46:28 um it's based on the value that whatever
46:30 you're doing is providing right it can
46:32 be so you know we're thinking our
46:35 thinking was more or less along those
46:38 lines right so we
46:40 we try to enable
46:42 a data analyst and at the time hiring
46:47 data Engineers was extremely difficult
46:49 because these are the times that
46:50 everyone the attention was so hot
46:52 everyone wanted to hire one I even did
46:54 like benchmarking and then I did some
46:56 LinkedIn searches to just quantify how
47:00 many jobs are out there versus how many
47:02 people with the the title and the Gap
47:05 was massive like in Europe it was 100
47:06 and the status was like 200 so even in
47:09 the in the US even if everyone quit or
47:12 was fired or was poached and switched
47:14 jobs the guy could still exist which is
47:16 ridiculous
47:17 [Music]
47:18 um
47:18 so data engineer cost X I'm saving you
47:21 the you know the full-time
47:23 um higher so the service obviously it's
47:26 you know it needs to be cheaper than a
47:28 full-time higher
47:30 um like that's that's that's that's the
47:32 rule of the thumb paper in which sense
47:34 because
47:35 um I guess for you as a consultant you
47:38 need to charge a bit more than let's say
47:42 a month sorry I was referring if you're
47:44 selling a product
47:45 right so um
47:58 getting the pricing right is is not that
48:01 crucial at the beginning is more
48:03 importantly like you know if whatever
48:06 I'm selling sells and people are willing
48:09 to pay for it and then you will have to
48:10 change your pricing on the way uh once
48:13 you get more data points on what works
48:15 what doesn't uh what is like when you
48:17 learn what the value is
48:19 for Consulting
48:22 you know like the way we look at this is
48:25 also like it's not that like we we
48:26 charge the daily rates
48:29 um but it's also not that someone is
48:30 paying this for our time someone is
48:32 paying us for the fight that we've seen
48:34 things uh multiple times and we will be
48:38 able to tell people uh and navigate a
48:42 situation that have never seen before
48:43 and we did
48:45 um so that's that's why the pricing is
48:47 based off of that the other thing when
48:50 you're hiring external
48:53 um you know we can be fired at well
48:56 tomorrow you can tell us that we don't
48:57 we don't want to work like we don't want
49:00 to work together and that's perfectly
49:01 fine and that's where that premium goes
49:03 as well so that's for us we compensate
49:05 that you know tomorrow we're not a
49:07 full-time employee especially in Germany
49:08 it's not like only past probation period
49:10 it's very difficult to
49:12 um you know to let people go so you you
49:15 need to you need to include that
49:17 um so that's why you pay the premium is
49:18 there any rule of thumb I would say I
49:20 don't know take a salary of a senior
49:23 data analyst and multiply it by two or
49:25 something like that
49:28 um
49:29 no I mean you try to figure out what the
49:32 market price is like what the hourly
49:35 rate is how would you do this like how
49:36 do you figure do you see it uh do you
49:40 look at how much other Consultants
49:41 charge yeah you can I mean we we like
49:44 other we talk to each other it's you
49:46 know the community is is there and and
49:48 we talk to each other and and you know
49:51 with the ones that we know at least we
49:53 kind of know what the what the ballpark
49:55 pricing is and what everyone charges and
49:57 that's that's okay uh when we when we
50:01 first started and we had the first like
50:03 one of the first clients it was a
50:06 um a person that we knew
50:08 um and he was also like giving us advice
50:11 on on startups and how to build the
50:13 company Etc so and he had experience
50:16 with option actually action Consulting
50:18 as well and he said like we quoted like
50:19 so you know how much do you charge and
50:22 we said okay we want this and then he
50:24 looked at us and said like you know what
50:26 um next time you do this I'm very happy
50:28 to take that price next time you do this
50:30 um double it
50:33 and so did you end up doing this uh did
50:36 you end up doubling it for that person
50:38 or no okay for the next for the next
50:40 clients yeah so the other the other
50:42 thing the other other thing is is what
50:45 is what is really good to think about is
50:47 to figure out what is your maximum right
50:50 like what is what is your starting rate
50:52 like what is the ideal that you want to
50:54 charge and obviously it cannot be
50:55 ridiculous right I can so I'm gonna
50:57 charge I don't know one thousand per
50:59 hour that's just not gonna fly it's
51:01 it's impossible but you need to figure
51:03 out okay
51:06 I mean maybe it depends on what you do
51:08 it depends on what you do right but not
51:11 in the data space right not in the data
51:13 space now so what do you think if you
51:16 figure out how you can sell at one hour
51:18 of your work one thousand let me know
51:20 so I guess usually it's like 1 000 for a
51:23 day right or something like that yeah
51:24 yeah
51:26 that would be that would that's that's
51:27 Paul Park uh the rights and that depends
51:30 you know it depends on on what kind of
51:32 work you're doing and how long you want
51:34 to uh how long is the collaboration with
51:37 the with the client is going to last and
51:40 so you you want to so this is your
51:42 starting rate and then you also need to
51:44 think about the absolute bare minimum
51:46 that you are willing to take the job for
51:50 um and this is useful because
51:52 when you when someone asks you about a
51:55 price and even if it's a you know a
51:57 friendly uh company owner like someone
52:00 that comes from the network like or you
52:03 know or from from close friends or
52:04 whatever and they ask you please make me
52:06 a good deal never ever start with a good
52:08 deal because no matter what you quote
52:10 people try to bring it down and we made
52:13 that mistake a few times actually good
52:14 friends right
52:15 we made that we made that mistake a few
52:18 times so right now we're always starting
52:20 with this is our starting right and then
52:23 no matter what it is people always try
52:26 to bring in
52:28 and then you know you start with the
52:29 high one and then you basically end up
52:31 more or less in in what is what is
52:33 acceptable
52:35 okay
52:37 with the daily price
52:39 um
52:40 I have no experience in Consulting just
52:42 something that uh that's on my mind is
52:45 you have this
52:47 um incentive to work for more days
52:51 so instead of you know thinking what is
52:53 the most effective way to solve the
52:55 problem
52:56 and have a solution uh you start
52:59 thinking about days like okay like I
53:00 need six months for that and then this
53:03 is how much it will cost right so you
53:06 kind of create incentive that maybe like
53:08 for you you don't even realize that
53:10 because it's like our internal bias to
53:13 work more
53:16 this is an excellent question this is an
53:19 excellent question so
53:21 and you're right like I mean there is an
53:23 incentive to be to be working to to work
53:26 more days Etc now we try and I'm like
53:29 I'm being very honest like we try really
53:31 like not to do it we try to really you
53:34 know be honest and say like
53:35 you know this will take X days and then
53:38 maybe maybe it will take more maybe
53:39 we'll take less
53:41 um
53:41 and you know our incentive is at the end
53:44 of the day we'll help because if you
53:47 know there's also a very big incentive
53:49 for you to do a good job and for the
53:51 client to be happy because if the
53:53 clients
53:54 exactly because of the client is not
53:56 happy
53:57 you know they're not going to refer you
53:59 they actually might you know this is
54:01 it's this is a small world everyone
54:03 knows each other like um especially like
54:05 in a startup ecosystem in Germany and
54:07 even like in Europe in general like
54:09 people talk so you know the fact that
54:12 you didn't do a very good job is people
54:14 are going to hear about it and you don't
54:16 want that you want them to be happy you
54:17 want them to be you want you want to
54:19 refer you want them to refer you
54:22 um because no one goes into
54:24 um into Google search or these days Bing
54:26 if Now Bing is a thing again
54:29 um and says okay who like I need data
54:31 Consultants like who are data from no
54:33 like you go to someone that you know and
54:35 ask hey do you know it and that's that's
54:37 how this search happens so you want you
54:39 want Happy clients so you know if your
54:41 incentive is to ride a Sloan and then
54:44 ride on the you know maybe an experience
54:46 or or the fact that they know they don't
54:49 know how certain things go work or they
54:52 don't know the attack or they don't know
54:54 how long it's gonna take like it's gonna
54:56 bite you at some point
54:58 so there is also incentive tool to to
55:00 avoid that and there's an incentive to
55:02 to kind of be honest and actually
55:04 helpful to your customers then there is
55:07 another thing that you know you can
55:09 you can turn around and say okay let's
55:12 let's charge for a project
55:15 the problem with that is
55:18 unless you are
55:20 no that's no there's I mean okay in
55:24 general it's very impossible to know
55:27 what a deliverable should cost because
55:30 you don't know how much it's going to
55:31 take before you actually start yeah you
55:33 need to do a few iterations right so you
55:34 cannot just come with a project proposal
55:37 that you know you deliver and you shake
55:40 hands and you exactly Pathways right
55:42 make a few iterations if there is a if
55:46 there is manual work involved and you
55:48 know you can automate certain things
55:50 that's obviously possible you can build
55:52 little tools for yourself don't make
55:53 your next project easier if it's the
55:55 same type of a project but you know
55:57 the main time the main the main
55:59 [Music]
56:01 effort that we do on our projects is
56:03 really data goes into Data modeling and
56:06 that mapping of the business into into
56:07 SQL tables and business entities Etc so
56:10 that you can actually make this thing
56:11 useful for the rest of the company
56:15 um
56:16 you don't know how much time it's going
56:18 to say you can ballpark things of course
56:20 like you know if you have one source
56:22 like it's probably going to be easy I
56:23 just need to figure out One Source right
56:26 um if it's
56:27 um if it's your application database
56:29 okay I know I need to talk to developers
56:31 I probably can figure if you're doing if
56:33 you're an e-commerce business or if
56:35 you're a delivery company when I look at
56:37 it I will be I will know what I'm
56:38 looking at because this is not the first
56:40 time I'm looking at it but there'll
56:42 still be bugs there'll still be like
56:43 weird things
56:45 um that I will need to go and figure out
56:47 I still need to talk to you know
56:49 stakeholders
56:50 um some of them are not like super
56:54 available because they're also busy
56:55 people so you might be rescheduling
56:57 things you need to figure out you need
56:59 to get a feel for what the stakeholder
57:00 you know how they like to be uh
57:03 communicated with
57:05 um you need to get a feel of okay how do
57:07 I how do I get the information that I
57:09 need from those people so there is
57:10 always that kind of uncertainty because
57:13 you never know we're going to discover
57:14 and usually
57:18 to project how much something is gonna
57:21 how much something should cost based on
57:24 the effort that is going on so because
57:25 you just don't know
57:27 and then at some point like if you if
57:29 you do these projects then there's
57:32 always one side that is unhappy either
57:34 it took less time right because it's
57:37 possible like it's it's very viable that
57:39 like this super easy I wouldn't solve it
57:41 in a week right and we're charging like
57:43 for a month of work then the client will
57:45 be unhappy because now the the client
57:47 thinks they're being overcharged or you
57:50 spend a significant more amount of time
57:52 on it and then it's just unprofitable
57:54 for you
57:55 yeah
57:57 right uh so we don't have a lot of time
57:59 so maybe I'll ask a very quick question
58:00 just yes and yes or no answer uh is
58:03 Germany a good country to register a
58:07 consultancy company
58:09 yes and no okay good consultant would
58:12 say the answer is yes and no because if
58:15 you are you if you
58:17 primarily Target German companies German
58:22 small medium-sized companies or German
58:24 Enterprises then yes Germany is a good
58:26 place to find found a company because
58:29 those
58:31 clients will treat you seriously or
58:34 actually will consider you at all if you
58:36 have a company in Germany and ideally
58:39 that company is getting bad uh which is
58:42 one which is a complex form of uh of the
58:44 corporations especially in Germany if
58:48 you don't care who your customers like
58:51 where where your customers are if it's
58:52 like Europe
58:54 um Etc or your customers are primarily
58:57 like startups then you can consider
59:00 other countries
59:01 um you can do Netherlands and it's very
59:03 easy you can do most of it online it's
59:05 very quick everything is in English you
59:07 can consider Estonia
59:10 um because then it's then it's just
59:12 Simplicity you know doing it in Germany
59:14 has a certain amount of bureaucracy
59:16 involved um
59:18 with it and that comes with it which we
59:20 learned the hard way where are you
59:23 registered
59:24 in in Germany in Germany okay okay
59:29 um the last question uh are there any
59:31 books or other resources that you can
59:33 recommend to or listeners other than the
59:36 mom test
59:37 um
59:41 yes there is one that is very
59:43 interesting that
59:45 um it's called think like a rocket
59:46 scientist
59:47 okay and it's written by an actual
59:51 rocket scientist
59:53 um a person the guy was a was working
59:57 for NASA and he was working on the team
1:00:00 operational team that was uh sending the
1:00:04 um things to Mars
1:00:07 um and and it's basically it's a
1:00:11 deconstructs away how you approach
1:00:14 projects and how you how you should be
1:00:16 thinking about projects
1:00:18 um it has a lot of overlap with like how
1:00:21 you would build software like it's like
1:00:22 well we should test you should test Etc
1:00:24 but it's just basically it shows you
1:00:27 um it breaks down how you should start
1:00:29 with your problem or like the big idea
1:00:31 and then kind of reverse engineer
1:00:34 um and start like and formulate for a
1:00:36 plan from uh from the top down rather
1:00:39 than just like trying things
1:00:41 um randomly and it's it's written in a
1:00:44 very easy easy way and they're like
1:00:45 really cool examples
1:00:48 um and real stories from like you know
1:00:49 how
1:00:50 um from like the space missions and how
1:00:53 NASA you know screw things up
1:00:56 um it's uh so it's it's an easy light
1:00:58 read but it's um it actually there's a
1:01:01 lot of good advice so if you you know if
