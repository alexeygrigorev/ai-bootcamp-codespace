0:03 so
0:04 thank you uh everyone for coming today
0:07 um so this event is brought to you by
0:09 datatalks.club
0:10 so this is a community of people
0:13 interested in
0:14 different uh aspects of
0:17 beta data scientists machine learning
0:19 engineers data engineers
0:20 product managers and so on so we have
0:23 weekly events
0:26 we have events with presentations
0:29 so next week we'll have an event
0:33 about serverless machine learning with
0:34 aws
0:36 lambda and then a week after that we'll
0:39 talk about a new service from aws
0:41 called aws glue data brew so these
0:44 events happen
0:45 on tuesday 5 p.m
0:48 european time and we also have events on
0:51 friday
0:52 such as this event where we
0:56 have more like a conversation so this is
0:58 a type of event
0:59 without slides we just talk on a
1:02 particular topic
1:04 and today uh that will talk about
1:06 building a data science team
1:07 then next week we'll talk about standing
1:09 out as the data scientist during the
1:11 recruitment process
1:13 and the week after that i didn't put it
1:16 on slides yet
1:17 we'll talk about mentoring
1:21 we will during now we will start
1:25 talking with that while we
1:28 have our conversation at any time feel
1:31 free to
1:32 ask your question using slido i will
1:34 share a link now
1:36 so if you want to ask something just go
1:38 to slider ask your question and then at
1:41 the end
1:41 we will go through your questions and
1:44 answer them
1:45 i will send a link now to uh
1:48 chad you will have it now
1:58 so now we have back
2:03 and then
2:06 so let me just quickly take my notes
2:09 uh so today we have a
2:13 pleasure uh to um
2:16 to have that as a guest so that
2:19 needs no introduction so if you have a
2:21 linkedin account you probably
2:22 already know him um if you don't
2:26 have a link that a linkedin account um
2:29 that has a lot of experience in uh
2:31 building data teams and this will be the
2:33 topic today
2:34 so he uh led the team at e dialer this
2:37 is a popular price comparison tool in
2:39 germany
2:40 um then he was ahead of ai at axel
2:43 springer
2:44 this is a big publication house and now
2:47 he is the cto
2:48 and the co-founder of priceloop so thank
2:50 you dot for coming to the show today
2:52 yeah thanks for having me i say
2:56 yes uh we'll start with your background
2:59 so can you please tell us how you
3:01 started your career
3:03 so how you got into machine learning and
3:06 how does this all led to becoming a cto
3:10 of your own startup yeah sure um
3:13 so i think my uh i would say my career
3:16 is not very straightforward so i
3:19 i didn't really study computer science
3:21 uh or something like this
3:23 which would probably like naturally uh
3:26 like grow into like the area of machine
3:28 learning or like you know just soft
3:30 engineering in general
3:31 so i actually studied business
3:34 so actually economics
3:38 at humber university and i was actually
3:40 more into investment banking
3:43 but you know when since i was a child i
3:46 was
3:46 a lot into gaming and uh because due to
3:49 gaming
3:50 i also got into coding you know i i
3:53 i started to do coding very early
3:58 i think with 12 or 13 you know i created
4:00 my first
4:01 uh html websites and
4:04 css i did my own uh forum and all stuff
4:07 and then
4:08 over the time i got into
4:11 more of this these areas and then i
4:14 learned to
4:14 to to program as well you know i learned
4:17 um
4:18 like turbo pascal jfe and so on so
4:22 uh and over the basically when i and
4:25 while i was investing banking
4:26 i solve a lot of problems with with
4:28 coding and programming so we're
4:30 basically
4:31 you know where my peers they it's like a
4:34 very monkey business you know you have
4:35 to copy and paste you know you sit until
4:37 two or three a.m
4:38 and you do copy and paste of things
4:40 where it just wrote like a simple vba
4:42 like a visual basic
4:44 uh script for application on on
4:47 exo right which solved my problem within
4:49 two minutes where
4:50 my piece was working for three to four
4:52 hours and i was thinking okay maybe i
4:53 should do something with
4:54 like you know with software engineering
4:56 because uh the job that i'm doing right
4:58 now
4:58 like of course it's well paid but it's a
5:00 it's a it's really a monkey business
5:03 um and then i went back to to my
5:06 graduate studies
5:07 uh i majored in in operation research
5:10 and
5:10 uh metrics and uh and um
5:13 and then yeah a friend of mine you know
5:15 he was studying statistics in munich
5:17 uh and he told me hey well this is cool
5:21 course machine learning uh by entering
5:24 you you should do it right and then
5:26 i think a lot of people did that course
5:27 at that time i think was
5:29 six years ago something or six or seven
5:31 years ago i did that course and i was
5:33 like
5:33 oh yeah that's that sounds interesting
5:35 what he's what he's doing and
5:37 uh and basically a lot of the stuff that
5:39 he actually said in the course
5:41 is something that i already did in uh at
5:44 university but it was
5:45 credit literally right because now he
5:46 called it supervised learning
5:48 uh for linear regression problems right
5:50 so i was like
5:51 okay so i know some of this stuff and uh
5:54 and now it's like you know i have a
5:56 little bit of machine learning context
5:57 but actually also
5:59 how you would actually apply it in in a
6:00 real world like in for business world
6:02 right
6:03 because you know and when you while
6:05 you're studying you just learn concepts
6:07 you learn theorems right and
6:09 and you just don't know how to use it in
6:11 real life
6:12 um and then of course at the end i had
6:15 to decide okay
6:16 where do i want to go right so should i
6:18 do a phd or
6:20 go to the industry and luckily their
6:24 accenture at the time was having a new
6:26 team it's called
6:27 advanced analytics and then i decided
6:30 okay
6:30 um i should apply there because it's a
6:32 new team you know
6:34 there um it was not the time doing a lot
6:36 of data science or something like that
6:38 it was i think
6:39 simple statistic but they were more into
6:41 like you know six or seven years
6:43 everyone was into big data right so you
6:45 know you had to learn this kind of spark
6:47 but of course in spock they had simple
6:48 stuff like linear regression
6:50 and logistic regression uh but that was
6:53 not really
6:53 my biggest interest because i knew at
6:55 the time that big data
6:57 was not was was just very difficult to
6:59 do right so a lot of people just thought
7:02 that it's so simple to do because
7:03 yeah who brought up mapreduce at the
7:06 time
7:07 and everyone was thinking okay in
7:08 germany that would work as well but
7:10 that was very difficult so that's why my
7:12 focus was more rather into
7:14 starting the data science practice in
7:16 accenture so i was one of the first one
7:17 who did like really a data science
7:19 project here in germany
7:21 um but then also
7:25 i realized that yes a company like
7:27 accenture is not something
7:28 that i wanted to work for a long time so
7:30 i i left it
7:32 uh pretty early um the reason is um
7:35 you know accenture is a big company it's
7:36 a consultancy right so there's still a
7:38 lot of overhead that you need to do
7:40 for example you know you need to do a
7:42 lot of presentations you need to talk to
7:44 clients it's more like project
7:45 management
7:46 and then you have people in india where
7:48 or maybe also in
7:49 spain you know this offshore uh center
7:52 where you basically
7:53 you have people who actually do the
7:54 delivery so we really code right
7:56 and my goal was like okay i'm still
7:58 pretty young and i like to code
8:00 you know i don't want to spend my whole
8:01 time just you know working on concepts
8:04 you know and then you know
8:06 not doing the real thing and then
8:09 i um i moved on after a year or
8:11 something i joined
8:12 pivotal pivotal is a u.s software
8:15 company
8:16 uh the main focus was actually to do
8:18 cloud foundry cloud foundry is similar
8:20 to
8:21 kubernetes so um and i joined
8:25 pivotal data where basically you know
8:27 you have uh
8:28 databases like creamplum it's also
8:30 similar to to
8:31 uh like snowflake or redshift right on
8:34 aws
8:35 like it's an mpp database and they also
8:38 have a data science team
8:39 which basically help customers to how to
8:42 like
8:42 teach them how to do just data science
8:44 right and it's also consultancy
8:46 uh but uh like a more hands-on
8:49 consultancy right so
8:50 really at pivotal i i learned you know i
8:53 got to know
8:54 one of the like the best engineers
8:56 actually on the
8:57 like one of the worlds right so uh they
8:59 taught me a lot of things like what's
9:01 paragraming what's test room development
9:04 uh devops skills you know how you
9:06 actually you know
9:07 bring data science into production right
9:09 which was quite new
9:10 like five years ago at the time because
9:13 you know everyone was talking about that
9:15 but no one really understood
9:16 like how you really get a data science
9:18 or machine learning model into
9:19 production
9:20 and uh at that time i i learned a lot
9:23 about this concept i devised my own
9:25 ideas right how
9:26 you know to make it to make it happening
9:29 right because at that time no one was
9:30 really thinking about that because
9:31 everyone was thinking
9:32 oh wow how do you create this fancy
9:35 machinery model
9:36 and do this and that and do you know all
9:38 the hyper
9:39 parameter tuning and so on but no one
9:42 really thought about
9:43 hey okay but what happens afterwards
9:45 right what happened after day two right
9:46 day one
9:47 okay it's in production but what's day
9:49 two day three day five to six right
9:50 because
9:51 it's it's not a simple uh like you know
9:54 app you know even an app when you create
9:56 an app you know you have
9:57 more feature requests you know feature
9:58 development your bucks were coming up
10:00 and you need to think about that right
10:01 and this is something um that was pretty
10:04 cool and other than that i also had to
10:06 work on nice projects you know i did my
10:08 pet projects as well i got
10:10 i got into communivision a lot
10:13 and also i work on interesting projects
10:15 like for example
10:17 hydroplaning prediction i work for many
10:19 interesting customers and i could also
10:21 travel to
10:23 many nice locations because you know
10:25 pivotal was based in silicon valley
10:27 they had their main european office in
10:30 london so
10:31 it was very cool experience that i had
10:34 with pivotal
10:36 but then of course after three years of
10:39 consultancy so i left pivotal after two
10:40 years
10:41 i realized this is you know consolity is
10:44 is nice you know you see different
10:46 customers you
10:47 you you get to know different problems
10:49 but actually you know i was
10:50 i i mean as i said i started to think
10:52 about this while i wasn't pivotal about
10:55 machine learning and production right
10:57 and then i was like
10:58 okay how do i actually you know find a
11:00 company
11:01 where i can actually test my ideas you
11:03 know and the stuff that i learned at
11:04 pivotal and you know think that it's
11:05 good
11:07 sorry and then i then what i did was
11:10 then
11:11 okay i looked up for some companies
11:13 which was interesting for me at the time
11:16 i applied it at several companies you
11:18 know uh it's of course
11:19 there were also a lot of headhunters who
11:21 you know tell me okay
11:23 this company is interesting and i
11:24 interviewed for like deutsche bahn
11:27 telecom and whatever um but but then
11:30 you know none of these bigger companies
11:32 you know was really interesting for me
11:34 because
11:34 at that time i was actually looking for
11:37 a head of
11:38 a data role like a more managerial role
11:41 but you know you know in germany usually
11:43 when you just having three years of work
11:45 experience
11:46 you never get like you know this
11:48 managerial rule because they will ask
11:49 you okay you're too young
11:51 uh you don't really have the experience
11:52 to to to showcase this right
11:55 um but despite that um i
11:58 i like there was this position in the
12:00 opening at idialo and actually the role
12:02 required to have
12:03 i think eight years of work experience
12:05 right so i was but you know
12:08 naive week
12:14 of course i applied right um and luckily
12:17 um it went through so the cto liked my
12:20 cv we had a first conversation after
12:24 this conversation you know i talked to
12:25 the ceo
12:26 you know the cpo and so on uh and then i
12:29 think the process only took two weeks
12:31 and the coolest thing is you know uh
12:34 while i was in the meeting with the ceo
12:35 and cpo
12:36 and cto actually when we met on site i
12:39 could actually
12:39 like you know like do like a little
12:42 presentation about
12:43 what you can expect from me you know in
12:45 the next two years you know what do you
12:47 expect from me
12:48 you know what are my plans and so on so
12:50 that was there was a i think
12:52 a very interesting kind of like uh
12:55 experience
12:56 like going through like you know uh like
12:59 a like a
13:00 job application right because it was not
13:02 like the usual one
13:03 okay uh we have this role and you're
13:06 gonna fill out this role but i was
13:08 literally creating my own role in the
13:10 sense right
13:11 um and then yeah i was hired as a head
13:13 of data
13:14 um i was responsible you know with other
13:17 two
13:18 co-heads for for areas like uh business
13:21 intelligence data warehouse
13:23 uh web analytics uh but then also you
13:25 know
13:26 why i was at the interview i also
13:28 pitched hey we need a data science
13:29 machine learning team you know
13:30 because idiot is a data company but you
13:33 really haven't
13:34 made use of all the data that you have
13:36 at the moment you know
13:37 uh for all the stuff uh and and the rest
13:41 story you know i i basically uh managed
13:44 to
13:44 like you know my two years at the dialo
13:47 i would say from my perspective you know
13:49 was really successful
13:50 so i hired a a a nice team out of the
13:53 people that i had
13:55 uh um why was the time we did a lot of
13:58 open source projects you know we
14:00 kind of built a brand for for diallo
14:02 that you know
14:03 now they still have a strong machine
14:06 learning team right it's not like you
14:08 know
14:09 when i left you know ideally wow
14:11 everything is gone right so everything
14:12 that i do
14:13 is also trying to build a very um
14:16 sustainable culture you know in the
14:18 company so i don't want to leave a
14:19 company
14:20 uh with with with everything but i just
14:23 want to leave the piece
14:25 there you know like that i that i build
14:27 up so that was
14:28 something that um i really liked um
14:32 but no but after two years of edialo i
14:35 mean
14:35 i also realized okay i built up this
14:38 team very successfully
14:40 uh what's next you know so i cannot stay
14:42 there forever in in a way because i was
14:45 young
14:46 i was like okay i managed to do that i
14:49 did my learnings but
14:50 what is the next step right uh and then
14:52 i decided
14:53 okay i did it for idialo but
14:56 how do you do this on a on a corporate
14:59 level
14:59 you know ideally is a corporate but how
15:02 do you do it when you
15:03 like you know i would access the same
15:05 thing to actually spring out like a
15:06 holding
15:07 right so if you have multiple units
15:09 right
15:10 how would you do that if you're in a
15:12 holding
15:13 what kind of learnings would you do
15:14 right um and then
15:16 and then i was like okay i i really like
15:19 this ai topic
15:20 um and i really you know as a springer
15:22 at the time like one and a half year ago
15:24 was like
15:24 there was no direction of they didn't
15:27 know what research was right
15:28 so it's not a company that is driven by
15:30 research because they just don't know
15:32 what research is right
15:33 but i think you know if you if you want
15:35 to be a tech company an actor springer
15:36 is
15:37 is one of the companies that is aspiring
15:39 to be a tech company
15:40 you really need this research and open
15:42 source component you know within
15:44 the whole holding and uh i was thinking
15:46 you know
15:47 and then i was approaching uh stefan
15:49 gervani kasper she's one of the board
15:50 members of the spring i was telling her
15:52 hey this is my dears you know what about
15:54 if we try to create this
15:56 uh main central function you know and
15:58 basically evangelizing
16:00 around axa springer you know uh what ai
16:03 is about what research is about and how
16:04 we actually can work together right
16:06 and actually my one of the driving
16:08 factors why i did that is actually
16:10 you know i want to turn like a springer
16:11 into a tech company so it's not
16:13 you know just taking the eye angle to
16:16 turn it into like a more
16:18 uh tech oriented company um and then i
16:21 did it
16:21 yeah i did it for one and a half years
16:23 uh i built up
16:24 very fast the ai team again because i i
16:27 took some of the
16:27 people with me from indiana they wanted
16:29 to come with me
16:31 i had a few people and my role there was
16:34 basically i mean sometimes just called
16:36 i'm a cheerleader you know
16:38 because i didn't have a lot of like
16:40 people function
16:41 right but more like how do you basically
16:44 talk to them to the managing directors
16:47 you know to the management
16:48 and basically shape them so that they go
16:51 into the right direction right because
16:53 it's much harder when you do this
16:55 because
16:56 management is very difficult right it's
16:58 not like you know you have a team and
17:00 this team is someone you hired right but
17:03 now you have many many different
17:05 like managers on the same level right
17:06 and how do you make sure that
17:08 they are going the direction uh that you
17:10 wanted to go
17:11 um and i also you know um i think
17:14 when looking back my time at oxford
17:16 springer there were a lot of up and
17:18 downs right
17:19 so the downside of course is a big
17:20 corporate uh i think
17:22 it was a big challenge for me so i i
17:24 think at the time i
17:26 thought okay two years is enough again
17:28 right to
17:29 kind of do this whole transformation but
17:32 uh
17:32 i think it take will take much longer
17:34 than to do this transformation on a
17:36 on an organizational standpoint and also
17:38 one thing that i didn't
17:40 um think through was hey to do this kind
17:43 of transformation you just need much
17:45 more people under you
17:46 to drive this transformation and also
17:48 kind of budget you know like
17:50 really uh profit and loss ownership
17:53 um but despite that i think i managed to
17:57 drive a lot of things as well you know
17:58 managed to do a couple of open source
18:00 projects again
18:01 um um i was one of the initiator of the
18:04 actual spring at techcon
18:06 which is like the first like big tech on
18:09 this uh
18:09 conference you know that we had with an
18:11 iso springer so
18:13 like pre-corona you know we we when we
18:15 did it we had like 700 participants from
18:17 all around the world
18:18 so that was really really one of the one
18:21 of the first big thing you know where we
18:22 could say
18:23 hey we're driving extra spring in the
18:25 right direction of being a tech company
18:26 right uh
18:28 and also uh the other point was
18:31 when we did the extra springer tech blog
18:34 right
18:34 so like you know where people within the
18:36 holding you know
18:38 within the companies can create articles
18:41 and blog posts
18:42 on this uh tech block right so this is
18:43 something that is still
18:45 living kind of you know after i'm gone
18:47 and i just and i really like it that is
18:49 still kind of like growing in some way
18:51 right because i started
18:52 it and you know and if i think about
18:55 this again
18:56 these are these are really where small
18:58 things you know
18:59 not very big things that that i did in a
19:02 way and
19:02 that everyone could do but you know you
19:04 just needed someone to do that you know
19:06 to start this thing so that people will
19:08 you know you
19:09 just start basically give them the the
19:12 the
19:12 freedom to basically write articles you
19:15 know or go to this
19:16 conference and so on right um
19:19 yeah and then recently um you probably
19:22 some of you seen that i i
19:24 resigned from master springer uh so i
19:26 had this uh
19:27 mind already you know when i joined as a
19:30 springer that okay i'm not gonna stay
19:31 there forever and
19:32 i either gonna do my own things or you
19:35 know find a
19:36 nice like managing director uh slash
19:39 like a very top management position so
19:40 that i can drive more things right
19:42 because
19:43 at the end of the day my creator is
19:44 always you know
19:46 um you need more ownership and sometimes
19:49 ownerships comes with power
19:50 right and power is sometimes that you
19:52 either acquire through like a
19:54 major managing director positions or you
19:56 create your own company right
19:58 because this is this is how the way when
20:00 you really want to drive things forward
20:01 by yourself
20:03 um and now and um so during corona time
20:06 you know
20:07 the idea came much stronger i was like
20:09 okay
20:10 everything is so slow everything on
20:12 screen is so slow
20:14 you know it's a covered world you cannot
20:16 be there forever right because you're
20:17 still 32
20:18 you know you're not 545 you don't have a
20:21 family yet right so you really
20:23 need to go out and still think about
20:25 okay what's the next step
20:26 and uh then i was like um
20:29 i was talking to a few friends and maybe
20:32 one idea was okay maybe you go back to
20:34 um vietnam i mean i'm not from iran i'm
20:37 from germany but uh maybe go to vietnam
20:39 and
20:39 build a constancy because the tech is
20:42 growing strong there you know
20:43 and and maybe some of maybe an idea
20:46 grows out of this right
20:47 but luckily um my my current co-founder
20:50 so dr richard schwenke
20:52 uh he approached me uh really
20:55 you know we left at the same time from
20:57 our companies uh richard had
20:59 co-founded contoren already which is a
21:03 e-commerce for for like uh you know
21:05 tooling and so on
21:06 um like for b2b business and uh
21:10 he he co-owned the company was he was
21:12 the managing director
21:14 but he saw the company 2017 already so
21:17 and he actually
21:18 wanted to create another company again
21:20 you know to
21:21 to have this you know feeling as well
21:23 because he's also
21:24 not that old and he still really wanted
21:26 to still to
21:27 you know create a company from scratch
21:28 because if you i would say
21:30 two or it can be very very uh tiring
21:33 right you know in the startup to
21:34 to create something from scratch again
21:36 and then yeah you approached me with
21:38 this idea of
21:39 uh of pricing because he uh he created
21:42 his
21:42 data science team at contorian already
21:47 and they like implemented a pricing
21:50 frame
21:50 like algorithm and they've they've been
21:53 dealing with
21:54 pricing for three years already and they
21:56 also had like an uplift of 25
21:58 you know with with the things they've
21:59 been doing and they did a lot of am
22:01 testing to find the right
22:02 calibration hyper parameters for the
22:04 machine learning models and so on
22:06 uh and i just thought like oh yeah
22:07 that's a nice idea i had
22:09 um pricing already at university because
22:12 you know when you're doing operation
22:13 research
22:14 you also will focus with markdown
22:15 management revenue management or
22:17 also dynamic programming right so it has
22:19 a lot of things to do with with pricing
22:21 because pricing
22:22 is at the end of the day a decision that
22:23 you need to do in a control theory right
22:26 um and i was like yeah that sounds like
22:29 a good idea
22:30 and he was looking for a technical
22:31 co-founder and i actually was looking
22:33 also for a business co-founder right and
22:35 uh so that's that's way it was it was a
22:38 really good combination
22:40 of us too and yeah i think we had this
22:42 discussion like i think around august or
22:44 something like that
22:45 and then i was already clear okay i'm
22:47 gonna resign from the company
22:48 right uh and he was also yeah okay i'm
22:51 gonna leave
22:52 october as well right so end of
22:54 september um
22:55 and kind of like luckily we left end of
22:58 september both at the same time
23:00 and now we uh basically started price
23:02 loop right so press loop is
23:04 is my new venture together with richard
23:07 and our goal is basically
23:11 i would say we want to disrupt the
23:13 pricing uh
23:14 industry right in a way because um
23:18 as far as you know there's many like ai
23:21 software as a service
23:22 uh systems out there or and and or not
23:25 even
23:26 that but just ai soft as a service in
23:28 general like not only for pricing
23:30 and most of these pricing software are
23:33 actually like more closed solutions so
23:36 basically you know you
23:37 you you you get the data and you get the
23:40 data from your client your customer
23:42 they give you the data and then you put
23:44 it into your system maybe you have a
23:45 login right
23:46 uh and it's probably hosted on some
23:48 cloud provider and then
23:50 you give out the price right so that's
23:52 that's most of the service or
23:54 any other service computer version
23:55 servers could be the same right you give
23:56 the data
23:57 and then you get the labels and and so
23:59 on right but what we actually want to do
24:01 is
24:01 um we want to create like a pricing
24:04 framework or library uh at the end right
24:06 so we basically
24:08 want to like you know give data science
24:10 teams pricing teams you know
24:12 like a like a pricing framework at the
24:14 end of the day
24:15 so that people you know like you
24:17 yourself maybe don't ex will use us in
24:19 the future
24:20 right because it's so easy to create
24:22 your own uh kind of pricing strategies
24:24 right
24:24 and then of course we have commercial uh
24:27 solutions
24:28 on top of that you know which which we
24:30 uh
24:31 will will um will you know offer this to
24:35 to to other customers right because if
24:37 they like to use our
24:38 our our framework at the end of day you
24:41 know um
24:42 you know if we we are a company right we
24:44 also need to finance ourselves in some
24:46 way right
24:47 um but the overall goal is actually to
24:49 create a
24:50 white box solutions right so we don't
24:52 want to take away
24:54 you know the pricing manager right we
24:56 don't want to like you know
24:57 tell them hey if you're going to use
24:59 this you don't need to uh
25:01 like hire a pricing manager or you can
25:03 fire the pricing manager no
25:04 we want to give them a frame of a tool
25:06 so that basically you know
25:08 they can make better decisions with
25:10 their pricing teams right and you know
25:11 you
25:12 and pricing is a core component of many
25:14 many companies right
25:15 and that shouldn't be like uh like a
25:17 black box solutions
25:19 yeah that's where i am so far it's a
25:22 it's a nice interesting ride
25:25 a long story but too very what stood out
25:28 to me was uh
25:29 well first of all you mentioned andrew
25:31 hank and this uh course on coursera i
25:33 think so many people
25:35 ended up where they are now because of
25:37 that course myself including
25:39 uh yeah because like it changed the the
25:42 lives of so many people so this is
25:44 amazing um and then indeed like
25:47 i remember i started for following you
25:49 on linkedin when you
25:51 were already at idio and then so many
25:54 projects
25:55 i found out like open source project
25:57 that you contributed like your team
25:58 contributed like uh
26:00 remember this uh um i think there was a
26:03 quality library image quality library
26:05 then the duplication library image
26:07 duplication
26:08 yeah that's uh amazing so to me like i
26:11 i saw that okay this team is doing great
26:14 on
26:14 open source front uh like pushing out
26:17 amazing stuff and then
26:19 having also a lot of stars on github
26:21 which shows that a lot of people are
26:23 interested that that's uh
26:25 that's a great job and uh yeah i'm
26:28 curious about your startup now
26:30 so you you you you said you just started
26:33 it so you
26:34 richard and you and do you have somebody
26:36 else working with you now or
26:38 yeah yeah so i think i think the way how
26:41 we start our startup is not very usual
26:44 so since both of us are kind of
26:47 experienced we
26:48 uh so i mean we just finalized our
26:51 preset funding
26:52 um we already made four
26:56 so we already signed four people so
27:00 one of the machine engineers just
27:01 started this week already
27:03 so three is coming we're going to make
27:06 two
27:07 offers more we want to be 10 people
27:09 hopefully by q2
27:11 2021 right uh and then we
27:14 are going to plan to do our like we're
27:16 planning to do our
27:18 um like seat round in in 2021
27:21 right um and then we're gonna hire more
27:24 people so our goal is really to create a
27:25 very
27:26 like strong technical product team
27:30 which really focus on disrupting like
27:33 one of the industries that we think at
27:34 the moment
27:35 is is is is kind of like
27:39 close right like um not really open
27:42 to to the self and we believe that you
27:45 know
27:45 uh the future is open you know open
27:48 research
27:49 and actually contribution from outside
27:51 and basically contributing
27:53 you know in ideas from many many
27:55 different organizations
27:56 and you know we see that direction from
27:58 other startups that is building the
27:59 direction like hugging phases
28:01 similar example right nfp is
28:04 is getting so strong you know and people
28:06 are like you know using
28:07 production is because of the open
28:09 research and of stuff and
28:10 at the moment i see i haven't seen that
28:13 in pricing so far yeah but that's a
28:16 amazing topic i see that many many
28:19 different companies e-commerce companies
28:21 will benefit from that so that's a
28:23 an amazing idea and i
28:26 i know that it will all work out so now
28:30 what i hear is now you're already in a
28:32 process of building a team so you
28:33 already
28:34 um so some people already signed offers
28:37 and soon start working so how
28:41 how do you start building a team like
28:45 how do you how do you use the how do you
28:48 approach this process like
28:49 what should you do first like do you
28:50 select a project first to do or you
28:52 start
28:53 immediately with hiring like how to
28:55 approach this process
28:57 yeah i think i think i mean
29:00 it's hard to basically uh kind of
29:03 rationalize my
29:04 my mind you know in in some way
29:07 i would say it's a combination of both
29:09 because some companies they just start
29:10 with hiring people and then they build
29:12 first right
29:13 and some companies they need a big big
29:15 plan now you know
29:16 and then they're going to hire people uh
29:19 what my or what our approach is
29:21 uh you know this is together also you
29:23 know aligning with my co-founder
29:25 and of course i'm driving it from the
29:27 technical perspective is uh of course we
29:29 have a project we know what we're gonna
29:30 build you know
29:31 but it's not it's still unclear you know
29:33 i'm clearly the way that
29:35 we don't know the we know what the end
29:37 goal should be like the vision
29:38 right but we just don't know which
29:40 features you know will lead to this kind
29:42 of things right
29:43 and then we are hiring like different
29:45 roads that would take
29:46 us to that point to get a better
29:48 understanding to our vision right
29:50 um and and as as you said we're building
29:54 like a like a open framework right like
29:56 a library
29:57 which means you know it's a it's a
29:59 strong like
30:01 software engineering project which means
30:02 you know we need
30:04 very good uh sub engineers you know who
30:07 understands
30:08 uh you know like how to grade like
30:10 abstract libraries
30:11 right um since we're dealing with
30:13 machine learning we need machina
30:15 engineers right
30:16 since we're dealing with data we need
30:17 data engineers right uh
30:19 we need a product manager who you know
30:22 will prioritize these kind of things we
30:23 need
30:24 designers who will you know guide also
30:26 the api
30:27 you know maybe we'll know maybe but we
30:30 will also build a front end for the
30:31 commercial solutions right
30:33 which means we need ux ui uh
30:36 a person you know who will drive that
30:38 kind of thing
30:39 um there's a lot of i would say like you
30:42 know
30:43 roles that you think about before but
30:45 then also
30:46 um in the beginning you know you need to
30:48 also think about do you need very
30:50 um like i would say uh experienced
30:53 people
30:54 or inexperienced people versus also
30:56 generalists with a specialist
30:58 right so this is a question that you
31:00 really need to ask and and our stage is
31:02 uh we really need more experienced
31:04 people because we are early stage
31:06 startup right which means
31:07 we need to get traction as fast as
31:09 possible so that we can
31:11 raise our next funding you know and also
31:13 get
31:14 you know this mark product market fit
31:15 with our with our customers right
31:18 and then the the second thing is uh do
31:20 we need generous value specialists
31:22 uh also our case now we need more
31:24 generalist because you know
31:26 as a startup you know where when you
31:28 start you have no
31:30 lines of code right there's nothing
31:32 which means you know you need to do
31:33 back-end
31:34 front-end devops and whatever what
31:37 what happens there right uh whereas when
31:40 you're a specialist you're more like
31:41 focused
31:42 okay i just want to tune this specific
31:44 carburetor meter
31:46 yeah like it's an interesting discussion
31:49 this uh
31:49 specialist versus generalist and uh i'm
31:52 wondering let's say
31:54 if you were still at idialo so who would
31:57 you prefer to hire back then
31:59 like if you wanted to hire somebody in
32:01 your team like would it be a general
32:03 specialist or would it matter actually
32:05 yeah
32:06 when i started in dialo or no like
32:11 let's say you have a team you're working
32:13 already in a big
32:14 company in startup it's clear right you
32:18 want to have
32:19 you know these people who can do pretty
32:20 much everything but let's say it's a
32:23 mid-sized company like ideally it's not
32:25 a large corporation but it's
32:27 already not a startup for these kind of
32:30 companies
32:31 who would you prefer to hire yeah i
32:33 understand
32:34 um i think it depends as well like where
32:37 you are in the organization
32:38 transformation right i think there's
32:40 there was this graph where you where you
32:42 have like how much data driven
32:44 is actually the company right if if the
32:46 data is
32:47 uh very immature like at the beginning
32:50 you know they don't have a data analysis
32:52 or
32:52 like a data team before you know it
32:54 makes sense to hire like a data analyst
32:57 before and also data engineers you know
32:59 who build up the
33:00 the kind of backbone of this right
33:03 and then over time you know you can
33:05 start to hire more different roles you
33:07 know like
33:08 data scientists or machine engineers
33:10 right who will bring up the intelligence
33:12 i think that was also this famous uh um
33:16 kind of pyramid right where you
33:17 basically the
33:20 beginning you know on the bottom you
33:22 have this uh
33:24 data right you need to clean the data
33:26 you have very messy data you clean the
33:27 data
33:28 and then on top like this very thin
33:30 slice was actually the intelligence
33:32 and then the machine learning part right
33:35 um
33:35 eddie diallo if i would map it to diallo
33:39 the problem
33:39 um i would say diallo was uh not
33:43 very mature but also not completely
33:45 immature it was the middle
33:46 of this transformation right so they
33:48 knew uh what kind of
33:51 they had data analysts before they had
33:53 business intelligence people
33:54 they also had data engineering you know
33:56 who but who used to work very on
33:58 on a very old database right um and then
34:01 when you see that you know you have to
34:03 complement this right that means
34:05 okay you don't need generalists in data
34:07 science so you need more specialists and
34:08 data science because they
34:10 they then the topics are there but you
34:12 need
34:13 people who work on that but of course
34:15 you don't need
34:16 super like specialists so they need a
34:18 little bit of towards the a little bit
34:20 of generous level
34:21 because you know idialo was very new in
34:24 machine learning which means
34:25 okay these people i hired also need to
34:29 like put things into production you know
34:31 they need to cooperate with the data
34:32 engineer because the engine didn't
34:34 understand what machine learning was
34:35 about right so you know you really
34:37 needed
34:38 a kind of empathy to work these people
34:40 together to bring things into production
34:42 right
34:43 um for example if idialo would
34:46 already be in that stage you know like
34:48 they they have already machine learned
34:49 in production they
34:50 uh they know how to use it then you know
34:53 it makes sense to go
34:54 towards this super specialist which
34:56 would mean like more
34:58 research oriented jobs right because
35:00 then you're only researching and not
35:01 really
35:02 like taking care of other stuff that
35:04 would make sense
35:06 yeah interesting things yeah going
35:10 going back to your uh to your current
35:12 company
35:13 price loop um so you mentioned that you
35:16 want to hire
35:16 a lot of different people you want to
35:18 hire a product manager you want to hire
35:20 a
35:21 front-end engineer back-end engineer ui
35:24 ux
35:25 data engineer you said that machine
35:28 learning engineer also
35:30 is starting soon how do this how do you
35:32 decide who to hire
35:33 first like or you already you know who
35:36 to hire like five different roles and
35:38 you start hiring
35:38 or you'd rather focus on one specific
35:40 role yeah
35:42 first i mean i mean we open a couple of
35:44 roads but of course in my head
35:46 we already you know we have to start
35:48 with certain roads right
35:49 so uh for example uh our first
35:52 uh goal was to hire machine engineers
35:54 and software engineers and actually
35:56 machine learning
35:57 engineers who are very close to be sub
35:59 engineers you know like actually
36:00 software engineers
36:01 who know a lot about machine learning
36:02 engineers at the end of the day right
36:04 uh and then over time we can hire
36:06 product managers more and also
36:08 you know the engineers because at the
36:10 beginning you know you have to think
36:12 about you need people who can work on
36:13 the prototype you know
36:15 when working with mvp who do a lot of
36:17 coding you know who will work on the
36:19 product right
36:20 it doesn't make sense that you're going
36:21 to hire like a ux ui designer when
36:23 you have no work for them right so you
36:25 really need to understand
36:27 okay at which stage are you right and
36:30 what kind of voice do you need
36:31 now to solve this problem right and then
36:34 also of course
36:35 what would you need these roles in the
36:37 future going forward right you cannot
36:39 hire someone
36:40 just for six months then you just need a
36:41 freelancer but we want to create a
36:43 company that is
36:44 more sustainable and longer so that
36:46 means we you know we want to keep these
36:47 people
36:48 longer and then just in six months
36:52 yeah so basically what you're saying is
36:55 start with hiring engineers
36:56 back into engineers who know machine
36:58 learning and then they will build the
37:00 backbone
37:01 like all that they can also probably
37:04 take care of the
37:05 data engineering like all these data
37:07 pipelines and then of course you
37:09 then add on top of that uh maybe uh
37:12 analysts
37:13 uh then um ui ux product managers but
37:17 like you need to have this
37:18 backbone and then you need to hire an
37:20 engineer for that right right
37:22 okay yeah um
37:26 so you mentioned a couple of things
37:30 previously and one that i
37:34 that stood out for me was um so you want
37:37 to build a strong
37:38 product team right and what does it mean
37:41 to you a strong product team
37:44 well i mean a strong product team is is
37:47 for me a team
37:49 that is building a product that actually
37:51 at the end of the day
37:52 a customer wants right and strong strong
37:55 means also
37:56 very customer centric right
37:59 which means also that we deliver
38:01 features uh
38:02 very fast right like you know and test
38:05 these things
38:06 out with our customers very fast so that
38:08 at the end of the day
38:09 you know i want to build a product that
38:12 a customer
38:13 or user would say i love to use your
38:16 product
38:16 right like it's the same thing you know
38:18 when i create we create these libraries
38:19 like and put it open source
38:21 we're creating libraries that people at
38:22 the end of the day will say wow
38:24 the thing that you build is very useful
38:26 for us you know this is something
38:28 that i would like to hear in the future
38:31 how do you build such like it's amazing
38:33 right being customer-centric
38:35 being able to iterate fast get this
38:38 feedback and make sure like you have
38:40 this feed that customers really want to
38:41 use what you're creating but how do you
38:44 make sure the team can do that like is
38:46 there any secret sauce or
38:49 i mean i wouldn't say there are secret
38:52 sauces it's just the way how you create
38:53 a culture
38:54 right i mean if you if you look at high
38:56 performance teams and
38:58 culture you know with with their
38:59 managers it's actually
39:01 just both down to the culture that you
39:03 create in this
39:04 environment and um for me it's like we
39:07 don't want to do a bingo like
39:09 scrum bingo right we we're not
39:11 going to be like
39:12 hey we're going to now hire an hr coach
39:14 or whatever to do
39:15 like you know agile bingo right but we
39:18 want to
39:19 have people who work towards a mission
39:21 like you know and our my
39:22 and our job like for my cohort and me is
39:26 to
39:26 you know keep these people motivated you
39:28 know do everything
39:29 as much as we can so that they can work
39:32 on the problem right
39:33 and of course you know help them when
39:35 they have problems and when they get
39:37 lost with the vision right telling them
39:38 again
39:39 this is the vision that we want to go
39:40 you know this is direction
39:43 have very short feedback cycles in a way
39:46 right
39:46 um but then also of course you know like
39:49 allowing them in the future to do open
39:51 source and all stuff right so
39:52 not a lot of companies here in germany
39:54 overall they
39:56 are contributing to the open source
39:57 community in some way right
39:59 or they are doing stuff that is open you
40:01 know this is
40:02 this is something that i see really rare
40:05 in
40:05 in startups as well in companies right
40:08 not everyone like there are big
40:09 corporations who would do that right
40:11 but over in germany i would say not a
40:13 lot of companies are doing
40:14 open source yes that's uh
40:17 definitely true and
40:21 i'm wondering like with this open source
40:24 many developers
40:25 want to do this but when it comes to
40:27 actually doing this then
40:28 uh it's uh yes sometimes it's difficult
40:32 like
40:32 do you somehow try to give like some
40:35 extra motivation like how do you
40:37 motivate people
40:38 to actually go ahead and release
40:40 something to open source
40:41 or maybe with uh writing articles it's
40:44 also something people want to do but
40:46 it's often difficult like you want to
40:48 write an article but then you see it and
40:51 like you end up doing something else
40:53 instead of writing so how do you
40:54 motivate people to actually do that
40:56 i mean if you if you look at my past
40:58 teams right uh
41:00 most of them who joined me before and
41:02 never did anything open source or
41:04 wrote an article before right uh you
41:07 know i i just
41:08 like i'm very pragmatic manager so i i
41:11 do one-on-ones you know in this talk i
41:13 i talk with them hey this i give them
41:15 suggestions hey this would be nice if
41:16 you would write something like this or
41:18 this would be nice for the community if
41:20 we do some open source like that
41:22 and overall i just you know talk to them
41:25 and
41:26 give them inspiration right and the rest
41:28 is up to them right and then they
41:30 st some of them started to write you
41:32 know and then they were stuck and
41:34 i was telling them hey okay maybe you
41:35 could do something like this then you
41:37 know
41:37 do that right and then they just took
41:39 that you know there's an idea you know i
41:40 think
41:41 if you really want to like you know
41:43 create this kind of culture
41:45 you really need to work with these
41:47 people right you really need to give
41:49 them the inspiration because some of
41:50 them
41:51 like don't have the courage basically to
41:54 start with that
41:55 and then if they and if they found the
41:56 courage to start with this
41:58 they maybe are a little bit clueless
42:00 right there's so many articles out there
42:01 where do
42:02 i start right you as a manager and you
42:04 know i
42:05 myself i wrote a lot of articles already
42:06 you know i could start with
42:08 telling them hey if you want to do that
42:10 you know you could
42:11 like you know look at some of these
42:12 other course i think they are good you
42:14 know try to
42:15 do the introduction like this uh or in
42:17 the in the
42:18 main section i think a diagram like this
42:20 would be nice
42:22 give feedback you know and and then it
42:24 works you know
42:25 basically by example by setting an
42:28 example you said you already did that in
42:30 the past and then you're just
42:33 sharing this experience sharing this
42:35 motivation that you had
42:36 with the team and then it gets
42:38 contagious and people just start
42:40 following that and doing the rest
42:42 themselves even
42:43 even another example is conferences
42:45 before i created this
42:47 team at idialo yalo was never at a
42:50 machine learning or data conference
42:53 you know so if you think about the next
42:55 last two or three years
42:56 i could see that many of like you know
42:59 idialos
43:00 went to conferences and also i i was
43:02 very proud for example
43:04 uh christopher lennon he was one of my
43:06 first hires in piado
43:07 he spoke at strata san francisco you
43:09 know like there were two
43:11 german companies like diallo and uh the
43:14 other one was flink
43:15 you know i was really proud you know
43:17 that oh wow we made it to
43:20 strata san francisco
43:23 it's a pretty high bar
43:27 yeah that's awesome um coming back to
43:30 the
43:31 hiring process um so at some point of
43:34 course you first need to hire
43:35 engineers to make sure that like the
43:38 infrastructure is there
43:39 the data like the processes for
43:41 collecting data is there but at some
43:43 point you want to hire a data scientist
43:44 right
43:46 how do you do this uh like what is the
43:48 the process for you how does it look
43:50 like what are the qualities you check uh
43:53 what you what are the things you're
43:54 looking for in data scientists
43:56 yeah uh i think my checking is
44:00 is very i would say driven by
44:03 by how i know how i feel but you know
44:06 what i
44:06 basically looking at the cvs right so
44:08 i'm not i don't have the schema we're
44:10 like a checklist where i say
44:12 yes yes yes yes yes right he started at
44:14 stanford or
44:15 harvard or whatever right and he did
44:17 computer science he had a 4.0 gpa
44:20 and blah blah blah right but i would say
44:23 i look into
44:24 like the team so for example if i
44:26 already hire someone with this quality
44:28 i have to look the cv with someone who
44:30 has a different quality than the other
44:31 one person before
44:32 right but of course they are similar in
44:34 some way so they need the basis so
44:36 the basics is for example uh you need to
44:39 know how to program right so this is uh
44:42 for me
44:43 uh like 101. so if you don't if you
44:45 don't if you don't know how to code and
44:47 especially
44:47 if you don't know a lot about software
44:49 engineering you're already out in my
44:51 in in my uh process right um unless you
44:54 are
44:54 junior so when your junior is a little
44:56 bit different but still
44:58 i require people to have a very high
45:00 coding skills like you know
45:02 programming skills um and then other
45:04 than that
45:05 no i look at stuff that you know seem to
45:08 be interesting for the team
45:09 oh that person started mathematics wow
45:11 cool that means that person knows how to
45:13 do math right
45:14 uh that person already did some open
45:17 source projects okay
45:18 they know the process of basically uh
45:21 the whole open source process right
45:24 or um i know someone
45:27 already did a cargo challenge right but
45:29 not these
45:30 current challenges but really like a
45:32 real challenge so it means wow that
45:33 person
45:34 work under pressure it's competitive you
45:36 know all this kind of stuff and then i
45:38 combine this thing together and i say
45:39 okay this could be a good fit to the
45:41 team you know that could be a good fit
45:42 to to to the to the skill set that we're
45:45 looking at right in the future
45:46 and then uh usually what i do is i do
45:49 like a first interview where i just talk
45:51 about you know all the experiences
45:53 uh whether that person is interesting
45:54 you know we also people at the end of
45:56 day and we have to work together you
45:57 know someone
45:58 is just plain boring you know this is
46:00 also very difficult for the team
46:02 you know that person also need a hobby
46:04 right i don't know
46:06 going to the cinema doing some sports or
46:08 whatever hacking is also hobby
46:10 but that person needs to do something
46:11 otherwise it's
46:14 i'm just saying you know you you really
46:16 work more time
46:18 with with that person than basically
46:20 your girlfriend or your wife you know
46:21 so you spend much more time with them
46:23 than and your personal uh
46:25 uh like you know the one the person that
46:27 you love actually right
46:29 so and that's that's why you know you
46:30 really need to understand that person
46:32 really
46:33 well you know and um and then i also
46:35 asked like ten
46:37 uh basic machine learning questions um
46:40 um some of the questions are also in
46:41 your interview
46:42 guide that you uh have in github uh so
46:46 i'm not going to disclose them
46:48 but they are one of these so basically
46:51 there are 160 questions
46:53 10 of them are there so if somebody goes
46:56 through all of them then they will pass
46:58 your interview right
47:00 yeah i would say um they should not
47:03 uh copy your answer one on one because
47:06 yes so the answer is
47:08 like probably it's a good idea to
47:10 actually look at the questions and try
47:11 to answer
47:12 themselves because what i do is i yeah
47:15 what i do is i
47:15 ask one question and then from choices
47:17 it has a random question
47:21 and when it comes to coding to
47:24 programming is there any specific
47:27 like process that you follow for taking
47:30 or how do you do this
47:32 yeah so what we then do is um the second
47:35 interview is basically homework
47:37 assignment so i send out a homework
47:39 which is not very
47:40 difficult and then you know they send me
47:42 the code
47:43 uh like you know whether this is a
47:45 jupyter notebook or whatever you know
47:46 and then i can check a little bit
47:47 already
47:48 and to be honest from this simple task
47:50 you could already
47:52 see how much how are people working
47:56 you know for example quotes some people
47:59 you know they just don't
48:00 make sure that quotes are like
48:04 like it's the same as everything right
48:06 you know that's like double quote or
48:07 single quotes right
48:08 but then when i see that people are
48:10 using single quotes and they are a
48:12 double quote and they have a single
48:13 quote again you know
48:14 i would already see okay that person is
48:16 not really taking care of a code
48:18 you know like like like writing things
48:20 yeah small things you know these kind of
48:22 small things you can always see also all
48:24 naming you know how do this person do
48:27 the naming
48:28 how will the person do some abstraction
48:30 of class as well
48:31 or is that person using pipeline so you
48:33 know from this simple task you could
48:35 already see
48:36 how someone would work you know in the
48:38 future because these are small things
48:40 that i would check because these small
48:41 things
48:42 makes a difference at the end yeah so
48:44 basically whoever is listening if you
48:46 want to go to
48:47 that's company make sure you use
48:50 same quotes throughout all the code
48:54 from my computers i think it's for
48:56 everything
49:00 that's so interesting yeah something i
49:01 personally uh
49:03 didn't actually like it just didn't
49:05 occur to me to look
49:07 at these things but that's an
49:08 interesting perspective
49:10 uh we uh just wanted to remind that you
49:13 can ask
49:14 that a question so this is in chat
49:18 so let me copy and paste the link again
49:20 so if somebody didn't see it
49:22 it's in chat so you can go there and ask
49:25 that a question and we already have one
49:28 question it was asked even before
49:30 we started this in in our slack
49:33 community
49:33 from umash so the question is uh for a
49:36 company that already has an established
49:38 data team
49:40 how how do you decide which project to
49:43 take like you probably have
49:45 a big list of different projects
49:47 initiatives
49:48 how to pick the one that to work on
49:52 i mean um this is always a very
49:55 i would say difficult question it's
49:56 risky right because let's say you have
49:58 100 projects right
50:00 and you have only limited resources
50:03 which means you need to pick the one
50:05 that has the highest return on these
50:07 ones right and basically what i do is i
50:09 have this
50:10 matrix like a two by two matrix uh you
50:13 know that i learned all the time at
50:14 perth as well
50:15 where if you on the one the x i access
50:18 uh the y axis you have the business
50:19 impact
50:20 and on the x axis you have the technical
50:22 visibility right and then
50:24 from this kind of like two dimensions
50:27 you can map up some of the projects you
50:28 know and you go into
50:30 like you know different dimensions like
50:31 when you think of business impact you
50:33 see
50:33 is that impacting revenue or uh cost
50:36 right so these are the two driving
50:37 factors
50:38 and cost revenue and you know it can
50:40 also distinguish it
50:41 as well right and the technical
50:43 feasibility isn't driven
50:45 is there a lot of legacy involved do we
50:48 need a lot of roads like data engineers
50:51 do we have a data dictionary is it
50:54 problem solvable
50:55 right for example if you think about
50:58 self-training cars it's not a very you
51:01 know
51:02 easily solvable problem with just data
51:04 science right so you need much more than
51:05 data science
51:06 you know you need hardware you need
51:08 infrastructure you need the whole
51:09 ecosystem behind that right uh or is
51:11 that something you know that you can say
51:13 okay i can drive this kind of things
51:14 right
51:15 um and then from there i would just you
51:17 know prioritize this list and then
51:19 uh look at the top three or something
51:21 like this and then
51:22 like basically work on the top three and
51:24 very important just don't work on one
51:26 project because if you work on one
51:27 project
51:28 for one year and it's going to fail you
51:30 know you're going to fail
51:32 with this one project right because to
51:34 be honest uh
51:36 you only saw the successful project that
51:38 we open source right we did we had a lot
51:40 of projects that
51:41 that of course uh no one saw it because
51:43 it never went live
51:44 right in this kind of projects you know
51:47 it's it's it's fine
51:49 the only thing is you need to decide on
51:50 a project and because you
51:52 think that it is like has a high
51:54 business impact and it's technically
51:56 feasible
51:56 and then you also need to iterate fast
51:59 right to work towards the goal very fast
52:01 and then
52:02 if you see that these things will not
52:04 work and failing
52:05 then you should really like you know cut
52:06 it down and try the other idea
52:08 so it's fair fast okay so iterate fast
52:12 fail fast
52:13 yeah and basically also bring us back to
52:16 the topic we discussed previously of
52:18 being stroked with strong product teams
52:20 right so this is
52:21 one of the aspects there we have a
52:23 couple of questions i'll share my screen
52:25 now
52:29 so and uh yes so
52:33 this uh so this question from pratap
52:36 maybe we can take it uh
52:38 uh
52:41 so if i'm about to set up a complete
52:44 data science ai team on product space
52:47 from where i need to start with this
52:49 guide so probably it's a question not
52:51 from me but
52:52 uh to you that so yeah i mean we
52:55 we asked us this uh i mean i answered
52:58 this kind of little bit already right
52:59 with uh
53:00 with my price loop question so really
53:02 you need to think about what's your
53:04 product right it's your product
53:05 software engineering project you need
53:06 several engineers at the beginning right
53:08 if your project is just a consistency uh
53:11 then you can hire any role
53:18 a question from kai how do you see the
53:21 role of
53:22 corporate i.t regarding data science i'm
53:24 not sure i completely understand it
53:28 do do you have an idea what corporate it
53:30 is
53:31 so probably maybe something uh like in
53:33 companies like excel springer
53:36 yeah i mean i mean the cover you know in
53:38 a corporate company like springer it has
53:39 a couple i.t
53:40 uh um to be honest uh
53:43 i don't i don't i don't think that uh
53:47 this corporate i.t system uh makes sense
53:50 um for like a company like access
53:51 springer going on forward in the future
53:54 because if uh is turning in a tech
53:56 company right
53:57 uh the everything that is within the
54:00 company is driven by technology right so
54:02 there will not be
54:03 like this central corporate i.t
54:05 department that you have right
54:07 and basically you know the corporate it
54:09 will be like a devops role you know
54:11 within
54:11 a whole technology company and then you
54:14 know
54:15 data science will play a part within
54:17 this technology organization
54:18 so i hope this answers the question
54:23 and to me i learned actually that i
54:26 haven't worked
54:27 in uh big corporations so now i know
54:29 that uh in some corporations there is
54:31 this corporate at department
54:33 um so another question is how do you
54:36 keep a good team
54:37 so because good people tend to get great
54:39 offers and might leave
54:41 soon so how do you keep them i mean
54:44 this is the this is the question that i
54:46 always had so far
54:48 i didn't have the problem of people
54:50 leaving me because i was
54:52 always ensuring that people are getting
54:55 paid fairly
54:56 uh and also have interesting projects
54:58 right and if you are going to balance
55:00 these things think two things out
55:02 then you know you can keep the people
55:04 for example when you start to
55:06 give people like shitty projects or when
55:09 you you know
55:10 kind of like micromanage them right then
55:12 they
55:13 they will leave you someday right and
55:14 then also when you're not going to pay
55:16 them fairly and all the stuff right
55:18 then this is also a big problem right
55:21 um that is something that i learned over
55:23 the time and
55:24 um basically this is what actually
55:27 basically kept the people
55:28 like working for me so very simple
55:31 ingredients actually
55:32 yeah two things pay well and give
55:35 interesting projects right
55:37 um so that would you prefer a
55:40 mathematician
55:41 or a computer specialist for a machine
55:43 learning position and computer
55:45 specialist probably
55:46 um somebody who graduated from uh
55:48 computer sciences department
55:50 uh as i said this question doesn't
55:52 matter because you know
55:56 basically if you have mathematicians you
55:58 need to us to code right which means you
56:00 need to be on par with a greater
56:01 scientist if you're a computer scientist
56:03 you need to
56:04 understand the math behind the machine
56:06 learning system right which is actually
56:08 obviously not so
56:09 complicated right and then you know
56:11 doesn't matter actually
56:13 so like you need to have a certain set
56:16 of skills and it doesn't matter
56:18 where you pick the skills right was it
56:20 from your university
56:22 you could also not study at all right
56:24 there are many people who do that at all
56:25 and they are very good so
56:28 yeah thank you so how to deal with the
56:31 hype
56:32 on management when building a data
56:34 science team
56:36 this is probably like a question of
56:37 exploitation management
56:39 yeah um i mean you
56:42 this is the problem when you are when
56:43 you're a new company um
56:45 and and not a new company but when
56:47 you're a company and you create this new
56:49 data science team
56:50 everyone will expect a lot of you
56:51 because you know they they know that wow
56:53 ai
56:54 they read these things they can do so
56:56 much it will increase our revenue
56:58 and costs and so on if if if you you
57:01 know if someone is opening this
57:03 new data science team you know you
57:04 really need to communicate as much as
57:06 possible
57:07 and also do a lot of education i would
57:09 say courses with with higher management
57:11 to say this is what ai can do and this
57:13 is what ai can do otherwise you will
57:15 have so many expectations that you know
57:17 you will kind of
57:18 you are expected to fail in some way
57:21 so basically work with management and
57:24 explain them
57:25 yeah so
57:29 what do you think about this
57:31 establishment of bi
57:33 di bi di
57:36 product management role so i think this
57:37 is a question about this maybe a new
57:40 uh trend uh data product manager
57:44 yeah yeah so what do you think about
57:46 this role
57:48 uh i would actually like to have it um
57:51 especially here in germany
57:52 i think you know most of the product
57:54 managers are not
57:55 really good i mean there are some really
57:57 top product managers who understands
57:59 what
57:59 uh like who are data driven and they
58:01 understand uh
58:02 what machine learning is all about but
58:05 most of the product managers are really
58:06 like business driven right
58:08 and basically uh you know if you're a
58:10 product manager you
58:11 should also be tech oriented and i i
58:12 really like actually
58:14 the case that for example you know in
58:15 the us they're much more
58:17 tech oriented product managers basically
58:19 they wear soft engineers so they
58:20 wear machine learning engineers before
58:22 and then they become product managers
58:24 right and here
58:25 there are many people who you know doing
58:27 marketing or you
58:28 they may they also just did project
58:31 management and know their product
58:32 management
58:33 but project management is not a product
58:35 management role you know
58:36 because project managing your project is
58:37 different from managing a product
58:41 do you have a couple of more minutes or
58:43 you need to go to
58:45 to some other meeting one one question
58:47 is okay
58:48 okay yes so uh we have last question is
58:52 how to start doing data science in a new
58:54 company when data quality
58:57 and organization in the company is not
58:59 good what are the required steps before
59:01 start cutting so the question was how to
59:04 start doing data science in a new
59:06 company when data quality organization
59:08 in the company is not good um i think
59:11 it's
59:11 it's it's uh i would say
59:15 kind of difficult because if the data is
59:17 not really good
59:18 uh you know it can be very challenging
59:20 to create a data science team and if you
59:22 are
59:22 uh if you are doing that you know if
59:25 you're at the stage
59:26 then you really should basically hire
59:28 data gears and basically
59:31 to basically clean up the data right in
59:33 the way and the data quality as well
59:34 have a
59:35 proper data quality process and if you
59:37 really don't have clean data you know
59:39 you can also create new data so for
59:40 example for example
59:42 for a lot of our projects in dialo we
59:44 didn't have the data right and then we
59:45 started to collect the data and this
59:47 like times you know so basically
59:48 sometimes it takes a half a year a year
59:50 to collect enough data to basically
59:52 solve this problem but you have to start
59:55 someday there's many companies they just
59:56 think
59:57 you come in as a data scientist you have
59:59 to we think that we have the data
1:00:00 already
1:00:00 right and then you're going to just do
1:00:02 that but it's not going to work this way
1:00:05 yes i can only agree with that and it
1:00:08 also
1:00:09 brings us back to your point that we
1:00:10 need to have this backbone
1:00:12 with data pipelines and all that before
1:00:15 you know thinking about machine learning
1:00:16 and hiring data scientists
1:00:18 yeah thanks a lot for um taking time to
1:00:21 come
1:00:22 here and share your knowledge with us
1:00:23 and your expertise uh thanks a lot
1:00:26 and thank you everyone for attending and
1:00:28 for your questions
1:00:30 and uh yeah we will put a video out soon
1:00:33 and uh yeah that's uh that's all
1:00:36 i think yeah the last word from you
1:00:40 no thanks for having me i think it's
1:00:42 always nice talking to you with alexa so
1:00:45 see you then someday live in person uh
1:00:48 after corona
1:00:49 hopefully soon yeah goodbye
