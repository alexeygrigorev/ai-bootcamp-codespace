0:33 predictions like forecasting time series
0:35 forecasting and then next week we will
0:37 have a workshop about using tools like
0:39 dbt and soda for
0:41 data quality so check it out we have
0:44 amazing stuff lined up

1:05 happens next week
1:07 on monday yeah it starts on monday at
1:09 the same time as this podcast so there
1:11 is also a link in the description
1:13 and then finally today during the
1:15 interview you can ask any question you
1:17 want there is a pin link in the pinned
1:20 link in the description click on this
1:22 link ask your question and i will be
1:23 covering these questions during the
1:25 interview
1:27 so
1:28 i think that's
1:30 all for the intro
1:31 now i open the questions i prepared
1:35 and
1:38 yeah i am ready to start how you already
1:40 started
1:41 sure thank you alexi um great to be here
1:44 with all your listeners
1:46 yeah okay so this week we'll talk about
1:48 being a professor and leading data
1:50 research and we have a special guest
1:52 today david david is the director of the
1:54 institute for data science at the new
1:56 jersey institute of technology he is
1:59 also a distinguished professor at the
2:00 department of data science in yingwoo i
2:03 don't know if i pronounce this correctly
2:05 for them if i don't in college of
2:08 computing his interests are in the
2:10 intersection of data science big data
2:11 high performance computing real and real
2:13 world applications including cyber
2:15 security massive scale analytics
2:18 computational genomics that's quite a
2:20 lot of interest and then so what is
2:22 interesting in uh when i
2:24 read david's bio
2:26 was that he co-authored co-authored over
2:29 300 articles and this is actually one of
2:32 the topics one of the things we will
2:34 cover today like how is it humanly
2:36 possible to actually do this
2:38 uh but yeah so that's a bit of a teaser
2:41 so welcome david
2:43 thank you and thank you for that kind
2:45 introduction so that's right i'm david
2:47 bader and now i've been
2:50 for just over three years a
2:52 distinguished professor at the new
2:53 jersey institute of technology where i
2:56 launched a brand new institute for data
2:59 science back in summer of 2019
3:02 and that institute includes a number of
3:05 centers ones related to big data to
3:08 cyber security
3:10 to medical informatics
3:12 ai and machine learning
3:13 and also fintech which is a strength of
3:16 the new jersey new york region
3:19 yeah i
3:21 kind of cut your biography a little bit
3:23 because it was too long
3:25 and i apologize maybe i left out the
3:28 important part but your biography is
3:30 amazing and that's one of the reasons we
3:34 want to have a chat today so maybe
3:37 yeah before we start before we go into
3:39 our main topic of today as leading data
3:42 research and being a professor
3:44 can you tell us about your career
3:45 journey so far
3:47 sure so i'll tell you about my career in
3:49 brief i think my full cv is over 100
3:52 pages so i'll try to limit it to just a
3:55 word or two
3:56 um but but i grew up in pennsylvania in
3:59 the united states and i did my
4:01 undergraduate and and master's degree in
4:05 electrical and computer engineering at
4:07 lehigh university and then i did a phd
4:10 in electrical and computer engineering
4:12 at the university of maryland i've held
4:14 faculty positions at the university of
4:17 new mexico where i was a regents
4:20 professor
4:21 sorry regions lecturer
4:23 and also a professor there i
4:26 joined georgia tech in 2005
4:30 to launch the school of computational
4:33 science and engineering and i was at
4:34 georgia tech for about 14 years before
4:37 moving to
4:38 the new jersey institute of technology
4:41 where i am today
4:42 so i've spent time at um quite a number
4:45 of universities and i have a research
4:48 career spanning almost 30 years
4:53 yeah that's impressive
4:55 what do you do as a professor so you
4:58 already mentioned
4:59 things like you launch at school or
5:02 do something easy something professors
5:04 do or what do you do what do you usually
5:06 do
5:08 um great question so
5:10 i um
5:12 of course i do research teaching and and
5:14 service to the institute and also to the
5:17 national and international community but
5:19 a typical day is
5:21 meeting with my students on on research
5:24 and also working with my institute my
5:27 faculty and staff to make sure that we
5:30 have
5:30 projects running new proposals that
5:33 we're submitting to sponsors
5:36 and
5:37 also i teach which means preparing for
5:40 lectures giving lectures
5:42 and interacting with students so the
5:45 core of what what i do is really
5:47 interacting with students in my research
5:50 group today i have high school students
5:52 so they're pre-college i have
5:54 undergraduate students
5:56 masters and phd students as well as
5:58 research scientists who have completed
6:01 their phd in previous years so it's
6:03 quite a diverse group of students both
6:06 men and women
6:07 and at all levels
6:11 so as a professor you do meetings with
6:13 students you keep projects running you
6:16 make sure proposals are being submitted
6:18 to sponsors interact with students right
6:20 and some of the things like projects are
6:22 running that proposals are submitting uh
6:25 being submitted
6:26 they are
6:28 like some sort of project management
6:30 right so you manage like your research
6:32 is project right and new projects and
6:34 you need to manage that it's actually
6:36 executed right people actually work on
6:38 things
6:39 yeah that's correct interpretation
6:41 so currently i have three projects from
6:44 the national science foundation in the
6:46 us
6:47 one is looking to build out massive
6:48 scale graph analytics using an open
6:51 source framework called arcuda
6:54 another is developing a streaming
6:56 analytics platform called streamwear
6:59 and
7:00 these types of projects often require
7:02 coordination among a number of personnel
7:05 and we are doing research and then we're
7:08 writing papers about the research that
7:10 that we do
7:12 so
7:13 at the same time
7:15 we're writing proposals for new projects
7:18 that will launch after this
7:20 i also work with industry quite a bit i
7:22 have active engagements today with
7:25 accenture labs we're looking at a cyber
7:28 security problem involving the use of
7:30 graphs where we're trying to find
7:32 vulnerabilities across open source
7:35 software packages and we also work with
7:37 other companies like nvidia
7:39 i have an nvidia ai lab or unveil award
7:44 at njit and i've worked with a lot of
7:46 companies in the past as well such as
7:49 intel exxonmobil
7:52 i've worked with yahoo with
7:55 with microsoft research
7:57 um quite a number of companies
7:59 and
8:00 that's really exciting to be able to be
8:02 at the forefront of developments and
8:05 looking at data science and also at the
8:08 intersection with high performance
8:10 computing and to have ideas that we
8:13 develop with our students that can then
8:15 be transitioned into practice whether
8:18 it's through
8:19 through industry or startup companies or
8:22 uh other types of organizations so i i
8:26 find it quite quite exciting
8:30 this is not something i actually
8:32 prepared for like it was the in the list
8:34 of questions but i'm really curious uh
8:37 like what does it take to actually start
8:40 a school to
8:42 like to launch a school
8:44 i guess you need to come up with some
8:46 sort of maybe it's a very simplistic
8:48 picture but i guess you need to come up
8:49 with
8:50 a bunch of projects a bunch of ideas
8:52 then you also need to have connections
8:54 with industry because you need money
8:56 right for running for establishing the
8:58 school is it like what else is required
9:00 to do
9:01 that's a great question and most faculty
9:04 will join a department at a university
9:07 and the department's been around for
9:10 anywhere from a couple years to decades
9:12 or even centuries in in europe and that
9:16 you know that that's fine but twice in
9:18 my career i've been able to essentially
9:20 do a startup within academia at georgia
9:23 tech as i mentioned i founded the school
9:25 of computational science and engineering
9:27 and here at the new jersey institute of
9:29 technology last year i founded the
9:32 department of data science so i've now
9:35 done startups twice within academia and
9:37 what it requires
9:39 the first thing that you need are people
9:41 and you need people who are really
9:43 thinking about new directions i'd like
9:46 to think about
9:47 innovation within academia is really
9:50 finding interesting work at the
9:52 interface between traditional
9:54 departments and especially in computer
9:56 and data science we find so many new
9:58 areas that are just outside of a single
10:01 discipline for instance my own research
10:04 in in massive scale analytics requires
10:07 expertise in data science in high
10:10 performance computing in systems in
10:13 algorithms and also in application areas
10:16 and so we have to weave together many
10:18 areas of knowledge to be able to produce
10:22 students who are able to really be
10:24 impactful as they graduate and they go
10:26 on in their careers
10:28 so um very briefly what what does it
10:30 take to create these these schools and
10:32 departments it takes people and also new
10:35 academic programs so we spend quite some
10:38 time thinking about what is a new
10:40 program look like for instance in data
10:42 science this past fall we launched one
10:45 of the earliest bachelor's degree
10:47 programs in data science at the new
10:49 jersey institute of technology
10:52 we've had a master's program since 2017
10:55 and we're at the cusp of launching a new
10:58 phd program in data science so i think
11:00 it's quite
11:01 quite fascinating to be able to think
11:04 about what does it take to train
11:06 students to have degree programs in
11:09 these emerging areas like data science
11:11 and i hope other universities will also
11:14 repeat the model that we've created for
11:17 this training and preparation of
11:19 students for data science
11:22 yeah so when now i realized that so when
11:24 i was asking this question i was more
11:26 thinking about research labs rather than
11:28 schools but then actually schools the
11:30 main reason for school to exist is to
11:34 teach people right so these people then
11:36 graduate and then are qualified for
11:40 the job right and this is okay
11:42 yeah and
11:44 you
11:44 to start the school
11:46 you need to see like okay there is this
11:48 university but they and then there is
11:51 this area right and
11:53 for this area there is no school for
11:55 this university right and then you
11:57 and then what happens that so you
11:58 identified this gap do you just approach
12:00 the university and say hey
12:02 like how about we just start a data
12:04 science department or you first start
12:06 working there and then you say like okay
12:09 like but these students are really great
12:11 let's start the department there or like
12:13 how does it feel so it really what i've
12:15 done is really looked at where is the
12:17 need and we see there's such a demand
12:20 right now for students educated in data
12:23 science and that need is really the the
12:26 main driver because we don't want to
12:28 just create programs that students won't
12:32 be able to find jobs in we want students
12:35 to be productive as they graduate and
12:37 data science is a growing area so first
12:40 is identifying the need and we look also
12:43 at the regions it doesn't make sense for
12:46 instance for every university to launch
12:49 every degree program
12:51 and have it
12:53 the same as every other university out
12:54 there so we really have to look at what
12:57 are the needs of the region here at new
12:59 jersey institute of technology over a
13:01 third of our students are the first time
13:04 anyone in their family is going to
13:05 college
13:07 and so we're taking students from a very
13:09 diverse background and some who are
13:13 really
13:14 new at going into higher education
13:17 within their families and we're making
13:20 them well prepared to enter the job
13:23 market the workforce in this region in
13:26 new jersey new york and the tri-state
13:29 area as well as to be
13:31 national players as well and
13:34 potentially international
13:36 um because we have students who will
13:39 either return to
13:41 countries that they came from in europe
13:43 and asia or they may find jobs that are
13:47 international in nature so we want to
13:49 have very well-rounded students
13:54 yeah and then
13:55 also one of the things
13:58 in your biography is that you're
14:00 a distinguished professor and i was
14:02 wondering
14:03 what is the difference between a just
14:06 professor and a distinguished professor
14:08 and so which one is better or can you
14:10 even say that one is better than another
14:13 so that's a designation that's unique to
14:16 every university so different
14:17 universities have different ranks
14:20 generically in the us we have assistant
14:22 professors usually they're before a
14:25 10-year
14:27 decision which
14:28 is a guarantee of employment
14:31 there are associate professors who
14:33 typically gain that promotion once
14:35 they're tenured and then they're full
14:37 professors who are
14:39 what you would think of as an
14:41 internationally known professor one
14:43 whose research has really resonated
14:46 internationally
14:47 at njit we have those three ranks as
14:50 well but we've added a fourth rank
14:53 distinguished professor where the bar is
14:56 significantly higher for that promotion
14:59 to distinguish professor so each year
15:01 just a handful
15:03 of
15:04 of um senior faculty at the professor
15:07 rank are then promoted to distinguished
15:10 professor once they are at the top
15:13 echelon of their fields
15:16 so then maybe if i'm
15:19 interpreting this correctly so professor
15:21 without any like associate assistant and
15:24 so on so this is like it describes the
15:27 type of work you do and i think this is
15:29 what you told us so you work with
15:32 students you work with research projects
15:34 you work with sponsors so this type of
15:36 work
15:37 is this is what referred
15:39 this is what we can call professor right
15:41 and then there are different
15:44 grades so to say right which maybe
15:47 like
15:48 maybe an assistant professor would
15:52 have a
15:53 like small scope right the next level
15:55 professor would have a wider scope and
15:57 so on right
15:58 so in the us which is slightly different
16:01 from the european system all professors
16:04 assistant associate and full are
16:06 typically doing research teaching and
16:08 service
16:09 the designation of assistant associate
16:13 full and even distinguished really
16:16 um
16:18 is a statement of the impact that that
16:21 professor has had so far so normally an
16:24 assistant professor may be just out of
16:26 graduate school
16:27 or has done a post-doc and joins a
16:29 faculty but they're still very early in
16:32 their career um
16:34 usually after about six to seven years a
16:37 promotion
16:38 uh and tenure decision occurs for
16:40 promotion to associate professor
16:43 and then some faculty they've associated
16:46 professor their whole year their sort of
16:48 their whole careers others when once
16:51 they've achieved national or
16:53 international recognition
16:54 then may
16:56 um
16:57 try to become a full professor at their
17:00 university which normally
17:02 uh happens maybe another six to ten
17:06 years at a minimum
17:07 um beyond their promotion to associate
17:10 professor so it takes a long time and
17:13 really it's measured by their impact
17:15 and
17:16 really the um
17:19 candidate is evaluated by peers from
17:21 other universities who then
17:23 um
17:25 write letters as to whether or not that
17:27 professor has achieved the the rank of a
17:30 full professor and the same with
17:32 distinguished professor but the bar for
17:34 distinguish is even higher than just a
17:37 full professor at njit
17:43 and what does it look before the
17:45 professorship so like i assume that it
17:47 all starts with i don't know a phd
17:50 student right so this is like the
17:52 entry level sort of uh
17:55 role into academia right yeah it's like
17:57 maybe
17:58 maybe like a graduate student right and
18:00 then phd student then after
18:03 a student graduates they can become a
18:06 postdoc right
18:08 that's right so some phd graduates will
18:11 enter a postdoc normally a postdoc is a
18:14 limited
18:15 position from one to three years in the
18:17 us
18:18 where they may join another research
18:20 group either at a university or a
18:23 national laboratory and after the
18:26 postdoc they either enter full-time
18:29 technical staff positions or assistant
18:31 professor positions within
18:34 universities
18:36 but it's not required to do a post-doc
18:38 they're a faculty who joined as an
18:40 associate professor immediately after
18:42 completing their dissertation and
18:44 getting awarded their their phd
18:46 the phd is um really an entry
18:50 degree to do research so some phd
18:53 graduates will join universities others
18:55 will join research labs at companies and
18:58 do
18:59 quite quite well in industry
19:02 and
19:04 just curious so i took a look at your
19:07 cv
19:08 and your cv is i think we talked a bit
19:10 about that your cv is 106 pages long
19:15 and
19:16 in industry like if you listen to any
19:18 podcast um
19:20 about career and cv recommendations in
19:23 this podcast they will tell you that
19:26 you should keep cv your cv at a minimum
19:30 of one page two pages max right so like
19:33 i think there is even a rule of thumb
19:35 that you should
19:37 have one page for 10 years for every 10
19:39 years of your experience
19:41 and
19:43 it looks like in academia it's
19:46 complete opposite
19:48 right
19:49 is it typical that
19:51 professors have cvs that are that long
19:55 so i think 106 pages is probably
19:58 excessive and lens for academia but
20:01 we're expected to list everything that
20:03 we've done in terms of students mentored
20:05 classes we've taught papers we've
20:07 published research projects that we have
20:11 been the lead investigator on and so on
20:14 and so my cv is just naturally long
20:17 because i've done a lot of things you
20:20 might have noticed the first page is
20:21 really a one-page
20:23 uh extended biography and that that's
20:26 really my one pager of highlights if you
20:28 don't want to read the next 105 pages
20:31 uh that that one page is great but
20:35 i've had a great career i graduated with
20:38 my phd in 1996
20:41 uh which is um
20:43 just over 25 years ago and have been
20:46 very active i've led over 90 projects
20:50 from the national science foundation
20:52 department of defense department of
20:54 energy nasa as well as working with
20:57 leading companies and i've graduated
21:00 quite a number of students and as you
21:02 mentioned earlier published
21:04 and co-authored over 300 papers
21:07 so it's been a very productive career
21:09 and hence the the extra pages in my cv
21:13 this is a typical format for academia
21:16 versus industry you're right cbs are
21:18 typically one to two pages
21:20 of highlights
21:22 um but in academia we're expected to
21:24 list everything
21:27 yeah the reason usually this happens in
21:30 industry is the hiring managers people
21:32 who decide
21:33 for a role they receive quite a lot of
21:36 applications and they simply don't have
21:38 time to go through like every
21:40 cv that's why like there's this
21:42 suggestion if you want
21:44 a hiring manager to actually look at
21:46 your cv and read then you should keep it
21:48 at the minimum but
21:49 my understanding is in in academia
21:52 that's different right so people will
21:53 actually go through and check
21:56 because a professor is a quite a big
21:59 position right so if you want to get
22:01 hired as a professor
22:02 um people take time to evaluate all the
22:06 like all the work right
22:08 that's right and it's a privilege to be
22:10 a professor
22:12 and
22:12 the
22:13 work that i've done i'm also very proud
22:16 of the service that i've accomplished
22:18 for instance i've been chairing a
22:20 committee for the national science
22:22 foundation a committee of visitors for
22:24 the office of advanced cyber
22:26 infrastructure and evaluating the nsf
22:30 office that looks at
22:33 advanced uh cyber infrastructure which
22:35 includes networks and workforce
22:38 development and some of the most capable
22:41 systems in the world for computing and
22:44 data science
22:45 so there's a lot of service that i do as
22:47 well that's quite um
22:50 well documented in my my cv so i'm very
22:53 proud of of that work and
22:56 you know i apologize if you had to make
22:58 it through those 106 pages
23:03 just curious like out of this 106 pages
23:05 how many pages are about your papers
23:07 because you said you have 300 papers
23:10 right and then you have 106 pages in cv
23:13 so
23:14 a third of the cvs papers or
23:17 less
23:18 maybe i didn't look at the actual length
23:20 but
23:21 um maybe approximately that so every
23:23 time we publish a paper in a journal or
23:26 present at a conference there's another
23:29 line that gets added to the the cv
23:32 and
23:33 it's
23:34 been quite uh quite a lot of um work but
23:38 i've had some great co-authors and
23:40 students we normally publish a few
23:42 papers a year and as you can see a few
23:45 adds up over a career that's almost 30
23:48 years and then
23:52 can you tell us about some of your
23:54 recent papers i think you mentioned
23:55 about like a few projects that you do
23:58 there was a project about
24:00 graph analytics right i
24:02 assume that this is one of the active
24:04 projects that you're working on right
24:06 now so maybe can you tell us
24:08 about some papers you've published
24:09 recently
24:10 sure so we're just finishing up a paper
24:13 right now
24:14 and
24:15 it's on a framework that we're calling
24:17 arachne the greek word for spider
24:20 and looking at interactive
24:22 graph analytics at scale
24:25 there's an open source framework called
24:27 arcuda and arcuda is a r k o u d a it's
24:33 the greek word for bear and you can find
24:35 this on github this project it started
24:39 just about three years ago as an open
24:41 source framework for doing
24:44 massive scale data science
24:47 often you may find that you have data
24:49 sets that are terabytes in size maybe
24:51 tens or dozens of terabytes and no
24:54 existing enterprise framework is able to
24:58 interact with data sets that large
25:01 and we have analysts who want to be able
25:03 to run queries
25:05 they're trained in python they like
25:08 using numpy and pandas
25:10 and what we've tried to do with our cuda
25:12 is develop a framework that
25:14 is
25:16 able to take an analyst who knows python
25:19 and substitute out numpy for arcuda be
25:22 able to look at running where the data
25:24 set may sit in a super computer on the
25:27 back end because of its size and then
25:30 operate in near real time just like
25:32 you're in your jupiter notebook and
25:35 you're running python and you issue a
25:37 command you want it to return fairly
25:39 quickly
25:40 the same way here we don't want to wait
25:42 hours and hours we want
25:44 sort of near time response so we want
25:47 the productivity of python with the
25:50 performance of a supercomputer and
25:53 that's what our cuda is providing now as
25:55 i mentioned earlier what we're building
25:57 out in our cuda is a sub piece of the
26:00 framework called arachne for graph
26:02 analytics so often our data sets
26:04 represent graphs where we have
26:06 relationships between entities and these
26:09 graphs can come from system logs maybe
26:12 we're doing some cyber security analysis
26:14 of our syslog it could come from
26:17 information about our customers
26:19 it could come from social media so many
26:21 many sources generate large volumes of
26:24 data
26:26 and we want to be able to manipulate
26:27 these data sets running graph analytics
26:30 such as connected components between us
26:32 centrality
26:34 breadth first
26:35 search and
26:37 others we want to count triangles
26:39 compute clustering coefficients find k
26:42 trusses
26:43 run new centrality measures like
26:45 triangle centrality and we're building
26:48 out the analytics to be able to do that
26:50 and this has been joint work with my
26:52 students we're publishing a paper
26:56 coming up in september at the ieee hpec
26:59 conference high performance extreme
27:02 computing that will be held in
27:04 massachusetts in september we're really
27:06 excited about this work
27:10 and what we describe sounds like a
27:12 typical startup that uh
27:15 you know like the what is it
27:16 productivity of python
27:19 with performance of high
27:21 this
27:22 super computer performance yeah that's
27:24 right exactly like it's like
27:26 a really good elevator pitch right so
27:28 like does a group and a research group
27:31 have to be
27:32 like a startup in academia
27:35 right that the research groups are like
27:37 a startup so
27:38 that's a great analogy and what we want
27:41 to do is really have impact so
27:45 instead of just publishing papers we
27:47 also produce code and it's open source
27:50 on github as well and i should mention
27:53 the productivity
27:55 front-end for our work is python our
27:58 users really use python
28:00 within jupiter notebooks very similar to
28:03 any python developer we're doing all of
28:05 the hard work
28:06 to be able to bring in a super computer
28:09 in the back end to make it seamless
28:12 so that you don't need a heroic
28:14 programmer you don't need to even know
28:15 that there's a super computer back there
28:18 we're trying to democratize super
28:19 computing and make it easy we are
28:22 leveraging an open source compiler
28:24 framework called chapel c h a p e l that
28:29 cray developed under a darpa program
28:32 about 20 years ago and is now supported
28:35 by hpe that acquired cray recently so
28:38 it's the hpe cray chapel compiler is the
28:41 framework that we're using in the
28:43 backend to be able to run whether we're
28:45 on a laptop on a cluster or a super
28:48 computer we're able to leverage this
28:51 compiler framework to get truly high
28:53 performance for the back end where we do
28:56 all of that hard work so that our user
28:59 can just call a python function and get
29:01 the result and not even know all of the
29:04 complexity
29:06 with running with a supercomputer in the
29:08 back end
29:09 but i guess the difference between a
29:11 typical startup and a research lab is
29:13 actually
29:14 a research lab right so you need to
29:17 publish papers and you correct hence you
29:20 keep your research open and this is
29:22 really good because like
29:24 not every startup company would just
29:27 open source their know how how do you
29:30 call it
29:31 that that's right so we're very much
29:33 like a startup in that we have to
29:35 acquire funds for supporting our
29:37 research lab and students
29:39 and we
29:40 also are
29:42 pushing out code
29:44 but our real deliverable is producing
29:47 students who are educated and able to
29:49 contribute in the workforce and also the
29:51 the papers that disseminate our ideas
29:55 are are the prime
29:56 deliverables that we have
29:58 i have been involved with startup
29:59 companies so i've seen also from the
30:02 other side creating some new value and
30:05 entrepreneurship and quite excited by by
30:07 the work that i've done either advising
30:10 or launching startup companies as well
30:13 so i love both sides i love the academia
30:16 side where everything's open i love also
30:18 the motive
30:20 of startup companies taking some new
30:22 idea and getting it to the market
30:25 and really impacting people's lives
30:30 you mentioned that you need to work with
30:32 terrible data sets that are terabytes
30:34 large so we
30:37 in our community we have a course about
30:39 data engineering and usually sometimes
30:42 it is a problem for us to find a good
30:44 data set for a project so maybe can you
30:47 recommend some of these data sets so you
30:49 mentioned that it is like system logs
30:51 data sets or
30:53 like are they even open
30:55 these data sets like other good open
30:57 data sets
30:58 so most companies and organizations have
31:01 massive data sets often what we do in
31:04 the research lab is either use synthetic
31:06 data sets that we create or use some of
31:08 the repositories online where we find
31:11 data sets that models social networks or
31:14 other types of for instance in our work
31:16 we look at graphs
31:18 and stanford has a very good
31:20 uh set of data sets called snap that has
31:25 um graph data sets we use many of those
31:28 but if you work with a company
31:31 or any organization they'll have
31:33 terabyte size data sets
31:35 and we're trying to screen
31:37 people to use those i don't imagine that
31:40 they're going to be opened and given to
31:42 researchers yeah exactly
31:45 i think we have to go to them so in the
31:48 past what i used to do is create our
31:50 code on synthetic data sets and then
31:52 work with companies by taking my code to
31:54 the company and then running internally
31:57 on their data sets
31:59 now because it it's a challenge to find
32:01 a data set that looks like
32:04 data sets from industry not something
32:06 pre-cleaned and you know already a cc
32:09 file
32:10 like with all the data in one csv file
32:12 compressed and it's like i don't know
32:14 two megabytes right but like something
32:16 that looks like real world messy data
32:19 that's a difficult thing to find
32:21 correct that's hard to find within
32:23 academic research but very easy to find
32:26 within industry and large organizations
32:28 so we often work with many organizations
32:32 that have these types of massive massive
32:34 data sets
32:37 and how how large is your lap
32:40 my large sorry my lab right now i have a
32:44 uh principal's uh research scientist so
32:46 a senior uh phd i have about three phd
32:50 students
32:51 about two or three master's students
32:54 um two or three undergrads
32:56 and then about two or three high school
32:59 students uh as well
33:04 the boundary between our summer semester
33:07 and our fall starts and so i have some
33:09 students graduating
33:11 and then
33:12 the numbers are
33:14 plus or minus one as students graduate
33:16 and new students join yeah that's why
33:19 two three right master students correct
33:21 it's back to school now right it starts
33:24 soon
33:25 our first day of classes is in about a
33:27 week so i'm quite excited i'll be
33:29 teaching a introductory class to big
33:32 data for graduate students and i love
33:35 teaching that class and
33:37 really training students in in data
33:39 science
33:40 uh that's the the new jersey university
33:43 right
33:44 right at new jersey institute of
33:46 technology institute yeah i'm sorry uh
33:48 and is this publicly available or is
33:50 just for the student of the university
33:52 institute
33:53 it's just for students your students
33:55 have to enroll um to take the class
33:58 yeah right
34:01 yeah so and this is the the people the
34:03 lab that is doing all this research in
34:05 graph analytics right
34:08 that's right and i i should mention that
34:10 that's my current lab but i've
34:12 quite a
34:13 large number of alumni who've gone on to
34:15 do bigger and better things some are
34:17 faculty at other universities some are
34:20 working in major companies like google
34:22 and microsoft and facebook
34:25 and some are doing startups so i have
34:28 students who
34:29 are now across many different sectors
34:32 and geographically all around the world
34:36 so i guess there is this natural how to
34:38 say cycle or because like a master study
34:41 comes and then they spent
34:43 two years
34:44 or i know how long working at the lab
34:46 some of them stay as phd students but i
34:49 guess most of them go
34:51 for apply for phd in other universities
34:54 and then you have some phd students
34:55 coming from other universities so you
34:57 have this natural
34:59 uh
35:00 like cycle of people coming and working
35:02 for a couple of years and then leaving
35:04 and then new people coming right
35:06 that's right so as a research lab and at
35:09 university i'm used to a very dynamic
35:12 and changing workforce i maintain a very
35:15 diverse set of students
35:17 and
35:18 i have them
35:19 as i train them for usually just a
35:22 couple years maybe a master's student is
35:25 up to two years a phd student maybe
35:27 three to four years and then they go up
35:30 and
35:31 take the next stage of their career
35:33 whether it's in school or
35:35 doing research at a company or
35:37 university
35:39 and you said that you also teach an
35:41 introductory course to big data right so
35:44 i'm just wondering how much time do you
35:46 spend on teaching versus doing research
35:50 that's a great question because i'm
35:52 research active i usually teach just a
35:54 couple classes per year
35:56 and
35:57 normally
35:58 maybe i i would estimate about a quarter
36:00 of my time is spent on teaching
36:02 as mentioned earlier i direct an
36:05 institute for data science at njit and i
36:08 have five
36:09 i should say four centers and one
36:11 research thrust that report the
36:13 institute there's about 40 faculty
36:16 around ngit that are part of those
36:18 centers
36:19 and we have activities related to the
36:22 institute for instance a weekly virtual
36:25 data science seminar that gets uh
36:27 broadcast through youtube we have um
36:31 other activities to bring students and
36:33 faculty together and so that takes quite
36:36 a lot of time and then i have my own
36:38 research as well in my research group
36:41 as
36:42 well
36:43 i do a lot of service for instance right
36:45 now i'm the editor-in-chief of the acm
36:47 transactions on parallel computing and
36:50 some other research rules that sorry
36:52 some other service roles that take my
36:54 time as well whether it's inside njit or
36:58 for the the
36:59 betterment of the broad computing and
37:01 data science communities
37:05 and we have a question
37:08 and the question is what is the most
37:10 rewarding project research project for
37:12 you that you have done
37:14 what is the most important research
37:16 project rewarding rewarding
37:18 oh most rewarding sorry most rewarding
37:21 um that's a great great question
37:25 so
37:26 huh
37:28 i i've done so many research uh projects
37:32 maybe i'll mention
37:34 my my highest cited paper
37:36 is one on finding the
37:40 finding an algorithm for the linear time
37:43 distance
37:44 uh between sign permutations let me just
37:48 describe this a little bit uh more
37:53 in layperson's terms
37:55 there's something called the pancake
37:57 flipping problem
37:59 where you have a stack of pancakes of
38:00 different sizes and you want to count
38:02 the minimum number of times you can put
38:06 a spatula into the stack and flip them
38:08 over to sort them from biggest on the
38:10 bottom to smallest at the top
38:12 and this problem
38:15 was a problem that bill gates actually
38:18 worked on when he was a undergraduate
38:21 student at harvard with christos papa
38:23 demetria
38:25 and
38:26 he opened
38:27 the
38:28 he created this this problem opened the
38:31 door for solutions for looking at this
38:33 problem
38:35 and back
38:36 many years ago in my career
38:38 i looked at a very similar problem
38:41 related to this where instead of a
38:43 single stack of pancakes you actually
38:45 have a
38:47 circular sack that you're putting two
38:50 spatulas in and then flipping sections
38:53 that's the called an inversion and it's
38:56 a very useful mechanism in biology
38:59 looking at evolutionary histories so i
39:02 worked on this problem
39:03 and the algorithms from the best
39:05 theoreticians were extremely complex
39:09 some had running times like order n to
39:11 the fourth order n cubed and as i worked
39:14 on this this problem we discovered that
39:17 you could solve this problem in just a
39:20 couple lines of code
39:21 in
39:23 linear time true linear time and it was
39:25 very easy to implement the only data
39:27 structure it used was a stack
39:29 so this problem
39:32 was something opened by bill gates and
39:34 we closed the problem
39:36 and we did it in such an elegant and
39:39 simple way
39:41 so that's one of the most rewarding
39:43 examples that i have of being able to
39:46 work on a problem that many others have
39:48 worked on before but getting that spark
39:50 getting that
39:52 innovation that takes a problem that
39:54 used to be really really complex and
39:56 making it almost trivial so that that
39:58 paper has been cited hundreds of times
40:00 now
40:01 and is just just a delight for me
40:05 to to see that we can still improve
40:07 things even if they they seem um if they
40:11 seem others have worked on it and god
40:14 got so far there may be a different way
40:16 of solving things there may be a new
40:18 thought and we can make these big
40:20 discoveries
40:22 so to me that that work is something
40:24 that that i really found rewarding to do
40:28 well i guess uh
40:30 like when people appreciate it inside
40:32 your paper that's good but sometimes it
40:35 happens that you put a lot of effort
40:37 into something you really like the
40:39 outcome but people just wouldn't notice
40:41 it or maybe like one two person
40:43 uh researchers cited and then that's it
40:46 like other papers like that that you
40:47 wish more people would
40:49 know about
40:52 oh another great question
40:54 so
40:55 one of the the works that we've done
40:57 it's been been cited a number of times
40:59 but it received the best paper award at
41:02 the ieee hpac conference high
41:04 performance extreme computing and it was
41:06 work that we did on a framework called
41:08 stinger and stinger stands for spatial
41:10 temporal interaction networks and graphs
41:13 essentially this was a foundational
41:15 paper looking at
41:17 analytics when your data is in motion
41:20 and you can form that data into a graph
41:23 so we described one of the earliest
41:26 processing frameworks for streaming
41:28 graphs i believe the paper is now about
41:31 10 years old and we have had a lot of
41:34 development since as we ported that work
41:36 to gpus and accelerated it it became a
41:40 package called hornet and then coograph
41:42 that you'll find in for instance
41:44 nvidia's
41:45 rapids ai framework for data science the
41:48 graph analytics are actually based on
41:50 some of their work with singer so i've
41:53 been quite excited by that it's
41:55 been somewhat of a niche looking at
41:57 streaming graphs i think we're a little
41:59 bit ahead of their time
42:01 now it's become mainstream to look at
42:03 graphs and especially streaming data
42:05 sets but i i really enjoyed that work
42:08 and working with the students as well
42:10 that helped make it possible
42:13 yeah i think this is actually like it's
42:15 an emerging topic i think uh like if you
42:17 talk if you think about
42:19 cyber security and uh like fraud
42:21 detection so this is actually a graph
42:23 right but then you get a stream of
42:25 events and then you somehow need to
42:27 um
42:28 to build a graph from this stream of
42:30 events and you need to be able to do
42:32 this fast because like if there is a
42:34 fraudster you want to catch them as fast
42:36 as possible
42:38 how it's used
42:40 correct so i've been involved with
42:42 paralyzing graph algorithms since the
42:43 1980s
42:45 um i don't know if you even remember the
42:47 1980s or
42:50 second to like i was at school with
42:52 second grade so i don't remember that
42:54 so i've always been interested in graphs
42:57 but what what has really taken off is
43:00 the fact that there are tables and
43:02 databases that you can't do a join of
43:06 those tables because the space
43:08 requirement really blows up and so we
43:10 move to graphs because you could form a
43:13 graph between relationships and you're
43:15 trading the table joins for traversing
43:19 through vertices in that graph and there
43:21 are many problems as mentioned from
43:23 cyber security from biology from social
43:25 network analysis
43:27 that
43:28 are amenable to graph representations
43:31 and there what i do is i take all of the
43:33 raw data which is really relationships
43:36 and attributes about objects and all of
43:38 the objects become vertices in the graph
43:41 and the relationships become edges and
43:43 those relationships could have
43:45 attributes they could have time stamps
43:48 there could be directions on those
43:50 relationships there could be an ontology
43:53 or not that's associated with it but
43:56 these graphs really give us a raw
43:58 and uh natural representation for many
44:00 things that we see in the real world and
44:02 so i abstract away our problems to
44:04 graphs and then i solve the algorithm
44:07 that we're looking for within a graph
44:08 framework and then map it back to the
44:10 application domain
44:13 but these graphs we've been doing this
44:15 as i mentioned for decades it's now
44:17 becoming mainstream as more
44:21 more data scientists realize the power
44:23 of graphs so i'm really excited by this
44:26 uh shift and all of the frameworks out
44:29 there that have give us given us great
44:31 capabilities for processing graphs
44:34 yeah that's interesting that you
44:36 mentioned that so maybe you know like
44:37 with deep learning so there were some
44:39 researchers that uh in the 90s did some
44:42 of the work on deep learning and then
44:44 nobody would really recognize their
44:47 effort until it was actually time right
44:49 so now like 10 years ago when people
44:53 realized that there are these gpus that
44:54 could be used and then all of a sudden
44:56 deep learning became popular right and
44:58 now this researcher
44:59 researchers who started the research way
45:02 way back now they are
45:04 very well known right so probably the
45:06 same right everything right
45:09 everything comes full circle i think it
45:11 it's cyclic
45:12 and we see things rediscovered and it's
45:15 great we have new capabilities now i
45:17 think what's also different from when i
45:19 first saw neural nets in the 1990s
45:22 now that we see it we have more
45:24 computational capabilities and we have
45:26 data sets that are available whereas
45:29 before we didn't have as much data
45:32 so i think we've had the perfect storm
45:35 of data sets
45:36 computational capability and then
45:39 really bright students who are looking
45:42 to do this type of research
45:45 and you mentioned that you are doing
45:46 some seminars and you broadcast them to
45:49 youtube how can people find these
45:51 seminars and what do you actually talk
45:53 there do you talk about things like we
45:54 discussed now like graph analytics and
45:56 things like this
45:58 that's right so for the past two years
46:00 i've had a virtual data science seminar
46:03 series during the academic semesters
46:05 wednesdays at 4 00 p.m eastern if you
46:08 want to join it live
46:09 and you can find those the previous
46:12 seminars that we posted on youtube if
46:15 you look for
46:16 njit data science you'll find our
46:19 channel that's got all of the these rich
46:22 dozens of talks that we've recorded
46:25 we're still planning our fall semester
46:27 we're going to launch our seminar series
46:29 soon so stay tuned but if you subscribe
46:32 to our youtube channel
46:33 you'll be able to get
46:35 access as those talks are live
46:38 and also
46:39 um you can see the old talks as well for
46:42 those that join live you can either
46:44 watch the broadcast on youtube or join
46:46 out on our zoom by registering and there
46:50 you can interact with the speakers as
46:51 well
46:53 so we will make sure to include links in
46:55 the description
46:59 okay so i'm just trying to see what kind
47:01 of like i remember that i prepared a lot
47:03 of questions for you
47:05 and uh
47:06 yeah one thing i really wanted to ask
47:09 you about is
47:11 i like teaching right
47:13 but if i want to go
47:15 to university and if i want to work at
47:17 university it feels like it's kind of
47:20 expected that i also do research and you
47:22 mentioned that
47:24 actually you do 25 percent
47:27 you devote 25 percent of your time to
47:29 teaching and the rest i think research
47:30 and you know all these coordinating
47:32 activities so my question is
47:34 is it
47:35 possible to join university
47:38 just to teach students or university is
47:40 not the right place for that
47:43 um so i have to apologize i'm in new
47:46 york city and something loud just passed
47:48 by the street outside so i i caught most
47:50 of the question but could you repeat it
47:52 just one more time
47:55 can i
47:56 teach at university without working
47:59 like do i have to always take part in
48:01 research if i work at university or i
48:03 can just work there and teach
48:05 great questions so there are many
48:06 different types of universities some are
48:08 research oriented universities where
48:11 faculty are expected to do both research
48:13 and teaching but there are other
48:15 universities that are
48:17 focused solely on teaching many many
48:19 universities like that as well some even
48:22 focus just on undergraduate students
48:24 and so there are some
48:26 there are some students who get a phd
48:28 and go to a teaching school where they
48:31 teach
48:32 undergraduate students and that's
48:33 fantastic as well
48:35 so we typically have a classification
48:38 for universities in the u.s called the
48:40 carnegie classification
48:43 and they're there are research extensive
48:45 and research intensive schools but also
48:47 we have teaching schools as well and
48:51 there are
48:52 you know ample universities hundreds
48:55 upon hundreds of universities of all of
48:58 these different types
49:01 but i guess if you just if you join in
49:03 university just to teach
49:05 then what may happen is that in five or
49:08 ten years what you teach becomes
49:10 obsolete right so you need to somehow
49:12 know what's the cutting edge right and
49:14 that's that's why you need to do
49:16 research and teach at the same time
49:18 correct and in computing and data
49:20 science of course everything becomes old
49:23 quite quickly so i've had to relearn and
49:26 reinvent every
49:28 few years to stay on top of
49:31 what what it means
49:33 to do computing for instance as an
49:35 undergrad for me in in the
49:38 late 1980s
49:40 probably none of that technology
49:44 we'd seen in a museum today
49:47 but the concepts are still very similar
49:50 and so
49:51 i've had to stay on top of the
49:53 technology
49:54 but the foundations usually are still
49:57 remaining that the same so still when
50:00 you're teaching there are great ways to
50:03 to stay on top
50:04 you can read publications for instance
50:07 from professional societies there are
50:09 typically journals and magazines that
50:12 help you stay on top
50:14 and you can also follow research even if
50:17 you're not doing it yourself usually
50:19 there are papers that are very
50:20 accessible
50:21 and so i'd love to read and i'd love to
50:24 stay on top of many different areas
50:26 because who knows what we'll be doing in
50:27 five years from now that the world could
50:29 change we'll be here and talking about
50:32 quantum computing and new trends that
50:34 are emerging as well
50:36 but how do you even
50:38 find time to stay on top like not only
50:41 your
50:42 you have published 300
50:44 papers so it means that you
50:46 are busy all the time writing these
50:49 papers co-authoring managing students
50:51 and so on like how do you even find time
50:54 to read papers because i imagine that
50:56 you need to read a lot of papers far
50:59 more papers than than you write right
51:03 right so i'm sitting here i always have
51:04 you know a journal next to me or
51:07 some papers to to read
51:09 and you know it's fun i i love reading
51:12 and staying on top of it to me it
51:13 doesn't feel like work
51:15 you know i can't believe that i get paid
51:17 to do this it's a lot of fun
51:19 and
51:20 you know it's exciting to look at what's
51:22 happening out there i often have my
51:25 phone close by i call up colleagues and
51:27 see what they're working on i will meet
51:29 up with with colleagues and
51:32 ask about what their research is even if
51:34 it's in a completely different area like
51:36 architecture or physics
51:38 or in the humanities so it's just great
51:42 to be able to interact with others
51:44 and at the end of the day what i want to
51:45 do is make the world a better place i
51:47 want to solve global grand challenges
51:50 and do real world problem solving and
51:53 that requires not just knowing
51:54 everything in my niche discipline and
51:56 computing and data science but really
51:58 knowing how the world works and what can
52:00 i do to solve problems that really
52:02 matter to people and populations around
52:05 the world
52:07 do you have a favorite mailing list
52:10 do i have a favorite what
52:12 a mailing list or you like how do you
52:14 know
52:15 which papers you want to eat like do you
52:17 just uh i don't know there is a
52:18 conference you open the
52:21 like the schedule for this conference
52:23 and you see what's there or you have
52:24 some sort of made in this that you
52:27 follow i guess at this point in my life
52:29 email is overwhelming so i don't have a
52:31 favorite mailing list often i'm trying
52:34 to triage email to find the the
52:36 very important pieces to respond to
52:39 um versus the advertisements and and
52:42 this and that but i typically read
52:45 the
52:47 general magazines for instance from the
52:50 ieee computer society there's the
52:54 ieee computer magazine
52:57 and then from the acm there's
52:59 communications of the acm and those
53:01 typically have some great summaries that
53:03 will give me pointers to maybe papers in
53:06 journals and conferences that are
53:08 something to pay attention to and then
53:10 i'll watch my favorite conferences in
53:13 the areas of data science and
53:15 parallel computing high performance
53:17 computing and i'll track what's
53:19 happening i'll attend some of those
53:22 conferences
53:24 now you know it's easy being able to
53:26 attend many things virtually and i'll
53:28 scan the agendas and see
53:30 you know what's interesting what are the
53:32 trends and what what catches my eye so i
53:35 just stay on top by trying to follow it
53:38 and again it's it's a lot of fun i i
53:40 have some books that i'd love to read
53:42 but i also like the
53:44 um being able to read these professional
53:48 articles as well
53:51 so you say you prefer to go to your
53:54 favorite conferences so what are those
53:57 i know there is one sick graph right is
54:00 there is there such a conference
54:02 secret sig graph is for computer
54:04 graphics um okay so it's not
54:07 not related to graphs right
54:09 right so that that's more visualization
54:11 and graphics is the top conference in
54:14 that area i'm often doing high
54:16 performance data analytics
54:18 and go to conferences like super
54:20 computing from the ieee and the acm or
54:24 ieee hpac which is high performance
54:27 extreme computing and one of my favorite
54:29 conferences is from the ieee called
54:32 ipdps the international parallel and
54:35 distributed processing symposium that's
54:38 been one of the longest running
54:40 conferences in parallel computing where
54:42 i have my main community there
54:46 and there's other conferences as well
54:49 there's quite a lot that are blossoming
54:51 in the arab data science
54:53 and i'm excited to see where those go as
54:56 well
54:58 and how do you select topics for
54:59 research so you read
55:01 these summary papers and they think okay
55:03 like this is actually i can contribute
55:05 to or how does it work
55:07 so that that's a great question many
55:09 faculty look at an area and say hey what
55:11 could i do in this area i'm probably
55:14 somewhat of an outlier where i first
55:16 want to find a
55:18 person in another discipline who may be
55:21 struggling
55:22 and
55:23 they don't have the computational
55:26 capability or the data science tools
55:28 that they need to solve their problem so
55:30 i first go to finding what's the need
55:33 and then i really
55:35 look at their domain in detail and how
55:38 can i help enable them to solve their
55:41 problem i think that's the way to have
55:43 more impactful research rather than just
55:46 creating something that i love to do
55:48 but maybe nobody else will be interested
55:50 in i always try to think about who needs
55:52 this
55:53 and can i help them earlier in my career
55:56 i worked with geographers
55:58 i worked also with many computational
56:01 biologists and those working on genome
56:04 sciences
56:05 where they had
56:06 data sets and problems that they'd like
56:08 to solve but didn't know how to do it
56:10 they didn't have the algorithms
56:13 they didn't have the right data
56:14 structures where i can help assist them
56:18 and so through the course of my career
56:19 i've repeatedly been able to work with
56:21 domain scientists and help them
56:24 solve the problems that they have and in
56:26 doing so i get to publish some great
56:28 computer and data science papers but
56:30 more importantly i get to solve real
56:32 problems where it makes a difference to
56:35 a
56:36 scientific and technical committee out
56:38 there
56:39 i guess that's the recipe of how to get
56:42 such a long list of credentials like you
56:44 have right so just start with a need
56:46 find somebody who struggles and then
56:50 find out what they struggle with and
56:52 offer them tools right and work together
56:55 that's right you know at the start of my
56:57 career i thought it took longer to do my
56:59 research for instance nasa the space
57:02 agency in the u.s funded my phd
57:05 and
57:06 i had a fellowship and worked on
57:07 problems from nasa on satellite image
57:11 processing
57:12 and i remember working on that problem
57:14 where there are a number of academic
57:16 papers but the academic papers cut
57:18 corners and abstracted away from the
57:20 real problem i want to build a system
57:23 that real nasa scientists would use and
57:26 so it took an extra effort to make sure
57:28 that i was scientifically valid that the
57:31 results were quality checked and
57:33 controlled and that i was solving the
57:35 problem the real problem not just a
57:38 computer science abstraction that i
57:40 could publish a paper on so it took a
57:42 lot more to create the right interfaces
57:44 and to really maintain all the science
57:47 that was in that code and i've had to do
57:49 that multiple times in my career when i
57:51 build systems for biologists or others
57:54 where i really have to make sure that
57:56 it's a system that has all of the corner
57:58 cases all of the complexity that's in
58:00 the real data and the real problem
58:03 rather than just writing a paper that i
58:05 can publish and put on my resume but no
58:07 one will ever use
58:11 and maybe the last question so i
58:13 remember when i was a master student
58:16 when i almost graduated my professor
58:18 called me
58:19 uh to his um to his room and then he
58:23 said okay we're doing this cool research
58:25 how about you join us and work as a phd
58:27 student
58:28 and then i thought okay like the
58:30 salaries aren't not
58:32 that great like um how about i think
58:35 like for a couple of years and work in
58:36 the industry and then i did that and
58:38 then
58:39 you know i didn't come back so like you
58:42 as a professor do you have this problem
58:43 that you need to compete for students
58:46 who are maybe motivated
58:49 not by
58:50 research but things by but by things
58:53 like money and they don't stay
58:56 in academia they don't pursue their phd
58:58 and they just work
59:00 you know on something like
59:03 i don't know running sql queries on and
59:05 calculating click-through rates
59:08 so i
59:09 i
59:11 love
59:12 attracting phd students to this research
59:14 that's why i'm here talking with you and
59:16 i'd encourage anyone who's interested in
59:18 this area to come
59:20 seek me out at njit
59:22 you could do a google search and find us
59:25 and
59:25 i'm looking for some great phd students
59:28 there
59:29 is always a competitive market for phd
59:31 students in research and there's many
59:33 different areas that phd students can
59:35 work on
59:36 and so i've had phd students that do
59:38 their whole research with me others
59:41 work with me for a few years and then
59:43 they may find someone else that their
59:45 research is more exciting and that's
59:47 great for them to find a research topic
59:51 that they can do their dissertation on
59:53 and then become the world expert in so
59:55 i'm always looking for
59:56 fantastic phd students i have a great
59:58 lab it's very diverse
1:00:00 i've men and women and have been able to
1:00:03 graduate quite a number of students
1:00:05 over the the years
1:00:07 i think you know for students there's a
1:00:09 lot of choices to be made especially for
1:00:12 research and that there's probably a
1:00:15 research lab for everybody no matter
1:00:17 what your interest is you'll probably
1:00:19 find a person that is working in that
1:00:22 area so i encourage students to really
1:00:23 look at the professors rather than
1:00:25 looking just at the university name look
1:00:28 at the professors and what research
1:00:29 they're doing and decide do you want to
1:00:31 be an expert in that area and who can
1:00:33 you apprentice with to do your research
1:00:36 and
1:00:37 again
1:00:38 there are many
1:00:40 funded phd positions
1:00:42 that we have students who are typically
1:00:44 supported while they do their phds so
1:00:46 they get a stipend and their tuition
1:00:48 paid so what better way
1:00:50 uh could you do
1:00:52 uh your graduate degree than you know a
1:00:55 funded phd position and come out and be
1:00:57 the expert in your field i've had
1:01:01 my students go on and
1:01:03 mention summer faculty at penn state at
1:01:06 university of florida and other places
1:01:08 and others who are now leaders at
1:01:10 research
1:01:12 at major companies where they're really
1:01:14 the thought leaders
1:01:16 so it's exciting my own i should mention
1:01:19 i was an undergraduate student when i
1:01:22 first did research i got involved as a
1:01:25 undergraduate with a faculty member's
1:01:28 research program during a research
1:01:30 experience for undergraduates and that's
1:01:31 when the bug hit me it was like my gosh
1:01:33 this is so fun i had no idea what
1:01:36 research was until i spent a few summers
1:01:40 working with that faculty member and i'd
1:01:42 encourage all students to think about a
1:01:45 research experience find a faculty
1:01:46 member that you find their work is
1:01:48 interesting and see if you can work in
1:01:50 in their lab i'm sure that they would
1:01:53 love to have you and i think once you
1:01:56 touch research and you see research
1:01:57 maybe it will lead to a lifelong career
1:02:01 and i guess
1:02:03 so the example i gave you like at the
1:02:07 beginning of my professor talking to me
1:02:09 and trying to sort of convince me to
1:02:11 stay like do you need to do this do you
1:02:13 need to compete with industry
1:02:15 or like you don't have this problem
1:02:17 because there are enough motivated
1:02:19 students not necessarily maybe from your
1:02:21 group but coming from elsewhere who want
1:02:23 to join your your group
1:02:25 so that's a great question often our
1:02:27 masters students are with us for about a
1:02:30 year or two and many of them go to
1:02:32 industry a few will continue on for a
1:02:34 phd either at their current institutions
1:02:37 one another but the phd students
1:02:39 typically want to get a phd because
1:02:41 that's the entry level to be a
1:02:43 researcher within some of the top
1:02:46 industries and companies and we work
1:02:48 with many companies that want to recruit
1:02:50 our students but they want them at
1:02:53 particular levels so they may not want
1:02:56 to take the phd students before they're
1:02:58 completed to make sure that they have a
1:03:00 phd versus the master's students are
1:03:04 more readily accessible to industry
1:03:07 so i haven't really had a compete
1:03:09 against industry in fact often we
1:03:11 collaborate with industry finding shared
1:03:13 research topics that our phd students
1:03:15 can do and what better way to train them
1:03:17 so that when they do get their phd they
1:03:19 have a company that's ready to to hire
1:03:22 them and continue that research so it's
1:03:25 really more collaboration at the phd
1:03:27 level than a competition within history
1:03:30 okay makes sense okay like if anyone has
1:03:34 questions and then they want to reach
1:03:36 out to you and ask them what's the best
1:03:37 way to do this
1:03:39 if you find my webpage davidbaiter.net
1:03:42 there's a contact form where anyone can
1:03:45 put in a question comment or ask me and
1:03:48 uh
1:03:49 reply
1:03:50 i guess this is the page where i found
1:03:52 your cv if i'm not mistaken that's right
1:03:55 so you'll you'll find 106 pages if you'd
1:03:57 like to read it along with the
1:03:59 announcements and
1:04:01 uh copies of the papers and other fun
1:04:03 stuff at the website
1:04:05 yeah maybe by the time we release it
1:04:07 will be 107. no
1:04:10 we'll see okay yeah thanks for the chat
1:04:12 uh yeah thanks everyone for
1:04:14 joining us today for asking questions i
1:04:17 didn't cover two questions apologies for
1:04:19 that but i think um
1:04:21 yeah we will
1:04:23 stop now and just want to thank you
1:04:25 again david for
1:04:27 joining us today for sharing your
1:04:29 expertise experience so for me as
1:04:30 somebody who is working in industry this
1:04:32 is an entirely different world
1:04:34 so now i have some ideas how exactly
1:04:36 what you do there in academia and yeah
1:04:39 that was very interesting thank you
1:04:41 thanks alexi great to talk with you and
1:04:43 i hope your listeners really enjoyed the
