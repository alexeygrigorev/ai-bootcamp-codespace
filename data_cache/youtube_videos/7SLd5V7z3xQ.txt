0:00 hi everyone Welcome to our event this
0:02 event is brought to you by data do club
0:04 which is a community of people who love
0:06 data we have weekly events and today's
0:09 one of such events if you want to find
0:11 out more about events we have there is a

0:37 hang out with other data
0:39 interests and speaking of communities so
0:41 this is actually what we will talk today
0:43 so this is a topic that is very close to
0:45 my heart and if you have any
0:48 questions um about that you want to ask
0:52 today there is a pin Link in live chat
0:55 hopefully it works because I had some
0:58 problems with this so yeah use this link
1:03 to ask your questions um I think that's
1:07 all for the
1:09 intro now I will open the questions that
1:13 we
1:16 prepared
1:19 and I'm ready to start are you ready to
1:22 start yeah okay then let's roll
1:27 so this week we'll talk about community
1:30 building and we have a special guest
1:33 today irum irum is a lead machine
1:34 learning engineer and PhD researcher at
1:39 ustus liik University did I pronounce it
1:42 correctly
1:45 yeah so irum spe spe specializes in this
1:51 is very difficult word specializes in AI
1:54 for Education she instructs at woman in
1:57 AI Academy and leads on Academy
2:00 previously she taught deep learning
2:02 internationally and organized data
2:04 science bootcamps and many more things
2:07 you will probably tell us about them so
2:10 thanks for joining us thanks for being
2:12 here
2:14 welcome thank you for having me I'm so
2:18 excited to share yeah whatever I've been
2:22 doing
2:23 yeahh so the questions for today's
2:25 interview are prepared as always by
2:28 Johanna Johanna berer thanks for your
2:30 help and let's start so before we go
2:33 into our main topic of today which is
2:36 community building let's start with your
2:38 background can you tell us about your
2:40 career Journey so
2:42 far yeah so uh I am mam I am from
2:46 Pakistan currently I am based in uh
2:48 Germany as Alex just shared uh I'm doing
2:51 my PhD over here uh how I started so uh
2:56 I basically belong to not so much
3:00 developed area of Pakistan but where
3:03 even women are females are not allowed
3:06 to get
3:07 education but I am the lucky one I got
3:10 education then I moved to city and then
3:12 I
3:13 started working with community and in
3:16 that manner I also been a lucky one that
3:20 instead of joining and learning by
3:23 joining some lessons or lectures so I
3:27 started delivering Workshop s and
3:30 courses which I used to you know learn
3:34 and then I have many
3:36 networks and interestingly through those
3:39 Network I got uh this my research
3:43 position in uh University of gon that
3:46 that is Justice liist University in
3:49 gon uh I was from one of the the
3:53 community I was referred as JY m in one
3:57 of the project in Germany
4:00 I was during the project and this
4:02 University Applied uh the project was
4:05 selected and then uh I uh I was
4:09 mentoring that project and then I
4:11 offered them it is really a good project
4:14 why should not start and offer a PhD
4:17 position on that and they gladly like
4:21 gladly accepted that and then they
4:23 offered me why don't you send anyone on
4:26 that position and I thought why not I
4:29 should join so that's how I'm here today
4:34 mhm which city are you Bas in I am in
4:38 Geon it's nearby Frankfurt aha okay so
4:42 the big Frankfurt right Frankfurt M yeah
4:46 okay yeah I have never been to to that
4:49 frankort so you should visit sometime
4:52 yeah okay yeah and um so you work at
4:58 Oma and you what's your title
5:02 there so currently I am head of omina
5:05 Academy but I started as lead uh machine
5:09 learning engineer and then um we started
5:13 delivering courses and then um we
5:17 started with omina school which we just
5:20 changed as omina
5:22 Academy So currently I am head of om
5:26 Academy okay and it's amazing like I'm
5:29 sorry to hear here uh that in the area
5:32 where you grew up that women cannot get
5:35 education and it's a very lucky
5:39 situation that you managed to do this
5:41 hopefully the situation
5:43 changes and uh yeah Lu we speak here cuz
5:47 you got the education
5:48 you went through all the things you said
5:52 and yeah I'm really interested to learn
5:55 more about
5:56 Amna what Amna is doing in general and
6:00 what you specifically do
6:03 there so omina is uh also a global
6:07 Community it started back in
6:10 209 and um I am one of the collaborators
6:14 so we call every participant as a
6:16 collaborator so it works like you have a
6:19 real word challenge and collaborator
6:22 around the world solve that uh problem
6:24 with uh the help of AI so we started
6:28 like uh
6:30 building a mental uh assess assestive
6:33 application in 2019 then finding en
6:37 norly uh on the surface of Mars and
6:40 figuring out if life is possible or not
6:42 something like that but the major
6:44 learning is you are not who is working
6:48 from one country or from one educational
6:52 social uh background so there is like
6:56 there are a group of people 50 60 people
7:00 from different uh background age
7:03 qualification and you learn together so
7:06 initially it comes up to you like this
7:08 is the project and you have to solve
7:11 like the bottom of uh problem uh
7:14 solution of the problem so that is how
7:17 Oma started and it was really great
7:20 learning platform firstly you learn by
7:24 doing and that is the real word data set
7:27 which is very rear in AI project and the
7:31 second thing is you have a people from
7:34 diverse background and you network them
7:37 you learn how how they are dealing with
7:40 the situation and they support you like
7:42 you want to do something they refer you
7:44 resources they help you out so uh this
7:47 is how omina
7:50 Works what I do there So eventually we
7:53 started from this like very first
7:56 project I was working as a collaborator
7:59 then I joined omina on and off like I've
8:01 been starting we started building like
8:03 the
8:04 graphic I had a bit of experience in
8:07 graphics so I started building
8:09 certificates then um we thought we
8:13 should have like because Ai and data
8:16 science courses are very expensive and
8:18 Out Of Reach of underdeveloping
8:21 community so why not to build courses
8:24 from these project which we are doing
8:26 with real world and that could be like a
8:29 capacity building for the collaborator
8:31 for example if I want to be a teacher I
8:35 can teach to these people fee of cost H
8:38 it will be it will be helping them in
8:40 learning and it will be helping them to
8:42 be a good instructor so we started this
8:45 program like the people from that
8:48 project can deliver the course and
8:51 anyone without any you know geographical
8:55 boundaries or financial boundaries they
8:57 can join the course and at omina we we
9:01 were providing them uh like the platform
9:04 for instructor and student and once they
9:08 do the project then they can uh do the
9:11 course they can be part of omina
9:13 projects because with the passage of
9:16 time competency level is increasing like
9:19 there are thousand applications and we
9:21 need only 60 people for one project and
9:24 everyone want to join so this was also
9:27 helping us out like we are training
9:29 people they already know the process and
9:31 they can join um
9:34 on uh itself as a collaborator for
9:39 projects so was it more driven by
9:42 necessity that uh you saw that then when
9:45 people join projects by Amina you saw
9:48 that um more often than not some of the
9:51 participants collaborators lacked some
9:54 skills so I thought how about we create
9:56 a course so they go through the course
9:58 and when they join the course they
10:00 already have the B know the basics or it
10:03 was more the demand from um the students
10:06 or collaborators who said okay like we
10:09 we want to take part but we're
10:11 struggling with this areas so we want to
10:13 have a course about this before we
10:15 continue or maybe
10:17 both so basically it's not like 100%
10:21 aligned uh with with the requirement uh
10:25 it no doubt addresses those like the
10:28 skill set which are which is required
10:30 for for the projects as well but we
10:32 deliver the course after completion of
10:34 project so it is not directly linked
10:36 with the project itself so it is just
10:39 like uh you know we have done one
10:42 project uh at omina and uh we want to
10:47 teach how Amina works so people would
10:50 able to learn in that way so it is for
10:53 them learning and then they have an idea
10:55 how to do projects in nomina so it
10:58 somehow link with the upcoming project
11:02 but not 100% whatever they have learned
11:04 they will replicate their learning
11:07 so it's not it's just parallel not
11:11 like yeah what kind of so from what I
11:14 understood from you it was more about
11:16 like the platform and the community like
11:19 how exactly you learn how exactly you
11:20 interact with people did I understand it
11:23 right or there your courses like the
11:26 basics of data science I don't know
11:28 pandas in n intro things like
11:32 that there are like uh there are now
11:35 courses on that as well because uh when
11:38 we were growing we started it in 2021
11:41 and it's been more than three years so
11:43 we have started these basic courses but
11:45 initially it was not like that it was
11:47 like uh uh developing uh a computer wi
11:53 solution for uh VN impair impaired
11:57 people in Germany so that was a project
12:00 uh people did that and then we developed
12:02 a course on that like how people who is
12:06 uh how they can detect
12:09 Transportation uh if they are visually
12:11 impair impaired and then there were like
12:14 the courses on um natural language
12:17 processing how to prepare students for
12:20 interviews and uh uh assessing their
12:24 abilities where they can do better so
12:26 courses like that are there then there
12:28 were like
12:29 uh agricultural uh reform through AI so
12:33 it was not like just the basic
12:36 introduction to computer science but
12:38 eventually then organization started
12:41 reaching out them like uh Bhutan
12:43 government we are delivering courses
12:44 through Bhutan government and they
12:47 started asking us like developing a
12:50 course a structure course then we have
12:52 to you know start with uh we have our
12:55 foundational data science gos and um
12:59 where we teach like introduction to
13:01 these all skill set like pandas Python
13:04 and then bringing them independently to
13:08 a AI
13:11 project so maybe I so my impression from
13:16 talking to you was that the courses so
13:19 so when you said the courses usually
13:20 started after the projects was it
13:23 something you learned from the project
13:25 and then you tried to teach so it's like
13:28 uh okay okay now I learned I seem to
13:30 understand this but how can I understand
13:33 it even better yes you can do this by
13:36 teaching so how about you just teach
13:38 what you just learned was it the idea
13:41 yeah exactly you you are right it's it's
13:43 just like that MH no that's
13:47 awesome yeah because that's like the
13:50 best way to learn something is actually
13:52 because like at the beginning you think
13:53 okay I think I get it but then you start
13:56 when somebody asks you to explain you
13:59 start seeing the gaps in your
14:01 understanding right and then when you go
14:04 back and try to fill these gaps to
14:07 understand them and the best way of
14:08 doing is actually coming up with a like
14:11 structural structured content like a
14:13 course and then like you will quickly
14:16 see all the gaps and that was the idea
14:19 right yes exactly that that was the idea
14:23 mhm and H how do you decide what kind of
14:27 content to teach or what to talk
14:29 what what to what kind of courses to
14:31 create so basically I was again I I've
14:36 been working and still working as a
14:38 facilitator I also teach few courses and
14:41 uh if I decide how how should I teach
14:44 the course so
14:45 basically uh I have degree in computer
14:49 science and I want to learn something
14:51 new so instead of going taking paid
14:54 courses I started learning and then make
14:56 notes and then I delivered the course so
14:58 otherwise the content content is just
14:59 with me I'm not doing anything with the
15:02 content so I prepare course on that and
15:05 deliver it and when I'm delivering I'm
15:07 learning okay I have to solve it because
15:09 I have to teach it that's how I learn
15:12 but uh for the people how as a platform
15:15 we are using is that uh people we have a
15:19 web page for registration so
15:21 collaborator from the projects apply for
15:24 instructor and then we review their
15:27 content and uh their course outline and
15:30 then after having a few session on how
15:34 we can change it how it could be like
15:37 more realistic so then we we create a
15:40 page and start normal course U that's
15:43 how it like it depends upon the person
15:46 who want to deliver a course MH and the
15:50 courses are free right aren't they yeah
15:53 free free for both actually for
15:55 instructor and student as well so you're
15:58 not getting anything if you are teaching
16:02 MH this is how it works too at data do
16:05 Club so the courses are free for
16:07 everyone also including the
16:09 instructors so yeah but um there's also
16:13 a beauty in that like when the course is
16:16 free like the reach is
16:18 wider so you can reach places and people
16:22 you wouldn't be able to reach with a
16:23 paid course and this is this is amazing
16:26 right true that and that that like I
16:29 always talk to my CEO like we should
16:31 keep it sell them and he always says
16:34 education is something we Cann not ear
16:37 and we should not charge to the students
16:40 like we are charging to the
16:42 organizations because they are already
16:45 self
16:46 sustained uh but student we don't charge
16:50 and uh it's it's free of cost for them
16:54 uh to
16:55 learn and you mentioned organization
16:57 this is um so you talk about you talked
17:00 earlier about that when an an
17:03 organization approaches you and says
17:05 look you have this foundational data
17:07 science course and we want this
17:09 course we want you to teach this course
17:12 at our company can you come and do that
17:15 and you said yes but like it will not be
17:17 free right yeah that's how we work uhuh
17:22 that's the that's the the business model
17:24 true uhhuh interesting and uh like they
17:28 I have to be in the AM Community to join
17:32 the
17:34 course like do I have to do a project
17:36 first for
17:38 example no for for the organization who
17:41 wants just courses it is just like we
17:43 develop courses for them from omina
17:46 platform and uh like every uh uh what we
17:50 can say organizational stuff is taken
17:52 care by omina and from omina academy uh
17:56 my our responsibility is uh developing
17:59 curriculum and content and stuff like
18:02 that so they don't need to necessarily
18:04 to do the project with company it goes
18:07 other ways around so they do the course
18:09 and then The Graduate have to do those
18:12 projects so then it's like that we do
18:15 course first with organization and then
18:18 we offer like sometime we have open we
18:20 open local chapter in that country and
18:23 whoever is graduated we ask them let's
18:26 do this project and then mhm like it's a
18:30 not a bottom of approach mhm it's
18:33 interesting my original question was a
18:35 little bit different but what you said
18:37 is um so let's say there's country I
18:40 know let's say Kenya right and there is
18:43 an organization that want to have
18:45 courses there they don't have a project
18:48 yet you first do a course with them you
18:51 upskill the people in this organization
18:53 and then once they understand the let's
18:55 say the basics of data science then it's
18:57 easier for you to say
18:59 okay like looks like you have some
19:00 problems that we can help you address
19:03 let's make a project right and then the
19:06 students who created from that course
19:09 can already do the
19:12 project yeah that that's how it works so
19:15 we sometime they give us the problem
19:17 sometime we also Define this is the
19:19 problem in this region let's solve this
19:22 and we have already capacity and the
19:25 people who have graduated can join and
19:27 anyone else from outside is also welcome
19:32 mhm yeah my original question was
19:34 actually for the students so let's say
19:36 if I'm a student I have not heard about
19:38 omina yet I have not done any project
19:41 with omina yet but I come across a
19:44 course that is interesting for me let's
19:46 say this foundational data science and I
19:50 think this is I want to take this course
19:53 can I do this or I need to First do a
19:55 project with MD or somehow be associated
19:58 with
19:59 the community or I know have a friend
20:01 invite me or something like that oh
20:03 sorry I did not I I I could not
20:06 understand yeah I got your question now
20:08 yes uh basically to join a course you
20:12 don't need to be part of fora but to
20:15 deliver a course you need to be part of
20:17 omina community uh so to anyone can join
20:21 omina course but once you graduated you
20:25 become part of om community and then you
20:27 can join any project of few chice
20:31 mhm and like I'm curious how does it
20:35 usually happen do
20:37 people um just come to you and say hey I
20:40 want to be an instructor or you have to
20:42 proactively look for instructors for
20:45 certain topics or maybe it's a mixture
20:48 so it's a mixture like uh we have a like
20:53 the link is open every single time
20:56 anyone can uh up apply for instructor at
20:59 any time uh sometime we have like
21:03 sometime there is the demand of new
21:05 topic and people are asking and there is
21:08 interesting project may be going on so
21:10 then uh uh we also reach out like this
21:14 project is very interesting and then I
21:17 asked project team who is active and who
21:20 would be willing to deliver the course
21:22 why not to make a course on this x uh
21:26 Challenger project so it's also works in
21:29 two
21:30 ways
21:32 mhm
21:33 okay uh like we in data talks club we
21:38 also have free courses I mentioned that
21:41 and one of the courses just ended today
21:44 for this course it was a data
21:46 engineering course and we have 25,000
21:49 registrations
21:51 signups and 350 roughly people graduated
21:56 which means that the completion rate is
21:58 is slightly above 1% it's
22:02 1.4% people who like between who applied
22:06 who signed up and actually ended up with
22:09 certificate the course is tough yes so I
22:11 understand that there's some sort of
22:13 natural selection but also when a course
22:15 is free it doesn't cost you anything to
22:17 just sign up and not show not show up at
22:20 the
22:22 end do you see something similar with
22:25 the completion rates of your courses
22:29 yeah true true that we we are trying to
22:32 engage more people and trying some uh
22:34 engagement uh activities as well so same
22:38 it with us so our courses are not
22:40 recorded those are live courses and we
22:43 also have like for 500 registration but
22:46 eventually we only invite 100 people
22:49 because we have zoom capacity and also
22:51 so financially we have uh have uh like
22:55 uh capacity of delivering free course to
22:57 100 students
23:00 and graduation rate is 33% and
23:03 graduation mean like it used to be most
23:06 of the time 50 student or 60 student
23:09 from 100 are always active they are
23:11 joining courses and stuff like that but
23:13 they are not able to do the project like
23:16 the competency or difficulty level is
23:18 may be little high or they are not
23:20 submitting assignments so uh for
23:24 graduation criteria we have like they
23:27 have to submit final project project and
23:29 assessments if they don't do that they
23:31 will not get certificate like they are
23:32 not getting certificate of
23:34 participation so there are people who
23:37 are attending throughout but are not
23:39 doing project so it is like 30% on on
23:44 average we can say we our graduation
23:46 rate is
23:47 30% MH this is quite cool so what you do
23:51 is also so in our case this is just
23:54 natural selection so people who not
23:57 motivated or who don't have time or who
24:01 have difficulties they naturally drop
24:04 out in your case you do some
24:06 pre-screening right so you have 500
24:08 applications but only 100 can join the
24:11 course right what kind of criteria
24:14 criteria do you use if it's not a secret
24:16 to to we we have uh basically we have
24:20 criteria for for the course there are
24:23 prerequisite and there is motivation and
24:25 then we always have one question how
24:28 many hour you can spend uh one week or
24:31 uh you have to uh to continue the course
24:35 so this really helps us a lot like uh
24:39 how to to do that and after completion
24:41 they get a free subscription to other
24:44 learning platform as well uh I don't I
24:46 think you don't mind like data camp or
24:48 other we have collaboration so we give
24:51 voucher free Watcher to them as well so
24:53 this also motivate them so they write in
24:57 in that motivation so if like someone my
25:00 friend is graduated so I will refer yeah
25:02 I got this from after completing this
25:05 course and then they put a little bit
25:07 effort uh for selection yeah I we take
25:12 motivation uh elig like prerequisite if
25:15 they know and uh time they can
25:21 spend yeah yeah makes sense and um so I
25:25 was asking it's it was already like like
25:29 almost half an hour we were talking
25:30 about teaching and courses and I was
25:33 thinking like wait the topic is actually
25:35 community building right why do we talk
25:37 about teaching and we spend so much time
25:39 but this is quite related right cuz like
25:42 when you
25:43 teach when you do projects when you do
25:45 all these kind of things you form a
25:48 community and then people who took part
25:51 in projects who maybe learned from
25:54 other courses from you they start
25:58 feeling motivated and empowered to also
26:01 at some point
26:02 teach and the process of like when you
26:07 join you don't know if you
26:10 can teach something and then to the
26:13 point when you learned enough from the
26:15 projects and you feel like okay now I
26:17 want to give back like this is quite a a
26:21 process to go there right and the
26:23 community can make this happen right and
26:29 um yeah so I'm curious like how do you
26:32 see the connection between teaching and
26:34 creating and maintaining
26:39 community so like creating omina
26:42 Community there is like I don't have uh
26:45 much role over there Frankly Speaking
26:48 because there are other people who work
26:51 really really on we have Community
26:53 manager and there are other perspective
26:55 as well so I am doing a very small uh
26:58 pers perspective that is
26:59 teaching uh for me I have yeah very
27:04 small so maybe fora yes like you know we
27:11 as a person I have been involved in
27:13 various Community because uh this I I
27:18 have experienced this helps you really
27:21 well uh I am learning I have to learn I
27:24 have to get a job and I am frustrated in
27:27 my room with lot of content I cannot do
27:29 anything and when I go and meet the
27:33 people even attending a workshop so I
27:35 I'm able to see yeah there are people
27:39 and then they you share your frustration
27:41 as well like it is it is not only
27:44 learning it is the other perspective of
27:46 learning as well so I have been part of
27:50 the community like woman who Cod
27:52 unfortunately it has just disolve but it
27:55 was also really really a big learning
27:57 community
27:59 and then I I've been part I'm still part
28:02 of neurom match Academy that is also
28:04 really amazing Community to teach uh Ai
28:07 and data science courses and you meet
28:10 the people around the world and then you
28:12 know you feel
28:15 like how is it for everyone instead of
28:19 you know you are sitting here and then
28:21 you are learning and you you have
28:23 ultimately stress in your
28:25 mind like you have to complete that and
28:28 there is no motivation but when you meet
28:31 the people and do the things maybe most
28:34 of the time they are just you know
28:36 giving you overall view you have to
28:39 do uh practical by yourself in your free
28:43 time but at least you got an overview
28:45 and you meet the people so for me it is
28:50 really important uh perspective for for
28:54 the people who are just like new in
28:57 their career are just graduating because
29:00 that is the point they need a
29:03 communication skill they need to know uh
29:07 outside like from their own uh thinking
29:11 shell so yeah that that's how I I take
29:15 it as like how it could be beneficial MH
29:21 and as I understood you took some
29:23 leading roles within this community like
29:25 women women who cot neurom Magic
29:28 uh also at Amina and I'm wondering like
29:32 what motivated you
29:34 cuz this is not a paid job right so you
29:38 just thought okay I want to do this and
29:41 you felt empowered to do that and you
29:44 did it right so what what motivated
29:47 you so for omina I joined it like I got
29:51 uh they were building something so I got
29:53 some post from Facebook and then uh I
29:56 connected them and they launched the
29:58 project I joined that and then I meet
30:01 many people in in the community so one
30:03 of my she's really good friend anju
30:06 she's also she was also lead so she
30:09 invited me to deliver a workshop in uh
30:14 woman who could I delivered the workshop
30:17 and then I met few then I guess they
30:20 were a conference and I had few uh uh
30:24 voluntarily role on maybe evaluation of
30:27 something and they offered me we have
30:29 opening for leadership team and you need
30:32 10 hour per month uh to organize such
30:37 events if it's okay for you and then I
30:39 took that so it was like not I wanted to
30:43 join this it was like I used to meet
30:45 people and they refer me and then I take
30:48 like why not uh so I wanted to connect
30:51 it with the people so that was you know
30:53 the best way to be in touch with them
30:56 yeah mhm so the motivation was kind of
31:00 gradual so at the beginning you were
31:02 part of the community you met people you
31:05 networked and then as you built your
31:08 network more and more opportunities
31:10 appeared and in these
31:13 communities they had some sort of I
31:16 guess Frameworks maybe for people who
31:17 are motivated who want to do something
31:20 to tell them okay look we need help with
31:22 that can you give us at least 10 hours
31:26 of your time per per month to do this
31:29 and you thought okay yes I can do that
31:32 and then this way you continued
31:35 networking and maybe met more people
31:38 right do that yeah it's it's just like
31:41 that MH okay CU like one of the reasons
31:45 this question is interesting to me
31:47 personally as a community manager
31:50 myself I want feel I want to make
31:54 people I want to how to say like I want
31:59 people feel empowered to actually go
32:02 ahead and do things feel motivated to do
32:06 things like start a project or uh I
32:11 don't know start a
32:13 local meetup group or something like
32:16 that and I'm wondering how to create
32:19 such an environment where
32:21 people just feel like okay I can do this
32:24 and go ahead and do that without um
32:26 thinking yeah maybe I should UND do cuz
32:30 I I know that there there are
32:31 communities and I was a part of such
32:33 Community called open data science where
32:36 people would just like it was a very
32:38 decentralized community and people would
32:40 just like okay let's start the chapter
32:42 in Berlin let's just meet
32:44 regularly right and so people felt
32:46 empowered to do that and I'm wondering
32:48 if you have an opinion about that how to
32:51 make Community such friendly Community
32:55 such an empowering Community motivating
32:57 community that people would just take
32:59 leading
33:02 roles yeah that there uh basically with
33:06 that we also buil another uh uh
33:09 Community a small community that is just
33:11 a woman AI Wonder Girl and it was just
33:15 like we belonging from different
33:19 Community girls just make made a group
33:22 initially we were just eight seven girls
33:25 and now it's 100 plus so
33:28 it was just like that we have om
33:30 Community most of of us working there we
33:33 have women who code we are working there
33:36 woman AI uh then uh like such data
33:40 science community so we used to meet
33:43 online because during during Co it was
33:45 possible only online and then you know
33:47 making small groups let's do that and
33:50 meet every week or every month to do
33:52 something and we won really the three
33:54 good project that was and uh we uh with
33:58 woman a one what is that a Wonder Girl
34:03 we have one three project as well and it
34:06 was just like as you are mentioning
34:08 meeting and then motivating ourselves
34:11 let's do this meet every week and
34:14 discuss new topics what is new in AI
34:17 what is new in maybe generative AI model
34:21 or something like that and uh we used to
34:24 have subject expert as well like a a
34:27 person from
34:29 ethical uh background or social science
34:32 background who give a clear in
34:35 lightening like it is not just you will
34:38 Implement Ai and there are no ethical
34:41 boundaries and stuff like that so it it
34:45 helps you uh when you start take such
34:51 initiative and I always am afraid of
34:54 taking you know big initiative like I
34:57 will start a community today and then uh
35:01 in in a week time I will have a big
35:04 Workshop of 500 atts no it is not
35:07 possible so we always have to start
35:09 gradually let's start meeting discuss
35:12 few topic then having you know just
35:16 exploring a model and then you know
35:19 presenting this so it is not like
35:22 starting from a big aim and then you are
35:25 not able to achieve so my recommendation
35:28 is let's start with very very small
35:30 thing that is
35:32 doable like a small uh WhatsApp group
35:37 yeah mhm cuz you were talking about this
35:41 AI Wonder Girls and I I was thinking
35:43 like such a great name and then I
35:45 remember that uh a few months ago we had
35:48 an interview with Sarah who I think
35:51 she's a a CO co-founder of that
35:53 Community right yeah she's really good
35:55 friend yeah yeah
35:58 uh and yeah and in that interview so the
36:01 interview was called make an impact
36:03 through volunteering in open
36:05 source um I think it was a few months
36:08 back where she talked about the group
36:11 and how
36:13 you won a few hackaton right yeah that's
36:17 what I'm talking about yeah yeah that's
36:20 cool yeah for those who are listening
36:22 and have not listened to that
36:24 episode I think yeah it was uh maybe
36:27 like six seven episodes ago maybe a
36:30 little bit more but um yeah check it out
36:32 it was also an interesting chat yeah I
36:35 will I I will check it out thank you
36:38 okay um so for me personally I am a big
36:43 fan of communities and I was a big fan
36:45 of communities even before data talks
36:47 Club started and the reason for that is
36:51 it helped me a lot with my career so
36:55 when I started learning Java when I
36:57 became a Java developer the first thing
36:59 I did was joining a Java Community or
37:02 later when I was um into data science
37:06 what I did I found the data science
37:08 community and joined the data science
37:10 community and I did that for for many
37:12 other things like for hobes to and I'm
37:15 wondering I'm really curious to know
37:17 your opinion like what do you think how
37:19 important communities is for
37:25 career yeah so again again it sometime
37:29 it depends upon individual as well like
37:32 personally I I'm really big fan of the
37:35 community for career building as you are
37:37 saying I always prefer to join if I am
37:41 learning something so I have joined like
37:44 apple developer
37:45 Community uh Google Community although
37:47 it's a big Community my role is nothing
37:49 but you know just having newsletter and
37:53 getting update gives you an overall
37:56 update instead you go there read the
37:59 whole book and then you got an idea so
38:02 uh for career building I guess it is
38:05 very very important because uh you know
38:08 you already have
38:11 your you have graduated from your
38:14 college or university so now you have to
38:17 figure out what path I should
38:21 choose I am a computer science graduate
38:24 and there are plenty of job
38:26 opportunities in computer science domain
38:29 so now I need to find what is demand in
38:33 society what what are the topics people
38:36 talking about what is the need of
38:38 technology so that I would able to learn
38:40 those skill set so you learn this from
38:42 Community I guess you go to the
38:44 communities you are part of that and
38:47 then it gives you an idea what is need
38:51 what skill set is needed and then you
38:54 develop those skill set and for
38:56 development just start teaching just
38:59 start building your own community and
39:01 make a group and learn together this
39:04 helped you a lot I I guess this this is
39:07 the first track of
39:12 learning and I'm wondering like again
39:15 you mentioned that build your own
39:16 community so usually this probably
39:18 happens when uh there is a larger
39:20 community and there are people in this
39:23 community and they can just say okay
39:26 like look we all live in Berlin how
39:28 about just meeting here for coffee like
39:32 every 2 3 weeks right something like
39:34 that like how do you think communities
39:39 should make it
39:40 possible so these things appear so these
39:43 little sub communities happen so people
39:46 feel empowered to just say let's create
39:48 a WhatsApp group where we can hang out
39:50 and everyone from the bigger Community
39:52 if you're interested in this specific
39:53 topic like I don't know this hackaton or
39:56 this thing just
39:59 join yeah that that's very interesting
40:01 so for example I as individual probably
40:04 nobody know me but when I say I am from
40:08 data talk Club will we are meeting in
40:12 Frankfurt on this day so you know the
40:15 people data that has authenticity they
40:19 will come and listen to me so my uh
40:23 thought on that is like as as as a
40:26 bigger organization we should support
40:28 them in yeah I totally understand if
40:33 someone is using your name they
40:35 should be in ethical values and they
40:38 should present the content what what
40:41 aligns with your agendas but this will
40:44 uh really help a person as empowered
40:48 because individually I cannot go and
40:50 talk at any place but when I am
40:53 representing X Community or any name so
40:57 people recognize them they are not able
41:00 to reach out to the bigger community
41:02 directly so they prefer like yeah this
41:05 is om's International Community let's do
41:08 with frankfor chapter because they are
41:11 doing the same thing and assessible and
41:14 as a local I can physically attend the
41:16 event so WhatsApp group I am not that
41:21 much fan in that perspective because it
41:23 is again your just a personal uh like re
41:28 you you are not you will not able to
41:31 talk to many people so maybe a public
41:36 page or any other social network where
41:40 uh people from same region can join uh
41:44 uh this this group representing maybe
41:48 like any any uh bigger Community mhm so
41:53 maybe now I should make a plug so if
41:56 anyone wants to start the local chapter
41:58 of data do Club please don't feel that
42:02 you have to ask me just do it right and
42:05 then we have like all the stock channels
42:08 and if there is for your geographical
42:11 area if the stock channel is missing
42:13 like everyone in our slack can just go
42:15 and create a
42:16 channel because sometimes people ask can
42:18 I create this Channel or that channel
42:21 you can yeah you just go and create yeah
42:24 and use the name and then have of course
42:27 yeah and then you have more reachability
42:29 literally it it make you more
42:32 authenticated
42:34 mhm um do you have any other tips for
42:38 good Community
42:40 Management so far uh I'm not again a
42:44 community manager person I have a very
42:47 small role being a part of many
42:50 communities so yeah for me the most
42:54 thing is uh engagement and and you know
42:59 giving the value like for example if I
43:03 will always see if I am joining a
43:06 community and spending my time what I
43:09 will get after spending maybe 1 hour or
43:13 two hour in a week uh so
43:17 uh
43:18 like takeway would be like giving a
43:22 clear path what are the values of
43:26 attending and being part of
43:28 community and uh people stay connected
43:32 when they have always like we are human
43:34 we always see the benefit not you know
43:37 sitting and listening anyone for one
43:39 hour what what will I get after after
43:43 attending that so if we Define maybe
43:46 some smaller takeaway like not maybe 3
43:50 months goal maybe just uh after
43:53 attending one session what will be my
43:56 takeup way or what we can deliver a
43:59 person who is
44:00 joining any of our activity maybe a Talk
44:04 podcast or school or Workshop so mhm
44:09 that's great like I never never thought
44:11 about that like usually we just hey hey
44:14 let's meet for a coffee without like
44:17 specifying what actually people will get
44:19 and maybe like if now I think like if
44:23 I'm a person I have I don't know maybe
44:26 univers
44:28 work uh friends and I'm also tired I'm
44:32 lying on a sofa right now open my slack
44:35 and see there is a community meet up
44:39 today ah I'll just watch
44:41 Netflix right so how to yeah compete
44:45 with Netflix how do I show the value
44:49 that people okay Netflix can wait cuz I
44:53 can just go back from that and watch
44:56 this it's all recorded right but the
44:59 meet up is not recorded right so I'll
45:02 miss out like how to to do that yeah
45:05 that's interesting yeah so for me if I
45:08 will I have to um maybe invite someone
45:12 where I I am present so I will always
45:15 say yeah let's uh meet and discuss this
45:21 topic after that maybe we we we find out
45:24 like uh as a person and I think working
45:28 with many individual we always think
45:30 about the result so if we
45:33 always uh advertise this let's meet and
45:37 figure out this like when you have the
45:40 conclusion you don't know the 100 person
45:43 but we are trying so we are meeting
45:46 today and we are figuring out uh the
45:49 data science
45:51 job or maybe skill set required for job
45:55 or maybe how to implement
45:57 how to implement data science model uh
46:00 through web services or streamlet so I
46:03 know already how to build machine
46:05 learning model but I don't know how to
46:06 Showcase machine learning model to
46:08 non-technical person so this will also
46:10 trigger me okay let's see how to deploy
46:13 it in streamlet and I'm free so I will
46:17 get this so I think when we'll have a
46:22 clear takeaway this might trigger more
46:26 people
46:28 yeah that's very useful do you have any
46:30 other
46:32 tips yeah that that's the for most and
46:35 other thing is that like uh we are as a
46:39 community we are developing we are
46:41 offering so many things and uh we just
46:45 need to maybe a bit of uh C categorize
46:50 like this is for basic level this is
46:54 intermediate level skill set this is
46:57 advanced level and what is the
47:00 application something like as again I go
47:03 for always
47:05 uh making the cluster based
47:09 upon uh so that it would be easier data
47:13 science machine learning AI is quite a v
47:16 domain so if we have you know the
47:20 themes and uh uh what we can
47:24 say specific areas then
47:28 it it is easy to reach out and for the
47:30 people as well instead if I I join and
47:33 after half hour I see it is not relevant
47:35 to
47:36 me I should able to know okay this is
47:40 the activity and this could help me uh
47:44 because it is clearly the message is
47:46 clearly mentioned MH yeah thank you so
47:50 we have a few questions that I want to
47:53 cover from the
47:55 community um
47:58 and I don't think I will be able to
48:01 pronounce the name sorry
48:03 joao so there is a with a wave I don't
48:07 know how to to pronounce it it's
48:10 probably Portuguese anyways sorry so the
48:13 question is do you feel that the market
48:14 is saturated with data scientists and ml
48:19 Engineers I don't think so like uh that
48:23 is very funny thing uh few days back uh
48:26 husband my friend we are in same group
48:28 so he he is German they are living in
48:30 Austria so he shared a message uh I'm
48:35 from Pakistan so he was he was sharing
48:37 message uh Germany is looking for more
48:40 it people or there is like lack in IT
48:44 jobs and I was discussing there are many
48:47 people I know they are not getting jobs
48:49 so it is not there is a shortage of
48:53 Market actually there is a shortage of
48:57 uh
48:58 uniqueness like for data science and
49:01 machine learning everyone know that but
49:03 when you apply you always have a huge
49:06 competition so you need to have show
49:09 yourself really a unique uh maybe
49:12 application of that and you need to
49:15 think about about it like there areund
49:18 of machine learning engineer how you
49:21 distinguish yourself so if you acquire
49:24 that one skill set I I think you you are
49:29 increasing your value then there are
49:31 thousand jobs and you are the only one
49:34 who have that skill so uh it it will
49:37 make you more unique so I think there
49:39 are many jobs still available we need to
49:42 figure out how to make it more
49:45 applicable not you know chat GPT code or
49:50 C copying
49:53 project yeah interestingly that you
49:56 mentioned that like there is on one hand
49:58 there is lack of jobs lack of people who
50:02 want to um like companies need it people
50:06 right so companies need data scientist
50:08 on the other hand there are so many
50:11 people who can't find a job and this
50:13 just doesn't this is just strange right
50:16 so there is shortage and there is also a
50:18 lot of people who can't find a job and
50:21 just yesterday we had a meet up in
50:24 Berlin and one of the uh people who
50:27 joined said that he has problems finding
50:30 a job and he has an amazing CV like he
50:34 has a really good CV um he has
50:37 experience
50:38 yet like he have some problems finding a
50:42 job and yeah so for me it's always okay
50:45 like where's this shortage if there are
50:48 so if there are people who are trying to
50:50 find a job and cannot just find it
50:53 immediately right this is strange we are
50:56 well I I will just conclude we are
50:58 actually going for shortcut as well I'm
51:01 also like sometime few of my friends
51:03 have company I help them in evaluating
51:06 the resume or test so when you pass
51:09 those test those are prized like you
51:13 know how can a PL a company hire you
51:17 when you are copying something from
51:18 somewhere so we know that we know the
51:22 code but we don't feel like typing it
51:24 and doing a the project or test
51:26 ourselves so I I think the more we have
51:31 access to to the resources the more it
51:35 had we we have become lazy MH yeah with
51:40 I'm So La now
51:42 yeah but this is such an awesome tool I
51:45 mean I'm lazy by nature and now I can
51:49 use Char PT to be even
51:51 Lazer maybe it's not but you cannot you
51:54 cannot earn by you know with with the
51:57 chat GP it is just helping you out and
52:01 then ultimately you have to work out
52:02 like use it with smartly like don't copy
52:06 just take it as
52:10 facilitator another question so we
52:13 talked about mdina school and you
52:16 mentioned that it's possible to become
52:17 an
52:18 instructor if somebody wants to become
52:21 an instructor how
52:23 to find more information about this
52:27 we have actually uh a web page omina
52:30 academy.com they can apply over there
52:33 and then how spell it uh I can maybe if
52:37 I just Google
52:40 Om yeah oh if I
52:43 Google yeah yeah if I Google Amina
52:46 Academy yeah then the first thing I find
52:49 is amd.com
52:52 Amina Academy yeah apply as a student
52:55 apply as an instructor
52:57 yes okay yeah so here you go this is how
53:00 you find it so for me it was the first
53:02 link I am sure that probably for you it
53:05 will be also the first link in Google
53:10 okay and another
53:13 question what can you recommend to a
53:16 freelancer to start teaching in AI is it
53:19 possible to apply to
53:22 omina so for omina I will again say it
53:26 is
53:27 like we had initially uh the capacity
53:32 building for the collaborator who have
53:34 already done the project because our
53:36 focus is teaching through that project
53:38 so if you have not gone through the
53:40 project we need to first train you how
53:43 the project work and then you know
53:46 hiring you so I would recommend join
53:49 omina projects that is also free join
53:52 any Innovation Challenge or challenges
53:55 learn the process and then come for
53:57 teaching and again most of the time
54:00 teaching is volunteer because we are
54:03 delivering free courses there are few
54:05 paid courses as well uh but those are
54:08 very less mostly it's the free course
54:12 but it really helped you you have a good
54:15 structure then you can um uh sell this
54:18 course at uh other platform like corera
54:22 and uh Udi you can U sell that course
54:27 mhm okay so there's another question is
54:31 if you know about any
54:34 resources uh that help women to have
54:38 access to education on AI and if they
54:43 want to learn more about how AI can help
54:48 them so
54:50 uh uh I would again recommend there are
54:54 like uh for for women or for anyone is
54:57 to join AI communities there are always
55:01 courses then you can
55:03 join if you want to learn there are
55:06 basic machine learning courses at Kera
55:10 as well and you get sometime scholarship
55:12 if if you are eligible and it is very
55:15 easy to get 100% scholarship from
55:19 corera uh they can attend that as well
55:23 and Frankly Speaking I am a person who
55:26 always learn through projects so uh for
55:30 example uh whatever skill set you want
55:32 to learn find a GitHub project on that
55:35 and just do it so it is really great
55:38 learning and other ways teaching just
55:41 figure out find out your friend and
55:42 start teaching them so you will you will
55:45 be proficient in that skill I think it's
55:48 a so this is more like um a general
55:51 neutral advice right like it applies for
55:55 any G there and just learn through
56:00 projects and there is uh there are a lot
56:02 of courses already like on cair on then
56:06 of course data do club we also have
56:08 amazing courses so you can just find
56:11 them and um check them
56:15 out okay I think that's all we have uh
56:19 planned for today so maybe before we
56:22 finish um if you know any resources on
56:27 any resources that you want to share
56:29 maybe resources on teaching resources on
56:31 community building or resources or on
56:34 anything else you you find
56:37 interesting uh I uh as as I have already
56:41 shared and mentioned uh I prefer to read
56:45 newsletters like um uh I I have I am
56:50 part of uh one interesting uh uh
56:55 Stanford law University Law Department
56:58 newsletter they have ai Howard law
57:00 school they have ai uh newsletter so for
57:06 me those are very interesting because
57:08 now at this stage uh we have already AI
57:13 uh skill set now we need to think how to
57:17 ethically Implement that uh I will also
57:20 prefer people and I think it is uh good
57:24 to learn how what are the privacy and
57:28 ethical concerns bringing AI into in our
57:32 day-to-day life and if we don't address
57:34 that uh we might not able to you know
57:37 bring it 100% so that's how I like maybe
57:41 I I don't remember this the link 100% I
57:44 will share later and if you would able
57:46 to share that put this in description
57:48 yeah yeah this
57:50 is something I expect at least to be
57:53 honest like Stanford Law School
57:56 that's interesting like how AI is
57:59 everywhere now and
58:01 also yeah why not I'm really curious to
58:04 see what kind of content they have there
58:07 okay yeah thanks a lot uh you for
58:09 joining us today for sharing your
58:10 knowledge your experience with us and
58:13 thanks everyone too for joining us for
58:15 asking questions for being active and uh
