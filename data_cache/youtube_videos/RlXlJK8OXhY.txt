0:00 so hi everyone Welcome to our event this
0:03 event is brought to you by data do club
0:05 which is a community of people who love
0:07 data we have weekly events and if you
0:10 want to find out more about the events
0:12 we have there is a link in the
0:14 description click on that link and see
0:16 what we have in our pipeline actually we
0:19 are scheduling like a ton of new podcast
0:22 interviews like I think we have five or
0:25 six um so you need to watch out there
0:28 will be announcements and this page is
0:30 where you can see them also don't forget
0:35 to subscribe to our YouTube channel this
0:37 way you will also get notifications
0:39 about uh streams like the one we have
0:41 today and we have an amazing slack
0:43 Community where you can hang out with
0:45 other dat
0:47 into during today's talk presentation
0:50 you can ask any question you want there
0:52 is a slid link it's pinned in the live
0:55 chat click on that link ask your
0:57 questions and we will be covering these
0:59 questions after the
1:01 presentation so I think that's all I did
1:04 not forget to say anything H Andreas now
1:08 the floor is yours please share your
1:10 screen and let's
1:12 start okay so I have to remember how
1:17 actually
1:19 uh oh I have to give permission to share
1:22 the screen okay
1:24 this you don't use zoom
1:27 that's just give me two second I
1:31 will already leaking details oh my
1:35 God you mean about the the company where
1:38 you work yeah oh my God we're not using
1:41 Zoom
1:44 no I imagine okay so if you were to
1:47 estimate uh how often does the
1:50 permission sharing happen then we can
1:52 estimate the zoom
1:54 adoption
1:56 um not that uh
2:01 like I don't remember last time it
2:02 happened actually oh my God yeah want to
2:05 adopt late majority yeah everything is
2:09 going well not everyone is on Mac that's
2:12 also like on Windows or Linux you don't
2:14 need to to do
2:16 that all right um Andre Alex are you
2:19 seeing the screen yes sorry oh yeah
2:22 perfect then sorry everyone for that for
2:24 the short for like for the short uh uh
2:26 Interruption but at least now we can
2:27 share and everything is fine okay so hi
2:30 everyone so today we will be with
2:32 Andreas talking about inventory
2:33 optimization in e-commerce and the good
2:35 thing is that we're not only going to
2:36 talk about it like in the thetical way
2:38 or from you know far away but we going
2:40 to actually base it on our experience as
2:42 Alando and really share like you know
2:43 what we learned what type of issues we
2:45 met and what type of solutions you know
2:47 we end up finding um so I remember I was
2:50 talking with a couple of scientists and
2:52 from different companies like they do
2:54 either food delivery or they are like
2:56 you know pure e-commerce and I remember
2:58 like this topic of inventory
2:59 optimization is a big one and we will
3:01 see that actually lately this topic even
3:04 be like become a bigger one due to uh uh
3:07 due to basically uh the topics of cost
3:10 optimization and also being efficient in
3:11 the way we do operations so I'm hoping
3:14 that this conversation will be
3:15 interesting and that um yeah we will we
3:18 will be having fun and hopefully you
3:19 know we can also catch up after that
3:23 yeah so uh before we do that I would
3:25 like to maybe give us you like a short
3:27 introduction of ourselves so uh um um so
3:30 hi everyone I'm hagop senior apped
3:33 scientist at zando have been working at
3:36 zando for now three years almost and
3:38 doing applied science for the last six
3:40 seven years I had the pleasure to also
3:43 so to work with alexe and yeah so um I'm
3:46 usually very passionate about anything
3:49 that touches like data science deep
3:50 learning like specialty uh green tea
3:52 cycling and running on my personal time
3:55 and also my biggest hobby is my son who
3:57 probably can be joining in the room with
3:59 the call so I hope that's that's also
4:02 fine and yeah on that I would like to
4:04 give the floor toas for
4:06 presentation hey everyone Andreas I'm a
4:09 principal applied scientist at slando
4:12 I've been here for roughly two two and a
4:14 half years uh and somehow throughout my
4:17 career I always end up doing Logistics
4:20 never really planned it that way but
4:22 here I am um yeah uh and uh I guess also
4:27 I do things outside of work uh you
4:29 usually it involves some kind of board
4:31 sport or uh tabletop uh role playing
4:34 games as a big as a big activity for me
4:37 it's a great way to keep touch with the
4:39 old friends what is a board
4:41 sport uh
4:43 snowboarding um skateboarding
4:47 boarding you got two feet on a board
4:51 you two feet on the board is is a is a
4:54 good description this okay but um right
4:58 okay so uh yeah so this was us contact
5:01 us afterwards um we're pretty nice I
5:03 think I hope so yeah don't hesitate but
5:06 before we do super important um we are
5:08 obviously the ones presenting the work
5:10 and the learnings but it's only two of
5:12 us right so the effort has been done by
5:14 a bigger uh uh by by much bigger team
5:17 and actually we would really like to
5:18 thank them before we even start and that
5:19 you also remind that if you need that
5:21 information you can also you know have a
5:23 contact with this with with any member
5:25 of the team and yeah so thanks to them
5:27 so super important and specifically call
5:30 out if you look in the bottom right the
5:31 little purple ribbon there exactly
5:34 hiring that is also true so so the team
5:36 is also hiring uh like depends on the
5:38 position sometimes data engineering
5:39 sometimes it's plat science or probably
5:41 also machine learning engineering
5:42 depending on the time of the year um
5:45 yeah so please stay tuned and also happy
5:48 to meet you for that purpose so very
5:50 important good that you us very nice
5:54 okay good so the agenda for today um we
5:57 will basically uh try to to be doing it
6:00 in 30 minutes 40 minutes and then we
6:01 have time for like for the questions and
6:03 the plan is very simple so we will start
6:06 by saying okay so what's even like the
6:07 problem of inventory optimization there
6:09 is a lot of uh you know let's say
6:13 misunderstanding about the topic several
6:16 people say inventory optimization but
6:17 they always mean different things so we
6:19 hoping that this time you know we really
6:20 kind of set up that and try to Anchor
6:22 like the discussion um based on that
6:25 we'll basically talk about what our
6:26 inventory policies and what type of
6:28 equations we're even trying to optimize
6:30 right like what's the cost equation
6:31 we're trying to optimize um the
6:33 limitations of deterministic
6:35 optimization that are very very common
6:36 and and often baselines on this type of
6:39 exercises and uh you know just review
6:41 over optimization approach uh and use
6:43 techniques that you found but also we
6:44 tried and the one that we are actually
6:46 betting on in production and uh and
6:49 hoping to develop in the future and um
6:51 there will be like a very small particle
6:53 like like a technical part that is very
6:54 important we will basically talking
6:56 about how we took all this thetical
6:58 concept right and we make it and and
6:59 made it real and how we ended up
7:01 basically having something that for
7:03 those who do inventory optimization this
7:06 number seems pretty uh pretty uh pretty
7:09 pretty familiar you're basically able to
7:11 optimize for a given SQ or a given
7:12 article in less than like 20
7:13 milliseconds which if you think
7:15 optimization you usually think of
7:16 seconds of minutes so we actually
7:18 managed to reduce that to like something
7:20 that is reable and also real time and
7:22 we're hoping that we also discuss some
7:23 uh let's say um technical uh
7:25 implementation topics and see how we did
7:27 this it's also pretty interesting so not
7:29 only theoretical and Mathematics but
7:31 also applied concept behind and some
7:34 mlops um Concepts so that's the genda
7:38 and at any time ask questions we're more
7:40 than happy to stop or even take them at
7:42 the end good um then on last you can I
7:45 guess start with the mental condition
7:46 topic cool cool cool and I'll I'll rign
7:48 you for pressing the button sounds good
7:51 it so uh first of all uh kind of 10,000
7:56 ft view uh so uh let's take a step back
7:59 and think about okay so we're in applied
8:00 science we're trying to solve a problem
8:02 um uh how do we how do we approach this
8:06 inventory optimization problem and
8:08 there's this model that would like to
8:09 think about uh so essentially uh almost
8:12 all applied science problems have these
8:15 three components you got a decision uh a
8:18 policy and some inputs into your policy
8:20 now what's the decision I mean this
8:21 might seem obvious uh but it's important
8:25 to recognize right I used to call this
8:27 the the money moment so when in real
8:29 life does something happen where uh the
8:33 world diverges into two parallel
8:35 universes one where you make more money
8:38 and one where you make less money for
8:39 example uh and kind of identifying this
8:43 point so I've given some examples here
8:46 uh so for example you're working in
8:48 Insurance uh there's a decision to
8:50 approve an insurance claim right and uh
8:53 if you're correct in that decision there
8:55 are some outcomes if you're wrong in
8:57 that decision uh as assuming there such
9:00 a thing is wrong there's some other
9:01 outcomes and and this is this is the
9:04 goal right to optimize this decision it
9:07 could also be you decide to increase the
9:08 rotor Trust on a drone uh or that you
9:12 decide to ship 100 items to the
9:13 warehouse right uh and then working
9:16 backwards then you would say okay so if
9:18 I now want to optimize my decision uh
9:21 then I need to find some policy to take
9:23 that decision still right even in
9:25 classification you end up deciding on
9:28 your uh thresholds and the
9:31 classification threshold of course
9:32 impacts your uh the cost picture or the
9:36 the the outcome picture of then using
9:39 let's say a classification model uh you
9:42 also see a policy in control theory
9:44 right so if you're having a drone uh you
9:47 might have an lqr controller running in
9:49 there uh and that acts as a policy and
9:53 in our case for replenishment you might
9:55 look at an RSQ policy now hagab will
9:58 tell you more about those
10:00 uh but there would be a policy right and
10:02 to run any kind of policy you of course
10:05 need some inputs and some of those
10:06 inputs they're know maybe you just query
10:08 your database you have them and some of
10:10 those inputs you don't have perhaps uh
10:13 in uh the replenishment use case uh You'
10:16 be uh wondering what is the upcoming
10:19 demand obviously the future isn't in my
10:22 database so I need to estimate that uh
10:25 for example if you're running a drone uh
10:27 you do state estimation right and and so
10:29 the the data that you don't know or that
10:31 is uncertain you do
10:33 estimates uh and um uh in the claims
10:39 situation you might uh use a
10:41 classification model as input into your
10:43 policy so kind of this is the
10:44 overarching model that we want to apply
10:47 and uh hob if you uh click the click the
10:51 space I guess yeah um so here and I
10:55 already alluded to this right but so how
10:56 does this look in our case well in our
10:58 case you have some Supply planner and
11:01 they're uh sitting at work uh they're
11:03 going through uh the inventory uh and
11:06 they're deciding to ship a given number
11:09 of a given article on a given date to a
11:12 warehouse right and this is
11:14 where fundamentally uh the outcome is
11:18 decided right and this is the decision
11:20 we need to optimize uh then you look at
11:22 a policy so a replenishment decision it
11:25 consists of what when how much you
11:28 decide and and what you want to do is
11:30 you want to optimize for profit right or
11:32 you might have some other goal but let's
11:34 use profit now it's a it's a very
11:36 convenient one you can get that far um
11:39 and then for these uh what are the
11:41 inputs well to do this you need to know
11:43 the current stock level this you
11:44 probably know in your database uh and uh
11:48 you need to know the upcoming demand to
11:50 anticipate it and this you probably need
11:52 to estimate right um uh and you might
11:56 want to understand your resellable
11:57 returns and so on so this is now kind of
12:00 having the overall mental model let's
12:02 now zoom into how you might approach the
12:05 the inventory oranization
12:07 problem uh so uh yeah uh inventory
12:12 optimization in e-commerce let's
12:15 go uh so uh as I already mentioned right
12:20 what we're looking at is what when and
12:22 where uh right so uh this is
12:25 fundamentally what replenishment is
12:27 about you need your inventory to be
12:28 there when the customer is ready to buy
12:31 uh now you need to decide when to put it
12:34 there if you put it too early you end up
12:35 storing inventory for a long time uh and
12:39 if you put it there too late you might
12:41 uh have what's called a stockout which
12:43 is when you are out of inventory and any
12:46 customer coming to buy your product uh
12:49 they're now not able to purchase it and
12:52 then of course uh just like you need to
12:54 be there at the right time you need to
12:55 be there at the right location so if you
12:57 can't ship to the customer when they're
12:59 ready to buy uh then of course you're
13:02 not able to close the sale uh so
13:04 fundamentally these are the sub
13:06 questions um now let's dig a little bit
13:09 deeper into this so how might you
13:11 understand this decision uh in terms of
13:14 outcomes so a simple kind of traditional
13:17 model of how you look at this you'd say
13:19 you're getting some inventory from A
13:21 supplier into a warehouse you'll incur a
13:24 cost shipping from the supplier to the
13:26 warehouse probably also unpacking into
13:28 the warehouse and so on uh in addition
13:31 of course if you're buying it from A
13:32 supplier you need to pay the supplier
13:34 for the goods uh so now you bound up
13:37 some Capital uh the inventory is sitting
13:39 in your Warehouse uh and then the
13:41 customer comes to buy it and then you
13:43 incur an outbound processing cost so uh
13:46 the customer makes a purchase you got to
13:47 ship it to them uh your uh your shipment
13:52 supply chain is then going to of course
13:53 incur a cost now in reality uh as as is
13:58 customary when you come to reality it
14:00 isn't that easy um so here we're
14:04 developing a few more of the factors
14:05 right so uh often especially in online
14:09 uh Commerce you have a significant
14:11 amount of returns uh so uh uh after
14:15 selling to a customer you might actually
14:18 have to pay for processing a return from
14:20 that customer uh but on the other hand
14:23 uh many items that are returned you
14:26 could potentially sell again right um so
14:29 kind of Silver Lining uh then in
14:31 addition uh you need to understand well
14:34 what opportunity did you lose with your
14:36 actions so for example if you didn't
14:39 have inventory in your Warehouse when a
14:41 customer was there to buy uh you had a
14:44 lost sale right and so you could
14:46 understand that as a opportunity cost uh
14:49 of being out of stock uh and on the
14:52 contrary if you're having a bunch of
14:53 inventory sitting in your Warehouse
14:55 doing nothing not only is it acre a
14:57 storage cost uh but also you might have
15:00 done something else with it let's say
15:02 you're uh you're having both physical
15:07 stores and online e-commerce uh you
15:09 might then say okay uh if I if it was
15:12 just sitting in the warehouse I might
15:13 have put that in some of my retail
15:15 stores uh so there's of course an
15:18 opportunity cost of Overstock too um so
15:22 yeah uh breaking this down uh or or
15:24 rather developing in this so there are
15:26 some practical constraints too so uh we
15:30 in the real world usually have pretty
15:32 complex systems so uh in our situation
15:35 we're talking millions of different
15:37 articles uh right a lot of a lot of
15:40 decisions to replenish uh we're also
15:42 having what's uh to use a fancy term
15:45 multi-echelon system right so you got
15:48 multiple warehouses multiple types of
15:50 warehouses doing different types of
15:53 operations uh and uh flows between these
15:56 warehouses they might even cost
15:58 different depending on which direction
16:00 you're shipping things uh then you also
16:02 have seasonal Goods right so uh perhaps
16:05 if you're selling black socks you could
16:07 sell those uh all year every year but
16:10 for example uh shorts you probably only
16:13 sell in the summer and sometime in the
16:15 winter when people go to
16:16 Vacation um so uh the value of shorts
16:20 sitting in a warehouse varies uh over
16:23 time uh and then of course what I
16:25 already mentioned before uh often you
16:29 see pretty high return rate so you can't
16:31 assume that returns is a non uh is a
16:34 non-significant part actually the way it
16:37 rather turns out is much of much of the
16:39 inventory you have on hand you have on
16:41 hand because of a
16:44 return um yeah uh so
16:49 um to add to this right you have uh a
16:53 lot of uncertainty in Supply chains and
16:56 arguably uh the the job of a supply
16:59 chain optim Optimizer or supply chain
17:02 planner is really to deal with the
17:03 uncertainty if you knew exactly what
17:05 would happen in the future if you knew
17:07 ex exactly how many items a customer
17:09 would want to buy uh you could easily do
17:12 some plus and minus and figure out how
17:14 much you need in the warehouse but of
17:16 course that's not the reality uh the
17:18 weather changes customers purchase
17:20 patterns uh you have fundamental
17:22 uncertainty in demand you know someone
17:24 someone about to click Buy and they get
17:26 distracted by uh uh by their family
17:30 right uh fundamental uncertainties you
17:32 got economical factors that you can't
17:34 really predict uh as we know uh we have
17:38 pandemics geopolitical tensions trade
17:40 barriers all kinds of things kind of
17:43 coming in and messing up your nice
17:45 mental mold right um so um with all of
17:50 this said let's get a bit more concrete
17:54 so how might it look then like if we're
17:56 really coming down to what would a
17:58 mathematical model of this look like so
18:00 at a very high level uh at least what
18:03 we're proposing here you want to
18:04 maximize profit
18:06 contribution uh and uh what do you do
18:08 this well you do this with respect to
18:10 your Revenue storage the Lost sales
18:13 opportunity cost um the uh Overstock the
18:17 cost of opportunity cost of having
18:19 Overstock uh and the cost of the
18:20 operations you need to go through to
18:22 actually carry out uh your your
18:25 replenishments uh and so here I put in a
18:28 very simp simplified form a kind of
18:30 optimization problem uh and later on
18:32 you'll see how we how we tackle that in
18:34 reality of course this becomes a
18:36 constraint optimization problem and
18:38 there's a whole question about how you
18:39 estimate the objective function and so
18:42 on um
18:45 cool so I believe I'm now handing over
18:48 to H yeah thanks andas so um basically
18:51 now that we know the environment in
18:53 which we operate and also the problem
18:55 that we have to solve right so how do we
18:57 do that so that's why we're going to
18:59 talk about inventory policies right and
19:01 the cost equation to optimize basically
19:04 so the first thing is um the policy
19:08 right so some who maybe have worked in
19:10 like in re like in reinforcement
19:12 learning or supply chain or operation
19:13 research might be more familiar with it
19:16 but what does a policy mean right so
19:17 basically a policy is us trying to
19:19 narrow dime kind of like the dimension
19:22 of the problem right so we're trying to
19:23 narrow down uh like down the like the
19:26 decision space right and the decision
19:28 space is called like inventary policy so
19:30 there are like a lot of them in the in
19:32 the literature and we can give some very
19:34 simplified examples so like the most
19:35 common ones that are let's say more
19:37 school examples is what we call the SQ
19:40 policy or the a US policy right for
19:42 example the first one which is the SQ
19:44 policy is when you basically Define a
19:47 point from which you trigger a
19:49 replenishment or a production order and
19:53 Q is the quantity uh uh that you that
19:56 you basically order or replenish
19:59 so let's say you reach a certain point s
20:01 right then at this point you decide to
20:03 trigger your replenishment or your
20:04 production decision with certain Le time
20:07 the quantity that you ordered actually
20:08 comes up a couple of days later then the
20:11 inventory so like SS out until it
20:13 reaches again the same reorder point
20:15 with the lead time you order a quantity
20:17 etc etc etc and the other pattern would
20:20 be for example where you design what we
20:21 call like a review frequency and a Max
20:24 order right where basically every two
20:26 weeks or every three weeks or every one
20:28 week depending on on the on the r you
20:30 basically automatically trigger a
20:31 replenishment or a production decision
20:33 until a certain point right so then you
20:35 basically let's say every R this can be
20:37 any date right any any period every like
20:40 specific R you basically automatically
20:42 trigger the decision is taken with some
20:44 lead time then your uh basically uh
20:47 replenishment or your inbound happens
20:50 then your stock is updated and etc etc
20:53 the the good thing about this is that
20:55 really you're trying to make basically
20:58 very comp licated decisions and trying
20:59 to reduce the space in a low dimensional
21:02 space where it's actually even feasible
21:04 to solve like the problem right so let's
21:05 say for every SKU so every article we
21:08 want to find like these optimal values
21:10 and which ones they be um the first
21:13 question is wait so which one do I
21:15 choose right so you said that there are
21:17 many and you just gave us two examples
21:18 actually there are a lot and not all of
21:20 them are realistic some of them are
21:22 simplistic they do not work but um so
21:25 what we can say about them is that most
21:27 Poes actually have do have have some
21:29 nice properties in theory right so they
21:30 are very good school examples where you
21:32 can study and like learn the concept but
21:34 most of the time we actually fail to
21:36 satisfy some of the assumptions that
21:37 they're based on um for example they are
21:40 not adapted for articles that are
21:42 extremely understuck at the start right
21:44 so if you're like if you're having a
21:46 season good let's say at the start at of
21:48 your of your sales season you have
21:50 almost no no inventory or even after
21:53 stock out you have no inventory so
21:54 basically um you don't know how to
21:56 handle that case U most of the time they
21:58 make the assumption that we have like a
22:01 like some sort of cost of Demand right
22:02 with with unlimited window of sale so
22:05 the concept of season or the concept of
22:07 perishable good basically with an end of
22:09 you know like lifetime for that article
22:11 doesn't exist they assume that you know
22:13 you can basically be selling or
22:15 replenishing this article forever which
22:17 is not great right and what what really
22:20 also bothers is that they make the
22:22 assumption that most of the time your
22:23 demand is stationary right that you know
22:25 it like it follows like you know a
22:26 constant demand and and it's like let's
22:29 say like some sort ofon process but it
22:31 doesn't have you know High season low
22:32 season like it doesn't have this you
22:34 know a constantly evolving Trend which
22:36 you know is not really realistic so we
22:39 really took this we like okay so how can
22:40 we end up having a policy right that
22:43 still is kind of simplifies our life and
22:45 makes that the decision space is small
22:47 but actually is adaptable to a real use
22:49 case so we ended up taking what we call
22:51 the RSQ policy and we adapted it a bit
22:54 so the RSQ is basically is every week or
22:57 every period R every review period R I
23:01 check if I am reaching the limit and if
23:05 I do reach that limit I basically uh you
23:08 know um order a certain quantity to
23:10 replenish or either to basically produce
23:11 and inventory
23:13 automatically that's a simplified and we
23:15 were like Okay so this still doesn't
23:17 work we have to adapt it further so we
23:19 basically took this and then we added
23:22 some parameters in it so we kept r s and
23:25 Q but we added three terms that are very
23:27 important we added the first next
23:29 replenishment week Index right so if I'm
23:31 today and I'm making this optimization
23:33 now or if I'm making it tomorrow what
23:35 would be the next recommended or what
23:37 would be like the next optimal time at
23:39 which I should basically trigger my next
23:41 replenishment and what should be the
23:43 quantity q0 for that replenishment why
23:46 do we basically have a major focus on
23:48 the next replenishment is that well
23:50 obviously the concept of you know SQ and
23:52 like something recurring is nice and
23:54 efficient but it actually makes very
23:56 little sense if you kind of you know
23:58 mess up your first or
24:00 next
24:07 there's
24:08 so sorry about that life as a parent is
24:11 not always easy all right so I was
24:13 saying why do we care that much about
24:15 the next replenishment actually because
24:16 if we really do mess up the next like
24:18 replenishment like the long term makes
24:19 little sense right like kind of you know
24:21 it becomes very difficult to catch up or
24:22 to even make any um meaningful decision
24:25 so what do we do is that okay so let's
24:26 give a bit more freedom to the next
24:28 decision right the next time of the
24:29 replenishment the next quantity and then
24:31 let's let the algorithm to plan it
24:32 further like like replenishment with
24:34 some degree of Freedom so if we have a
24:37 look at this policy how it looks like it
24:39 looks like this so we want to basically
24:42 Define the t0o basically when you should
24:44 next like zero in terms of python so
24:47 when should your first or next
24:48 replenishment be at which quantity given
24:51 that you also give you freedom for
24:52 afterward to replenish if you need right
24:54 several times following a very uh easy
24:57 policy but we also give you a t limit it
24:59 tweets that you would basically have to
25:01 tell us when you think given a certain
25:02 you know demand forecast pattern when
25:05 you think it makes no more sense to do
25:07 replenishment or do any other operation
25:10 so from RSQ we ended up to basically
25:12 like a more realistic uh a problem where
25:15 we give a lot of freedom for the first
25:16 one and we say Define your next Define
25:19 some future replenishment but also tell
25:21 us when we think you know or when the
25:23 algorithm thinks we should stop even
25:24 planning any that replenishment so this
25:27 basically you know hope hopefully if you
25:28 have like let's say a seasonal pattern
25:30 right where you have a start of the
25:32 Season High season and then end of the
25:34 season you basically want toest stand up
25:36 something like this where at the end of
25:37 the season right you have no more stock
25:39 and you tell okay let's stop
25:41 replenishing we're out of the Season
25:42 we're not you know need to have anything
25:44 so you basically block it and if you're
25:46 basically um running this every day this
25:49 is dynamic right so the decision changes
25:52 and basically every time your situation
25:54 changed like might be that your like
25:56 your forecast changes something happened
25:57 to theice price something happened in
25:59 the stock some exceptional returns came
26:01 back basically this decision is is
26:04 adapted to you know uh being modified
26:06 over time and you have to run it on a
26:08 regular
26:09 basis um yeah so this is what we need to
26:13 find this is the decision space to
26:14 optimize right so think about it for
26:16 those who do like machine learning or or
26:17 deep learning these are literally like
26:19 your weights basically these are the
26:20 weights that we need to find but these
26:22 weights have you know a business meaning
26:23 basically they're not the weights of a
26:25 model but they're the weights of your
26:26 business you know your supply chain uh
26:29 basically uh space so um yeah how does
26:34 the cost equation look like so Andreas
26:36 mentioned actually profit optimization
26:38 so basic more like profit contribution
26:40 optimization where we trying to maximize
26:42 it and if we were like to remind that in
26:44 terms of terms that would be you
26:46 basically sum up your Revenue that
26:47 you're expecting from your policy minus
26:49 the cost of shipping to the customer the
26:51 holding cost minus replenishment
26:53 shipment cost the return processing cost
26:55 Purchase cost and your alternative cost
26:57 of over stock right let's say at the end
26:59 of the six months you way too much
27:01 Overstock you have to basically discount
27:03 them or do something with it and you
27:05 basically you know take that cost but to
27:07 basically simplify the operation we can
27:09 also like Express this not anymore as a
27:11 profit contribution maximization but as
27:14 a cost minimization exercise which is
27:16 simpler to represent as long as we have
27:18 the cost of loss sales right so like the
27:20 cost of loss sales would be in your
27:22 simulations or in your basically policy
27:25 when you should have had stock to
27:27 fulfill some demand but you didn't end
27:29 up having stocks so you weren't able to
27:31 fulfill the demand of the customer so
27:32 you ended up basically losing money and
27:34 once you put that equation or then then
27:36 then then your reality becomes okay then
27:38 actually we need to minimize um this
27:41 both of them are equivalent as long as
27:43 like you respect this constraint right
27:45 um but you know often the cost
27:47 minimization exercise is is much simpler
27:50 right and if you think about it you know
27:52 we're in a time where you know like
27:54 economically like difficult situations
27:57 and you know where where basically the
28:00 concept of being coste efficient
28:02 important this is you know like a pure
28:04 example right like we don't have to make
28:06 any more decisions that are you know
28:07 random or they're not efficient there is
28:09 always a way to basically anchor
28:13 your decision space and you know to to
28:16 to some economical value like like to
28:18 some cost value and if you want to be
28:20 you know efficient then you can actually
28:22 go and model that and then try to
28:23 optimize that so that's the main purpose
28:25 of this exercise right okay
28:28 um this is how it looks like then and if
28:32 we were to visually like represent that
28:34 um and then let's say on the x-axis we
28:36 have our parameter set Theta and then on
28:38 the Y set we have the function of theta
28:40 so basically like the cost that we're
28:41 trying to like to minimize then we would
28:44 ideally land you know in this in this in
28:46 this in this Global minimum area right
28:49 um it's not fully convex but we will
28:51 also Show You by plotting some cost
28:53 space later on that actually like like
28:56 this type of linear equation especially
28:58 inventory they tend to be rather convex
29:00 so they're not you know like the
29:01 spikiest or like you don't end up having
29:04 tens of different you know like local
29:05 minimas but you do end up having maybe a
29:07 couple of local minimas but still like
29:09 you do have this like very nice uh
29:11 semiconvex uh you know or actually fully
29:14 convex pattern so so it it does become a
29:17 rather let's say a nice exercise um to
29:21 solve um
29:24 yeah and um the policy input right so we
29:28 talked about the problem the policies so
29:29 the decision space we like okay so how
29:31 how do you make your decision space
29:33 we're going to talk about input right
29:34 right so what do we feed in basically
29:36 like your features in this in this in
29:38 this problem to end up having like your
29:39 decision so like a reminder right what
29:42 do we even need to optimiz policy we
29:45 have to distinguish basically between
29:46 two categories like I think already
29:48 mentioned what we know right because we
29:51 observe or we we took addition on
29:53 already this can be the current stock
29:54 level the price of the item the
29:56 processing cost if the there is the
29:58 stock and Transit that we started that
29:59 is like on the way what we do not know
30:02 and we have to estimate so basically
30:04 this is pure you know forecast right um
30:06 and this can be machine learning
30:07 forecasting it can be statistical
30:09 forecasting any type of forecasting but
30:10 you have to estimate them for example um
30:13 alternative cost of Overstock upcoming
30:15 demand um expected returns your lead
30:18 times um you know many many parameters
30:20 that you already mentioned that
30:22 basically um you know you have to
30:24 forecast so that's difficult because um
30:28 they are basically completely sometimes
30:30 independent you know Upstream products
30:32 right demand forecast is like as one
30:34 product return forecast can be like
30:35 another product you basically have to
30:37 take this already stochastic or
30:39 probabilistic uncertain inputs and you
30:41 have to make a decision that accounts
30:43 for the variance that you have in your
30:44 uh in your in your inflence so think
30:47 about that the problem is already pretty
30:49 difficult so here also make a kind of
30:52 pragmatic comment right so I think many
30:55 of you can probably relate to it being
30:58 kind of sexy to do estimation and it's
31:02 easy for a business to get stuck
31:04 focusing a lot on the estimation but if
31:07 you look at the overall problem the
31:09 estimation is a very clear means to an
31:11 end and an estimate can be as simple as
31:15 get taking the mean right you if you
31:18 imagine the policy we've been describing
31:20 you could take uh like estimate the
31:23 normal distribution for the demand and
31:26 call a DAT right that's still an
31:28 estimate and only when you need that
31:30 estimate to get better like a sharper
31:33 probability distribution or less bias uh
31:36 that's when you start looking into more
31:38 complex techniques uh but of course it's
31:41 very easy to get stuck in uh spend like
31:44 investing considerably in your
31:46 estimations uh when actually uh the
31:49 policy might be where the where the shoe
31:50 doesn't fit that's that's true and I
31:53 like I like the fact and I think it's
31:55 important to put in mind that basically
31:56 any forecast isn't like in this business
31:59 environment is just a mean to like to
32:01 reach a goal right so like the forecast
32:03 will be a hammer right but you know if
32:06 you like like you basically have to take
32:08 your nail you have to take your painting
32:09 you have to basically put like the nail
32:11 put the painting that's the end goal
32:13 right like having something beautiful on
32:14 the on the wall and that's something
32:16 beautiful then is like you know is is
32:17 your actually health of your business
32:19 right like how do you run like you know
32:22 healthy Logistics operations that's your
32:23 end goal and a forecast as beautiful as
32:27 it is it just just only useful if you
32:29 use it in the right way afterwards in
32:31 the downstream application and um I
32:34 think if I remember like Andreas like
32:36 you actually realize that many people on
32:38 online chats and I think even we we
32:40 presented or at least I did present
32:41 demand
32:42 forecasting uh series couple of months
32:45 or years ago and you were basically
32:47 wondering you know like or you noticed
32:49 that people were wondering or saying hey
32:51 now I have forecast great now what do I
32:53 do with it right so so so I think that's
32:55 like that's the type of like um
32:57 conversation
32:58 and it's true that title
33:01 once true so I have forecast now what do
33:05 I do with it I think it's a it's a it's
33:07 a good question so let's see what uh and
33:10 how do we do with it all right um but
33:13 before we go into like the actual
33:16 mathematical solutions that we found and
33:18 how do we solve this um so it's good
33:21 that we even you know spend time on the
33:23 concept of the terministic which the
33:25 stochastic right and why actually there
33:27 has to be this distinction and what you
33:28 know passing from the terministic to
33:30 stochastic actually even brings to your
33:32 use case um and to do that I would like
33:35 to basically remind right that
33:37 deterministic forecast as inputs right
33:40 what do they mean is basically when you
33:41 have one point per time of forecast
33:44 right let's say you're trying to
33:46 forecast demand for next week and then
33:48 you end up saying next week I will I
33:50 forecast I will have 500 units then we C
33:52 150 whatever right so but you always
33:54 only give one one value per forecast
33:58 and you do this for all of your inputs
33:59 right like you say that my lead time is
34:01 eight days right my shipment lead time
34:03 is eight days my return rate is 50% or
34:06 30% or 20% or whatever but you know you
34:09 basically always end up having one value
34:10 and you're very very confident about
34:12 that value right and that's
34:14 deterministic and I think that Alexi we
34:17 played this game together but I still
34:18 would like that we play it again so I'm
34:20 gonna ask your questions and we then
34:22 like you know try to resonate if indeed
34:24 it's it's you know it does make any
34:26 difference so Alex I first tell you
34:28 right that we have a model that is
34:30 forecasting that the demand for next
34:32 week is going to be 5,000 units okay
34:35 that's the information and now I tell
34:37 you actually Alexi I forgot we have
34:39 another model that is saying that it's
34:40 highly possible that one of these three
34:42 like this like distributions can occur
34:45 around the same value right and the
34:47 question is then how would you reach
34:49 this like how would you take this input
34:51 right would you react in the same way
34:54 okay so the question is um
34:57 there is an estimate on the number of
35:00 items for a certain product right and we
35:02 know that um this estimation is uh so
35:08 this was a point estimation but there is
35:09 some distribution around that estimation
35:12 right um and your question
35:16 is uh would I behave differently knowing
35:21 that it's distribution one distribution
35:23 two or distribution three right would I
35:25 consider different things exactly
35:29 uh well I
35:32 guess so so let's say like in this case
35:35 right where you have this type of like
35:37 Pon process right where you oh wow I can
35:40 actually have an exposion of demand and
35:42 that thing is rather sudden what would
35:43 you do Cas would you order more like in
35:45 this case yeah because like in thir
35:48 distribution the uncertainty is like the
35:50 the variance is smaller right so I'm
35:52 more certain in my decision yeah in the
35:55 second case like I'm less certain in
35:57 myis decision and thir is like there
35:59 could be a spike right exactly exactly
36:02 so so so basically like what you said
36:05 ends up being most of the time reflected
36:07 in a very concrete you know decision
36:08 inventory which is your safety stock
36:10 basically how much stock you want to
36:12 have that you don't want to really touch
36:14 or not as much as possible that
36:16 basically is trying to account for that
36:18 variance like in the future that
36:19 decision is somehow implicitly done in
36:22 the in the in the decision space that
36:24 that we think you can specify it and
36:26 like find a way in your simulation to
36:27 isolate it and have a specific value for
36:29 that but when you do optimize in a nice
36:31 way and you're having like this
36:32 distribution for castet right you
36:34 actually have an impact on the Safety
36:35 stock if you're like the more uncertain
36:37 you are the more safety stock you will
36:38 have so as you said right you would
36:40 basically have more risk uh pattern
36:43 there so Alex now I give you like the
36:45 thing of the demand now I tell you
36:47 another thing actually your lead time
36:49 can be8 days so if you make a decision
36:50 to order you can only have it in eight
36:52 days not so not before you know someone
36:54 has to pack it has to make it like in a
36:56 beautiful box has to put in a beautiful
36:57 you know car and that car has to R like
37:00 to your destination and now I tell you
37:04 okay so even that has you know oh oh oh
37:07 sorry I put the so even that has you
37:09 know completely different pattern so is
37:12 it always possible then it's going to be
37:13 eight days or sometimes it's eight
37:15 sometimes it's six sometimes it's 12
37:17 your like your average is eight but it's
37:19 never the case that it will always be
37:20 there so that even there you're not
37:22 really sure so add more basically
37:24 uncertainty
37:25 there okay and now I Alexa you're not
37:28 lucky all of your inputs have the same
37:30 [Music]
37:32 pattern so realistically there is no way
37:35 you have confidence in any of your
37:37 inputs neither your lead time neither
37:39 like your demand forecast neither your
37:40 return and I also don't know the
37:42 distribution rate or I have some ideas
37:45 it's up to you to make that decision we
37:46 gonna so there's a choice where you
37:48 basically are a bit more adventurous and
37:50 you make a decision on the sh so like
37:51 you know like a prior and some you got
37:54 some prior data right so you can
37:57 sometimes you can but for example like
37:59 for the demand you can't for the lead
38:02 time you do like you do observe some
38:04 pattern so you can basically make some
38:05 priors but for the demand you can't or
38:08 you basically have to make really you
38:09 know strong assumptions that huh why on
38:14 the demand well let's say you have
38:16 millions of skus right one SKU can have
38:19 you know a person distribution the other
38:21 can have Goan the other like can have
38:24 gamma like basically are you ready to
38:26 make your assumption that all of your
38:29 skus have a demand pattern that on any
38:31 given time table have the same
38:32 distribution for all right is that I can
38:35 give you one example that is really
38:37 tough if you try to do this right so uh
38:40 the distributional Assumption you would
38:42 make for an article that sells maybe uh
38:45 one item a week you don't know exactly
38:48 which day but usually in a week you sell
38:50 one item uh or an article where you sell
38:54 a thousand items per week so for the
38:56 article where you s th000 items per week
38:59 you could do something like a plusone
39:01 distribution right uh but uh for the
39:04 article that sells maybe one in one
39:07 every week you get it's super zero
39:10 inflated and actually the way it turns
39:12 out uh with a millions of articles in
39:15 your assortment you can say that most
39:18 articles never sell on average uh and
39:22 anyway you end up selling hundreds of
39:24 millions of items uh so uh already kept
39:28 kind of transitioning between your top
39:29 sellers and the vast amount of still
39:32 selling slow sellers uh you already find
39:35 that you need to use two
39:38 distributions that so that happens and
39:41 again Alexa right you don't have to have
39:42 the same way of solving it for all it is
39:44 possible that you like your like your
39:46 lead times you do have a bit more
39:47 observability right so you can go with
39:49 one technique and make an assumption for
39:51 the forast you don't want to take that
39:53 risk right so it really is possible that
39:55 which we did actually and you know by
39:57 for every input we approach it like in a
39:59 different way but we try to have still
40:01 that you know variance estimation
40:04 exercise accomplished or but you're bold
40:07 to say you can't that's that has a
40:11 tendency to make academically minded
40:13 people
40:15 toine that's true no so we try we try
40:18 right so I mean you can never guarantee
40:20 but basically the like you know that's
40:22 the
40:23 exercise right and sorry for the
40:26 academics if you offend them I I hope
40:28 not we love you very much all right so
40:31 uh the main conclusion is that if you
40:32 take the terministic right and it's
40:34 often a good Baseline you do find out
40:37 that you actually end up not making
40:39 yourself safe against basically you know
40:41 the unexpected of Life all the
40:42 uncertainties that onas mentioned in the
40:44 beginning right like the strikes the
40:45 pandemics the demand all type of noise
40:47 and any of your inputs if you don't take
40:49 them into account well guess what you
40:51 actually do see a very massive
40:53 difference in the final decision space
40:54 right so you can play a game you
40:56 basically you know sample or you don't
40:58 sample or basically you take the mean
41:00 forecast or you take the distributional
41:02 forecast and you start to do like the
41:03 same operation you do end up in very
41:05 different decisions right and that
41:07 decision has a final you know very
41:08 different final outcome on your
41:10 economics so the main point is that if
41:12 you go deterministic that thing actually
41:15 tells you nothing about noise right like
41:18 how how much noise is there is it high
41:19 is it low noise how much confidence you
41:21 are in your decision when you say okay I
41:23 should replenish that amount right
41:25 should I have more safety stock less SA
41:27 talk on this one um how does this
41:29 confidence evolve over time right like
41:30 the more like the further I
41:33 forecast how is it the forecast am I you
41:35 know certain about it what should I do
41:37 for that and yeah it's it's not easy
41:40 right like modeling this is not easy
41:42 modeling variance is not fun right
41:45 already modeling mean like if you want
41:47 to model mean is not easy and if on top
41:49 of that you want to model mean and
41:51 variant well good luck right that's so
41:53 that's thing but but it's possible and
41:55 that's what we try to do and we try to
41:57 keep this basically concept of end to
42:00 endend stochastic not only in the inputs
42:02 so not only on the forecast but also
42:04 take that also concept of stochasticity
42:06 in the optimization Pro process itself
42:09 so end to endend you know capturing the
42:11 variant otherwise it makes very L sense
42:12 to have you know probabilistic forecast
42:14 but you do nothing with it it's
42:16 basically pointless um so that's what
42:18 we're going to try to speak about now
42:19 and how we you know actually ended up
42:22 doing something with
42:23 it all right and I think Andreas this is
42:26 up to you right
42:27 this is where I come in hit
42:31 it cool so uh with the risk of sounding
42:34 a little bit like a broken record it's a
42:36 two-step flow right we want to optimize
42:38 the decision uh it's a policy to make
42:41 the policy you got to put something in
42:43 the policy you might have to estimate
42:44 some that all right cool so first we
42:47 build demand forecast return forecast a
42:50 model of costs uh model of lead time so
42:53 now we have either known or estimated
42:56 everything we need to stick into the
42:57 policy uh then we uh Implement a policy
43:01 optimization engine so now we're saying
43:03 okay given all of these parameters that
43:05 comes into the policy uh I need to solve
43:09 an optimization problem I need to find
43:11 the replenishment decision that given
43:13 the parameters gives me the most profit
43:17 contribution uh so uh this is all uh
43:21 nice but of course how do you get
43:24 uncertainty in there well there are two
43:26 kind of classic techniques one of them
43:29 you make a convenient distributional
43:31 assumption by all means Works um and
43:35 that way you could uh solve that
43:38 analytically in some cases uh and the
43:41 other one uh the let's say the more
43:43 pragmatic method uh you bring out the
43:45 good old mon Carlo uh toolbox and uh
43:50 actually I will say as you will see in
43:52 the in the later slides by hagop uh
43:56 Monte Carlo is is uh very attractive
43:59 these days with easy access to compute
44:01 all right so uh we made internally of
44:05 course this consider consideration
44:08 consideration ourselves and we kind of
44:10 came up with this um this uh consult
44:15 consultant level overview of the
44:17 situation uh and essentially we're
44:19 saying well so you got reinforcement
44:20 learning you got M simulation you can do
44:22 a parametric stochastic modeling and you
44:24 can do deterministic modeling and we
44:27 kind of put these into two axis we could
44:28 say what's the complexity of your
44:30 problem you're trying to solve uh and
44:32 what's the risk of the solution approach
44:36 you're taking being not feasible so
44:38 deterministic uh modeling it's uh if
44:42 your if your problem is very simple uh
44:44 it's kind of very easy to see how the
44:48 feasibility uh is is high right it's not
44:50 a big risk if you're having a simple
44:52 problem you can do some back of the
44:54 envelope calculations and you can come
44:55 up with a replenishment decision
44:57 in fact uh I would Hazard for most of
45:00 the replenishments that happen in the
45:02 world this is the way it works right you
45:04 have someone with an Excel sheet uh they
45:07 put in the factors they have some
45:08 equation uh and they come up with a
45:10 decision and then they adjust as the
45:12 world evolves so of course Very feasible
45:15 uh then you can do a parametric
45:17 stochastic modeling uh that gets you a
45:20 little bit more into the complexity
45:23 right so you might actually want to
45:24 account for some uncertainty the problem
45:27 as we discussed before with parametric
45:29 is that uh it is uh you you end up
45:32 finding that you need to use multiple
45:34 different distributions or distributions
45:35 can start becoming a liability for you
45:38 in this uh and then you look over to mon
45:42 Carlo simulation you're like well
45:43 actually the assumptions I need to make
45:45 for monticola simulations are pretty uh
45:49 pretty attractive and these days uh with
45:52 the accessibility you have to high
45:54 performance compute the cost of mol
45:56 isn't really that high anymore so I
45:59 would say this is actually almost a
46:01 somewhat of a shift in uh in the
46:03 industry as of late that which kind of
46:06 came on the back of all of the compute
46:08 we use for deep learning uh all of a
46:10 sudden you can uh put your monol
46:13 simulations on the G GPU easily right uh
46:16 which historically would have been
46:18 pretty tricky uh and then of course
46:21 reinforcement learning is a perhaps
46:24 a for this problem it is uh attractive
46:27 if you're if you're curious let's say if
46:29 you're academically minded you're uh
46:32 seeing this problem you might say yeah
46:33 reinforcement learning would be this
46:35 would be an excellent training ground
46:36 for reinforcement learning which is true
46:39 uh if your if your goal is to uh
46:43 practice reinforcement learning this is
46:44 an excellent problem to practice it for
46:46 if your goal is to make uh great
46:49 replenishments uh reinforcement learning
46:51 might be a little bit too data hungry
46:52 and a little bit not feasible especially
46:55 once you're coming into modeling a
46:56 complex
46:57 domain uh so with that uh you'll see
47:01 here uh in our case we're opting for
47:03 monol simulation very attractive for us
47:06 uh so what's happening here right so
47:08 we're estimating to the left demand
47:10 forecast the return lead times the uh
47:14 lead time of replenishment we're looking
47:16 at the economics of uh the the decision
47:19 that needs to be taken uh
47:22 you essentially uh uh take these
47:25 parameters put them into to your Monte
47:27 Carlo simulation and then uh you uh
47:32 essentially explore the decision space
47:34 and for each potential replenishment you
47:36 can estimate what roughly the profit
47:39 contribution should look like or the
47:40 even what the distribution of Co profit
47:43 contribution will look like uh and so
47:46 then you might want to be a little bit
47:48 robust the absolute simplest technique
47:50 for being robust here this is really the
47:54 absolute simplest way instead of
47:56 optimizing the expected value you can
47:58 optimize a quanti uh and then uh this
48:01 you essentially have from a purely
48:03 programming standpoint you know how a
48:05 function multicol simulation
48:08 parenthesis uh my uh my proposed
48:12 replenishment I get an objective value
48:15 oh the Apple sent balloons I think I can
48:18 do again yeah oh go back go back and
48:21 then of course this is a perfect
48:23 formulation for uh a optimization solver
48:27 right so there are plenty of good
48:30 actually gradient free blackbox
48:32 optimizers usually the con the
48:34 limitation with those is that you need
48:36 to have a somewhat well behaved loss
48:38 surface and you need to have a uh a low
48:42 dimensional decision space now thanks to
48:45 the inventory policies hago spoke about
48:47 before we do have a small decision space
48:50 uh so uh we can actually do this so how
48:53 does this look in reality now hagab
48:55 alluded to this before we end up with a
48:56 fairly nice decision space so if you
48:59 look and I think the best part here is
49:01 the top left one right so here you see
49:03 in color the objective uh purple is you
49:07 make more money yellow is you make less
49:09 money uh and uh for the initial
49:13 replenishment quantity q0 on the y- axis
49:17 and then t0 the time of the initial
49:20 replenishment uh on the x-axis and you
49:23 can see that actually the objective
49:24 surface is very well behaved uh this is
49:26 is if I don't think I think I can see
49:29 somewhat of a non-convexity but this is
49:30 certainly monotonically increasing so
49:34 easy enough to optimize with a with a
49:37 gradient fre Optimizer the rest of these
49:40 you can imagine I'm just scanning over
49:42 the decision space putting constraints
49:44 on the remaining parameters and seeing
49:46 what the remaining parameters come it's
49:49 an interesting exercise to look into
49:50 this I'm mindful of time right now
49:55 yes uh you want to do these H up or yes
49:58 I can do so basically the question is
50:00 okay so H up like or and so you
50:02 mentioned that you know you like you
50:03 like like you're sampling right like
50:04 you're samping and like distributions
50:07 how do you even actually get your
50:09 initial input to sample from right so
50:11 this is then the question of how you
50:12 forecast your publicistic you know
50:14 inputs so there are many ways right like
50:16 um you have basically B methods or
50:18 frequen methods but we want to focus on
50:20 the frequen method because they are the
50:21 most common ones specifically about you
50:23 know how you basically learn your
50:24 distribution parameters or how you learn
50:26 directly quantiles to sample from the
50:29 first thing is basically this is what
50:30 you mentioned Alexi right so you
50:32 basically have to make assumptions on
50:33 your like distribution around like the
50:35 forecast let's say you say I want my
50:37 demand to be following a Deo
50:39 distribution around the value or a Pon
50:41 then you actually end up learning the
50:42 parameters of that distribution right
50:44 either mu Sigma or Lambda for theum and
50:46 you say I want to basically learn this
50:49 with my demand forecast or my return
50:50 forecast on historical data doing uh
50:53 basically Lo like Lo like
50:55 maximization and then once you have like
50:57 your distribution parameters then you
50:58 have your parameters right you basically
51:00 just take a you know like your
51:01 distribution you put in the parameters
51:03 and then you sample from that value in a
51:04 random way that's the first way of doing
51:06 it the big disadvantage is that you have
51:08 to make assumptions about distribution
51:10 and that's never guaranteed that you
51:11 know it is going to work the second way
51:14 of doing it is you're like okay I I
51:16 don't want to make any assumptions I
51:17 want to learn directly the Quantas of
51:19 the distribution right so you then
51:20 actually end up learning the quantal and
51:22 this is like many methods and one of the
51:24 best way to doing it is using the
51:25 quantal LW right so I already mentioned
51:27 about this in the demand forecast series
51:29 but basically like it's the same content
51:30 right so once you have your quantal
51:31 Matrix so you let's say you forecast
51:33 every fifth quantal 5 10 15 25 until
51:36 like 95 then you have a matrix of 20 or
51:39 you know 50 Quantas or whatever Quantas
51:42 and then you can just you know sample
51:44 the like the quantal index following
51:45 like uniform distribution and then just
51:47 take that value in the in the in the in
51:50 the simulation so instead of samping
51:52 from like like a distribution with
51:53 parameters you basically sample directly
51:54 from the Quant as following like you
51:56 uniform distribution more of them work
51:59 um it really depends on you know if you
52:01 really want to be adventurous on making
52:03 an assumption about the distribution or
52:06 not um but both of them areed definitely
52:10 and the question is okay so you told us
52:12 the problem the solution that you found
52:15 the sampling and the multicol
52:16 experimentation and like basically how
52:18 do you you know scale this up
52:20 because I was just thinking like we
52:22 don't have a lot of time and we have
52:24 quite a few questions um so what do you
52:27 think like do you think you'll I will
52:30 make
52:31 [Music]
52:33 it questions two minutes okay maximum
52:37 basically like like the slides and it
52:38 took much longer than thought but I
52:39 think this is this is basically like the
52:41 good thing right like like like the good
52:42 news is that and the conclusion of this
52:45 is that um basically multicolor
52:48 simulation has been seen really like a
52:50 blocker right for many where they try to
52:53 go up and do like crazy mathematical
52:55 modeling and then they validate the
52:56 modeling with with simulations but they
52:58 don't take the simulation as a first
53:00 solution because it's expensive to
53:01 compute right let's say you're doing
53:03 like a GRE search with npy for one
53:05 article that took for us 45 seconds with
53:08 you know 2,000 or 3,000 like uh demand
53:11 trajectories from basically 45 seconds
53:14 we manag using accter simulations with
53:17 Numba and Intel svml and using Cy and
53:21 Sho as Optimizer we ended up actually
53:23 bringing that value to 200 milliseconds
53:26 so B basically the entire engineering
53:27 work was okay how can we make this
53:28 simulation possible so that we don't
53:30 even have to make any assumption about
53:32 like the mathematical but let's just
53:33 take the most realistic model which is
53:36 the simulation where really we allow the
53:38 complexity of our word in it and there
53:40 you can put anything in your simulation
53:42 and that was basically possible text
53:43 Numba you can use Jack you can use any
53:46 like any compiler but you basically have
53:48 to get out of pure python you have to
53:49 find a way to compile like your code and
53:51 you have Solutions and this is
53:53 what now the questions yes
53:59 um so you finished yes I'm so number for
54:03 the win right or number yeah really
54:07 awesome tool so you showed that you
54:10 optimize for quantiles and in particular
54:13 I think in one of the slides I think
54:14 Andreas was showing that it was q75
54:17 right so you optimize you try to
54:19 optimize for this cost quantile right
54:22 yep um does it mean that um you're
54:26 little bit more let's say pessimistic
54:28 and you replenish sooner rather than
54:30 later to minimize costs yes we want to
54:33 be like Rovers yeah so we're a little
54:35 bit pessimistic I'll say but it's not
54:37 always working out to sooner so that
54:39 depends on the order economics so if uh
54:42 if you stand to lose more from Overstock
54:45 then being pessimistic means that you
54:47 replenish less whereas if you stand to
54:49 lose more from uh lost sale being
54:52 pessimistic means more so it's a little
54:54 bit more complex but roughly that's the
54:56 way to think about it s five here is
54:58 just a number we pulled out of thin air
55:01 actually what we're
55:02 using and and and what forget that we
55:04 have an actual human using this tool
55:06 right like the human put some of the
55:07 parameters and the human there's always
55:09 a chance that the human makes a mistake
55:10 so we also want to some input mistakes
55:13 MH and um so when it comes to humans
55:17 operators like how important uh ASL are
55:20 like how you mentioned that you can do
55:22 it pretty fast uh and being fast like
55:26 how does it impact your
55:28 models so if you do I mean basically you
55:32 have to um you know so it the like the
55:36 problem is in the optimizer right so
55:38 because when you have like an Optimizer
55:40 here for example um you have to make a
55:43 choice right like the best solution is
55:45 obviously like if you do like a GRE
55:46 search or you do like Brute Force you go
55:48 to the entire space that's the safest
55:50 but is that really like realistic right
55:51 so you just have to make a choice either
55:52 like buing Optimizer either some hyper
55:54 parameter Optimizer that use from even
55:57 machine learning or like like a global
55:59 you know black bloock Optimizer so this
56:02 is where you basically lose something
56:04 because they have to sample and the
56:06 question is how well can you sample and
56:08 compute or not derivative so in this
56:09 case it's derivative free how can you
56:11 basically represent with as Minal points
56:13 as possible your entire space and then
56:16 find that you know minimal point so
56:18 that's where you have to lose uh some
56:20 basic risk sometimes it might not always
56:22 converge but that's a risk you have to
56:24 take that you know if I want to work for
56:25 like an average and which you check I
56:28 have to make you know make it you run it
56:30 for all the Articles right for all the
56:33 SKS yeah so when for example the user
56:36 like in real time puts a parameter let's
56:38 say they update the price of of like
56:41 like the average uh average production
56:44 rate right they say I sell a product and
56:46 and and average I pay 25% to buy or
56:49 build that product then basically we
56:51 have to update the entire
56:51 recommendations for all of their catalog
56:54 and this happens in an as sync way and
56:56 every second
56:58 matters and there are quite a few
57:01 questions from Adrian and there is one
57:03 question from Rona but we unfortunately
57:05 cannot cover them because we need to
57:08 wrap up soon so um hop Andreas is it
57:12 okay if people can contact you directly
57:15 through Linkedin or some other means of
57:17 communication absolutely H go to the
57:20 last slide yes the last slide
57:23 is this one okay okay okay so take a
57:27 picture everyone uh I mean not with your
57:30 phone but a screenshot
57:33 and this is how you can contact hope and
57:37 and check the the first link also
57:40 important and I want to thank you
57:42 Andreas hob for being here for
57:44 presenting that was very interesting
57:46 talk and I expected nothing else from
57:49 your previous talks um so I knew that
57:53 this one would be really great it's
57:55 packed with a lot of stuff I learned
57:57 quite a few new things I had no idea
57:59 like how actually these things work in
58:01 practice so thanks a lot and thanks
58:04 everyone for attending the talk too so I
58:07 hope everyone learned something new
58:09 today see everyone thanks Alex yeah have
58:12 a great evening and yeah tell hi to your
58:16 son and wife you spoke in both French
58:19 and German right I think there was like
58:21 I was thinking like which language did
58:23 he speak like
58:26 Alex sometimes like we speak five
58:28 languages at the same time I'm like
58:29 Jesus I have to do something about
58:31 it now go speak your
58:34 languages yeah okay and I'll go speak
58:38 mine okay
