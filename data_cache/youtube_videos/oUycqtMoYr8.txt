1:00 yeah i think i'm
1:01 ready
1:02 are you ready as well i am ready
1:06 okay hi everyone
1:08 this week we'll talk about the work of
1:10 data scientists and expectations from
1:12 them we have a special guest today misra
1:15 and misra is a data scientist and
1:17 content creator and after working as a
1:19 data scientist for many many different
1:21 companies
1:22 she decided to teach
1:25 to create your own platform for teaching
1:27 data scientists so maybe you heard about
1:29 this website so you want to be a data
1:32 scientist and
1:34 now we finally met the person behind
1:36 this website
1:37 so yeah and now i think you work as a
1:40 developer advocate at assembly ai
1:42 right
1:44 yes yes that's correct so i still do my
1:46 i still work on my platform and my
1:48 youtube channel but i also create
1:50 content for assembly ai
1:52 okay yeah so welcome
1:55 thank you it's great to be here
1:58 before we go into our main topic let's
2:00 start with your background can you tell
2:02 us about your career journey so far
2:05 sure
2:06 so i
2:08 started in this whole thing
2:10 when i did my bachelor's in computer
2:13 science even though i did not really
2:15 know what i was getting myself into
2:17 and
2:18 through the courses that i took during
2:20 that time i realized that i kind of like
2:22 artificial intelligence and i felt like
2:24 okay this thing is actually going to be
2:26 the future of data science or generally
2:28 the world uh and back then it wasn't
2:31 really top of mind in the world and you
2:33 know ai was just starting to mature
2:36 and i decided to do a masters also in
2:39 that area
2:41 and i did my masters in big data
2:42 engineering uh and
2:45 during that i started taking projects
2:47 doing internships i kind of ended up at
2:49 ibm and that's where i also started my
2:51 first job as a data scientist and
2:53 through that i did a lot of projects in
2:54 many different companies because maybe
2:56 the listeners would know and when you're
2:58 a consultant they sent you to different
3:00 companies to do projects basically
3:02 um but yeah after a while i decided that
3:05 the consultancy life is not really for
3:07 me i was not really getting a lot of
3:08 excitement out of it so then i decided
3:10 to join a startup working as a
3:13 data scientist and there it was actually
3:16 really fun with a lot of good work but
3:18 after a while i was like okay now i feel
3:21 like i am ready to build my own thing so
3:23 i completely focused on my work as a
3:26 content creator uh through blog posts
3:29 podcasts and a youtube channel and i
3:32 basically sell online courses through
3:34 that platform too and everything else is
3:36 kind of um
3:37 educating people and educating the
3:39 community
3:40 going to that goal
3:42 and uh yeah so that's what i've been
3:44 doing for the last couple of years and
3:46 recently i joined assembly ai uh as a
3:49 content creator um
3:51 you should go check it out it's a great
3:52 company uh we're building a really nice
3:55 product there too it's a speech to text
3:56 api and on our youtube channel for
3:59 assembling the ai2 we make weekly
4:01 content on generally deep learning
4:03 machine learning and
4:05 python tutorials in general
4:07 so yeah that's where i am right now
4:10 how did you end up becoming a developer
4:12 advocate i guess because you
4:15 understood you really like creating
4:17 content right and that's why
4:19 yeah i think developer advocate is the
4:21 kind of role that you do this for living
4:23 right
4:24 yeah you know how they say those who
4:26 can't do teach so i guess i did not
4:29 really want to do data's high-end state
4:31 today
4:32 the projects were fun the ones that i
4:34 worked on but i uh during ibm for
4:37 example we took on this project to
4:40 give trainings to a very big company i
4:42 don't think i'm allowed to say the name
4:44 but it's like a multinational company
4:46 that is all over the world and
4:48 i for them i started preparing data
4:51 science educational material and also um
4:54 give that training to them over a couple
4:56 of days to like 300 people and i
4:58 realized that i actually kind of like
5:00 teaching people
5:02 through what i learned also at the
5:03 projects and the projects that i was a
5:05 part of at ibm and decided you know why
5:08 don't i do this online and i was getting
5:11 a lot of questions from people who
5:13 wanted to become data scientists asking
5:16 me like how can i become a data
5:17 scientist what should i learn and after
5:19 a while i actually got tired of
5:21 answering everyone one by one so i was
5:23 like i'm just going to write a blog post
5:24 about this and then it kind of like
5:26 started that way and then one blog post
5:28 led to another and before you know it i
5:30 was making videos so that's how it all
5:32 happened
5:34 and then i guess you also at some point
5:36 decided to do this professionally by
5:39 becoming a developer advocate right
5:41 exactly so
5:42 i mean for developer advocate part came
5:44 very recently i was just kind of making
5:47 videos uh to promote my own platform but
5:49 assembly ai found me online and they
5:51 were like we really like your style why
5:53 don't you do this for us and i was like
5:55 okay
5:57 i think this is a common story i heard
6:00 this story
6:01 quite a few times
6:02 i guess because i interview people like
6:04 you who are also
6:06 quite into content creation and the
6:08 study they shared is
6:10 pretty common a company notices them and
6:12 says hey why don't you do this for us
6:14 full-time
6:15 yeah that's that's that's the great
6:17 thing about kind of building something
6:19 in public right you really put your
6:20 skills out there and
6:22 people see you people realize what
6:24 you're doing and then that really opens
6:26 a lot of doors
6:28 okay well coming back to our main topic
6:31 data scientists at work maybe there are
6:33 some parallels to data developer
6:36 advocates but yeah you've been a data
6:38 scientist quite recently right so coming
6:40 back to this topic
6:42 so
6:43 how do you
6:44 usually answer your question well
6:46 imagine you're a data scientist not a
6:47 developer so how do you answer a
6:49 question what do you do at work to your
6:51 friends and relatives
6:54 well that is one of the trickiest things
6:55 they can ask me
6:57 because i have no idea how to explain it
6:59 to someone who is not tech savvy at all
7:01 like my mom for example
7:03 um
7:04 my very recent resolution was to just
7:07 tell them you know these ads you know
7:10 sometimes you search for something and
7:11 then you start seeing ads about it
7:12 everywhere it's kind of like that
7:15 that's what i kind of told them recently
7:18 to make it more understandable but
7:20 generally i try to say
7:23 you know we collect a lot of data
7:25 through your phone when you go on a
7:26 website they're tracking where you look
7:28 at where you click how much you engage
7:31 with their content and all of this data
7:34 and more data is being collected and
7:36 someone needs to do something with it
7:38 and i know it sounds still very vague
7:41 but generally that's what i tell people
7:43 so i am the person who deals with the
7:45 data and who is the professional that
7:47 knows how to
7:49 uh create value out of it
7:52 yeah my son recently asked me well not
7:54 recently it was a year ago but i still
7:57 remember this as if it was today he
7:59 asked me
8:00 what is data science and i was like uh
8:02 what
8:03 what do i say now
8:05 so i was like it took me completely by
8:07 surprise i didn't know what to answer so
8:09 eventually he watches a lot of youtube
8:11 so i say you see these recommendations
8:13 on youtube so this is kind of similar to
8:16 i'm not really doing recommendations but
8:17 the concept is clear very similar right
8:20 it's uh depending on what you like we
8:23 show something else but now he thinks
8:25 that i'm actually doing these
8:27 recommendations for him of course
8:29 yeah it's easier to explain it to people
8:31 on an application because yeah it's such
8:32 a wake area and you can do so much so
8:35 many different things with it that yeah
8:37 when you give one example kind of
8:39 confuses people kind of makes it a bit
8:40 more tangible i guess but yeah it's
8:42 really tricky to describe
8:45 you have a blog post about this don't
8:47 you
8:48 mm-hmm
8:49 yeah it's generally like
8:51 what is the work product of data science
8:54 like what do we produce
8:57 yeah so what do we data scientists
8:58 produce at work
9:00 yeah so i actually took a lot of
9:03 different roles in a lot of different
9:04 projects and that's how i got to
9:06 experience this a little bit myself
9:08 because with every project we needed to
9:10 deliver something different and also
9:12 through the podcast i've met a lot of
9:14 different data scientists
9:15 machine learning engineers data analysts
9:18 and i also heard from them what kind of
9:20 things they produce
9:22 and it's basically
9:24 a wide variety of things so one thing
9:27 you can produce for example is a trained
9:28 model maybe that's like the simplest
9:30 thing if you're a data scientist that
9:32 works with machine learning or deep
9:33 learning maybe all they want from you is
9:36 a model that can produce uh accurate
9:38 results right so that's the simplest a
9:41 possibility or maybe they will want you
9:43 to create a complete pipeline where
9:46 they will constantly add more data and
9:48 then it will produce something this
9:50 could be
9:51 anything some results maybe some
9:54 information
9:55 recommendations could also be like the
9:57 youtube recommendations you mentioned
10:00 um
10:01 another thing could be that maybe they
10:03 just want you to
10:04 do a presentation to them and that
10:06 that's what i did most of the time even
10:08 you know it said like okay i'm a data
10:10 scientist and then generally people
10:12 think data scientists work with machine
10:14 learning there are times where you don't
10:15 even need to do any machine learning
10:17 whatsoever so what you do is you analyze
10:20 the data and you present your results
10:22 and that's actually good enough
10:25 or it could be that you know you prepare
10:26 a report and then you give it to someone
10:29 like a manager who needs it like the
10:31 swamp project i did for a bank uh they
10:34 just did not they had some like a jumble
10:36 of data they could not understand it and
10:39 my job was to
10:41 understand the data and then make a
10:43 report out of it of what is going on and
10:45 why so they knew something was going on
10:47 something was going wrong but they did
10:49 not know how and they had the data but
10:51 the data was so confusing they needed
10:54 like a person to full-time focus on this
10:57 um another one
10:59 that you did at ibm or like in general
11:01 like this is something maybe what
11:03 consultants tend to do more often
11:06 like creating presentations and reports
11:08 definitely yeah definitely so it's yeah
11:11 so we have many different ways how you
11:13 can be a data scientist right and that's
11:15 also something i say a lot on my website
11:18 when you want to become a data scientist
11:19 you should really think about what kind
11:21 of work you want to do
11:23 if you end up becoming a consultant data
11:26 scientist then what you're going to do
11:28 most of the time is a lot about like
11:30 reporting on presentations or creating a
11:32 dashboard for example so you're
11:34 completely right about that
11:35 um and that was something i did during
11:37 my consultancy years also
11:40 and i guess the other the other things
11:42 you mentioned like trained model a
11:44 pipeline pipeline is more something
11:48 something you create more often as a i
11:50 don't know as a data scientist working
11:52 in a product company like at a startup
11:54 no definitely yeah i think uh being an
11:57 in-house data scientist comes with
12:00 a bit more of a
12:02 responsibility so you probably become a
12:05 bit more of like the expert in the
12:07 company depends on the size of the
12:09 company of course
12:10 especially if it's a small company you
12:12 really end up becoming the go-to person
12:14 to build all of this some companies have
12:16 separate engineering teams so you would
12:18 only have to create a model and then
12:20 give it to them and they deal with it
12:21 and some companies don't so you would
12:23 have to create the whole pipeline and so
12:25 then requires a bit more of engineering
12:27 and devops skills too right uh so yeah
12:30 these things really
12:31 matter i think in terms of like knowing
12:33 these things and this varieties and this
12:36 whole range is important to choose the
12:38 right position that's why i try to point
12:40 this out as much as i can when i uh meet
12:43 a new person who wants to become a data
12:45 scientist
12:47 so we have like you said it's important
12:49 to think what kind of work you want to
12:51 do to decide what kind of data scientist
12:53 you want to be right so one thing could
12:55 be
12:56 you work at a product company like
12:58 in-house data scientist that's one thing
13:01 another thing is a consultant data
13:02 science consultant consultant
13:05 is there something else like is there a
13:06 third type of data scientist um yeah i
13:09 think not in that sense but you can be a
13:12 freelancer right always you can be a
13:15 separate consultant for example
13:17 but i think also in inside companies
13:20 like if you're an in-house data
13:21 scientist the team matters too you can
13:24 be
13:25 one data scientist in a team that is
13:27 building your product that would come
13:29 with different responsibilities you can
13:31 also be in in-house data scientists but
13:36 you could be in the data science team so
13:37 you would be just one of the many data
13:39 scientists that would also come with
13:41 different responsibilities also depends
13:43 on how they assign you to different
13:45 projects are you working solo on
13:47 projects are you working the bigger team
13:49 like i said that is that includes
13:51 engineers or not so all of these things
13:54 um makes every data scientist in the
13:56 world a little bit unique actually and
13:59 that's why i think it's so important to
14:00 ask questions to the company that you're
14:02 applying to to kind of fully understand
14:05 what is waiting for you on the other
14:06 side
14:08 and with all different
14:10 you know ways to work as a data
14:12 scientist
14:14 yeah actually this brings us a bit to
14:16 the to the other thing i wanted to talk
14:18 about because there was one article that
14:21 i from you that i really liked it was
14:23 about
14:24 unreasonable and reasonable expectations
14:26 from data scientists so i wanted to talk
14:28 a little bit about that
14:30 and uh
14:32 yeah and there
14:34 like uh maybe you can give us a gist
14:37 about this that article so what did you
14:39 write about
14:41 so basically this is something i felt
14:44 myself when i was first starting and
14:46 that's why i thought maybe you know
14:48 other people there are other people out
14:49 there who feel the same way so i want to
14:51 share my thoughts and feelings about
14:53 that so basically
14:56 there is this general air in the world
14:58 of ai especially if you're a data
15:00 scientist you're a practitioner that you
15:02 really need to be on top of the latest
15:04 developments and everything that is
15:06 happening in the world of ai
15:08 and
15:09 to use a very gen z
15:11 genzette word i think it's toxic
15:14 in a way that really makes people feel
15:16 like they are not enough and they are
15:18 not trying hard enough even if they are
15:20 working really hard and they know what
15:22 they're doing and basically in that
15:24 article i was talking about that is that
15:26 does not have to be you
15:27 and you do not have to be reading the
15:29 latest articles knowing about the latest
15:32 uh innovations or the models that are
15:34 coming out you don't have to understand
15:36 how they work uh and you're okay by if
15:39 you're just doing your work well enough
15:43 but how do you personally stay up to
15:46 date in uh like with all the
15:48 developments in the ai
15:50 well basically i don't i don't really
15:52 put extra effort into this
15:54 uh there are a bunch of people i follow
15:57 on twitter for example but i don't
15:59 follow them just to hear about the news
16:01 you know i just generally like their
16:02 attitude towards life and they happen to
16:04 be working in
16:06 google brain or deep mind for example
16:09 and uh
16:10 then you kind of like hear about those
16:11 things there
16:12 and well currently i kind of have to
16:15 because i'm creating content and the
16:16 content is mostly about like the latest
16:18 developments in ai so that's part of my
16:20 job but before when i was a data
16:22 scientist i basically did not put that
16:24 much effort into it because
16:26 i know that what i'm supposed to do is
16:30 my work and learning about gpt3 and how
16:34 it works does not affect my work one bit
16:36 it's cool but i think it's more of a
16:38 hobby than uh being necessary to be a
16:42 data scientist so that's why
16:44 the answer to your question is i don't
16:46 really
16:48 because especially when it comes to nlp
16:50 so you mentioned is gpt3 there are so
16:52 many things happening
16:55 there so first like you start with
16:56 transformers then i don't know like
16:59 other things all the way to this gpt3
17:02 and every time i open twitter there is
17:04 something new about this and it feels
17:06 like this fear like
17:08 this former right hero fear of missing
17:10 out like if i don't jump on this nlp
17:13 like something will happen i will become
17:15 i don't know useless because exactly
17:18 yeah obsolete exactly yeah uh
17:21 so how about it's kind of funny
17:24 it's kind of funny because
17:25 the people who worked work on models
17:28 that big are i don't know in total it's
17:30 probably 50 people or something right
17:32 it's not even that many and they're like
17:34 hundreds of thousands of data scientists
17:37 in the world obviously not all of them
17:39 are working on this but somehow some
17:41 people are just more interested in it
17:43 and that's kind of part of their life
17:45 and it's their hobby and that's why they
17:46 spend time on this and you know it's
17:49 kind of okay for you to not have it as a
17:51 hobby you can maybe you like playing
17:53 basketball maybe you like going on walks
17:55 and that's fine too like just because
17:57 you're a data scientist you do not have
17:58 to have a different lifestyle
18:01 yeah because i think these applications
18:03 that go like things that go viral on
18:05 twitter there most of them are like jaw
18:07 dropping because you see it's and it's
18:10 like wow i can write some text or i can
18:13 draw a picture and then this gpt3
18:15 creates a website from like i think
18:17 there was something i don't know if it's
18:19 gpt3 or not but i think you just draw a
18:22 sketch and this thing
18:24 creates a valid react and html call from
18:26 this and it looks nice
18:28 and it's like wow
18:30 can you do this like is it real like is
18:32 it not fake
18:34 and then this is actually a website
18:35 where you can play with this and check
18:36 that it is actually real and
18:39 yeah i think most of these things they
18:41 have this effect and you think okay like
18:44 i'm not using anything like this at work
18:46 i don't know how it works
18:48 and then maybe in half a year like and
18:51 it seems like because there is so much
18:52 buzz on twitter right it seems like
18:54 everyone
18:55 is talking about everyone knows this and
18:57 it's just me who doesn't understand this
18:59 yeah right no yeah i think it's also
19:01 it's just social media right like i
19:04 think for
19:05 uh you could say for young girls they
19:07 look at all the perfect looking
19:09 influencers and they feel bad and i
19:11 guess for us it's the influencers in the
19:13 ai world or the technical world and we
19:15 look at them and we're like oops you
19:17 know these guys know so much but like i
19:20 like what you said about how it creates
19:21 like a jaw-dropping
19:23 reaction because that's kind of the
19:25 point of the content and now that i've
19:27 been working in content creation for a
19:29 while i understand this a bit better
19:31 because the whole point of creating
19:33 content is to surprise you shock you or
19:36 get some sort of emotion out of you and
19:39 that's why those people are working on
19:40 that that's why i am that's why i made a
19:42 video about dolly you know it just came
19:44 out everyone was shocked everyone was
19:46 really impressed so i was like okay let
19:47 me capitalize on this make a video
19:50 explaining how it works and people it's
19:52 going to be useful of course but at the
19:53 same time it's going to be uh you know
19:56 educational and people will be like oh
19:58 wow i need to learn about this someone
20:00 made a video so that means everyone
20:02 knows so let me also get in this
20:03 bandwagon but it was actually fine like
20:06 i did not know anything about how delhi
20:07 to work before i made that video and in
20:09 one week i learned and then i made a
20:11 video about it but it doesn't mean that
20:12 everyone in the world knows but that
20:14 unfortunately there is a delusion like
20:16 the community knows so you have to be a
20:18 part of it
20:21 how does dali work maybe you can tell
20:24 but those who have a fear of missing out
20:26 because i do i see these awesome
20:28 pictures like i think the way it works
20:31 like as a black box you give it some
20:34 prompt like a text a piece of text and
20:36 it generates like nine images that looks
20:39 creepily realistic
20:41 yeah exactly it creates a high
20:43 resolution image from captions basically
20:46 and yeah and the images are
20:49 surprisingly realistic and it's not the
20:52 only thing it can do it can generate
20:53 images from captions uh it can also add
20:56 items uh to images so let's say you have
20:59 a photo of
21:01 living room an empty living room you can
21:03 add couches you can say add couch and
21:04 then we'll add different types of
21:06 couches in different locations or if you
21:08 give it an image that already exists
21:10 like salvador dali's painting with the
21:13 melting clocks it can create variations
21:16 of it and how it does it is basically
21:18 understanding what is essential
21:20 in this painting or in this image only
21:23 keeping that and changing the
21:25 unnecessary or relevant details like uh
21:28 how the background looks a little bit uh
21:31 where the clocks are located so trivial
21:33 details are changed but the actual
21:35 essence of the image is preserved so
21:38 those are some of the things that it can
21:39 do
21:40 yeah wow like i cannot imagine how much
21:44 like
21:47 works
21:48 like all these formulas there they are
21:51 just scary and i cannot imagine what it
21:53 looks like for for things like dale like
21:56 it must be
21:58 well actually
22:00 so deli 2 itself
22:02 is not that
22:03 confusing because it is based on this
22:06 model called diffusion models and i'm
22:08 actually working right now on making a
22:10 video on how diffusion models work that
22:12 is scary that
22:14 it is taking me a lot of work to
22:16 actually understand how they work yeah
22:17 but the only two is basically a spin on
22:19 the fusion models and the fusion models
22:21 have been around for a while uh so you
22:23 know some of these big models are
22:25 actually they're kind of like
22:26 combination of previously made models or
22:29 technologies or kind of putting a spin
22:31 on them trying a different way so
22:33 sometimes it's even like easier than you
22:35 would expect too
22:37 but
22:38 i think i have now fear of missing out
22:41 afterwards yeah
22:43 oh wrong effect
22:46 yeah
22:47 you said that
22:48 there is
22:49 you know it's just
22:52 a work on top of the existing work that
22:54 is simple
22:56 oh i don't know this job
22:58 yeah so it's basically my job to know
23:00 these things and before i started
23:01 working as a content creator i also did
23:04 not know these things and honestly i
23:06 also didn't care that much because
23:08 most of these works even though they're
23:10 cool
23:11 they do not have immediate applications
23:13 in real life like in with dolly too that
23:16 what they're saying is we want this to
23:17 be
23:18 a way for humans to understand how
23:20 machines think and how machines create
23:22 that's all great it's like a noble uh
23:25 you know goal to have but at the same
23:27 time no one is ever going to use it like
23:30 okay in an artistic entertainment way it
23:32 is being used right now but
23:34 uh like we do not have to panic just yet
23:38 you know i think there needs to be some
23:40 new developments and we need to see how
23:42 we can actually apply this in real world
23:44 and it's kind of going to like trickle
23:45 down to us normal data scientists
23:48 after a while
23:50 so i guess what you're saying is if you
23:52 work as a data scientist at a
23:55 company
23:56 there is no immediate application of
23:58 this thing it all looks cool but there
24:00 is no way you can integrate into your
24:02 product this thing yeah but the dahle 2
24:05 uh case specifically i mean i know gpc3
24:08 is being used uh
24:10 in companies because it you know
24:12 generates natural language and that is
24:14 kind of useful i know there are some
24:16 apps out there that use it but with the
24:18 specific case of dolly too and generally
24:21 image generation i think is kind of like
24:23 kind of experimental just kind of having
24:25 fun i feel like
24:27 but when we talk about other things like
24:29 all this we talked about transformers
24:32 gpt3
24:33 that
24:34 does have applications in
24:37 in real life
24:38 no definitely but when you think about
24:40 it so these models need so much data and
24:43 computing power that a average startup
24:46 is not going to be able to afford
24:47 training them so
24:49 they are being used by companies and and
24:52 assembly ai they are also doing deep
24:54 learning research and using advanced
24:56 deep learning techniques right for
24:57 speech recognition uh but
25:00 it requires a very seriously capable
25:02 deep learning team most of which are phd
25:05 graduates and a lot of money to train
25:08 these models so
25:10 if you're working as a data scientist at
25:12 a startup um that does very minimal
25:14 machine learning you know decision trees
25:16 xg boosts and everything
25:18 chances are you are never going to use
25:21 it
25:22 and there is not really much
25:24 use i think worrying about not knowing
25:27 about them
25:29 and i guess
25:31 you kind of answered that it's it's okay
25:33 not to be up to date always but are
25:36 there cases when
25:38 you kind of should be up to date
25:41 sure i think it all depends on your goal
25:43 if you are not happy with where you are
25:45 what kind of work you do and you
25:48 see yourself somewhere else in the
25:50 future you should definitely go learn
25:51 more of these skills if you want to get
25:53 into deep learning
25:55 if you don't want to let's say in your
25:57 current work you're doing more like data
25:59 analysis you're providing reports and
26:01 presentations and that's not what you
26:02 want to do
26:03 obviously that's that will be a great
26:05 investment of your time to go and learn
26:07 how these models work and really
26:09 understand them
26:11 but other than that if you're happy with
26:12 where you are and you don't really want
26:14 to
26:15 change the type of work that you do then
26:17 i don't think there is really much need
26:21 i guess you also need to focus on
26:22 specific area right so it's not like
26:25 whatever is hottest now on twitter but
26:27 more like okay what do i want to do now
26:30 they want to work more i don't know
26:31 let's say with recommender systems and
26:33 then you go and check
26:36 i don't know papers about recommender
26:38 systems or textbooks right exactly
26:40 instead of
26:41 instead of oh there is this gpd3 or i
26:44 don't know gpt4
26:46 let's
26:47 see how it works let's try to train it
26:49 right no exactly yeah exactly so if you
26:52 it's kind of like being a research as a
26:53 researcher at that point i think if
26:55 you're going to try to build and
26:57 optimize those models you're going to
26:59 need a lot of experience and that means
27:02 that you're going to have to make these
27:03 things your life if you want to work in
27:05 nlp you have to focus on nlp if you want
27:07 to specialize in something else like
27:09 computer vision you have to specialize
27:11 on something else and i think even in
27:12 those areas you still have
27:15 niches that you can really specialize in
27:17 so
27:18 yeah i i don't think it's possible to
27:20 really be a deep learning generalist
27:22 like with machine learning it's a bit
27:23 easier just you can be a generalist
27:25 person you know you can
27:27 learn to deal with different types of
27:28 data and different uh industries but i
27:31 think with deep learning
27:32 it is quite specialized and you have to
27:34 make it your life
27:38 and
27:40 also i think what
27:42 helps me personally like
27:45 to stay away from all these buzz in
27:47 twitter but if i still want to be a bit
27:49 up to date
27:50 so what helps me is this
27:53 industry conferences
27:55 something like for example in berlin
27:56 next week there is a conference called
27:59 buzzwords berlin buzzwords so this is
28:02 it's more like an engineering data
28:04 science conference but people talk about
28:07 applications of data science so they
28:09 talk about their specific use cases and
28:11 let's say how the
28:13 scale is to their workloads to their
28:16 application to their particular use
28:18 cases how they tweak the papers for
28:20 example they take a paper they couldn't
28:22 implement this what how they ended up
28:24 actually using this
28:25 so i think to me personally this looks
28:28 more valuable and useful and consumable
28:32 because i cannot understand papers like
28:35 when i read the paper it's to be like
28:38 i don't know too
28:39 too complex right so because they are
28:41 also written in such a language that
28:43 more academic so you need to get used to
28:46 this type of language
28:47 but these conferences they're usually
28:49 made by people from industry
28:51 and they are aimed
28:53 at people in the industry so i think
28:56 i think they are more useful but of
28:58 course there are not many conferences
28:59 you can go and visit in one year
29:02 still i think this is a good yeah i
29:04 think that you make a really good point
29:06 i think it makes a lot more sense to
29:08 also have these personal relationships
29:10 with people too because you know
29:13 companies of course release papers but
29:16 at the same time these are companies
29:18 that are trying to make money so
29:19 obviously they also don't give all the
29:20 details of how they did something in
29:22 their paper you know like open ai is
29:24 like oh here's a daily 2 paper but then
29:27 it's so awake
29:28 you don't actually know what's going on
29:30 you're like
29:31 is this what they mean is that what they
29:32 mean you know so
29:34 yeah i i completely agree i think it
29:36 would make much more sense if there are
29:38 maybe an industry industry-specific
29:39 conference that you can go to that you
29:41 can understand how people do things it
29:44 builds relationships but also
29:46 um
29:47 it's probably much more useful to know
29:50 what kind of a variation of a very
29:52 common algorithm they are using in their
29:54 niche and if that niche also is where
29:57 you are working that would be extremely
29:59 useful to see hey you know these guys
30:01 came up with something let me also apply
30:02 that to my work so that would be much
30:05 more useful than to kind of doom scroll
30:07 on twitter and think about how you're
30:08 missing out
30:11 that doesn't sound very good right no
30:15 yeah i noticed that we have quite a few
30:17 questions so i thought we should
30:19 check them out so the first question we
30:21 have is
30:22 what is the most pressing issue for a
30:24 data scientist today
30:26 what is the most sorry pressing issue
30:28 the most pressing issue yes
30:31 um
30:32 in terms of
30:33 like how we work i guess
30:36 yeah i think so like maybe from
30:38 management or for peers or from the
30:41 society from the community yeah
30:43 i think the one i had at least i can
30:45 answer from my perspective and
30:48 remembering how the people i
30:51 uh interviewed answered me is how much
30:54 people don't understand what data
30:56 science does
30:58 so you know i always say if you want to
30:59 become a data scientist one of the key
31:01 skills that you have to have is
31:02 communication skills doesn't mean that
31:04 you have to be an extroverted person or
31:06 anything it's just that you need to be
31:08 able to explain your work in clear terms
31:10 to people that are not technical people
31:13 and
31:14 when you can't do that or the people are
31:17 refusing to listen to you then you have
31:19 this problem of uh what you're doing is
31:21 not valuable it is taking too much time
31:23 and you're telling me that it's still 90
31:25 accurate so it means it's not 100
31:27 accurate so how can i use this in my
31:28 work and
31:30 that makes a lot of
31:32 areas in the world like a lot of
31:34 industries uh kind of resistant to
31:37 starting to embrace data science uh some
31:40 of them rightfully so like medical field
31:42 right of course you want really complete
31:44 accuracy if you want to use a medical
31:46 application but some of them not so much
31:49 and there are still plenty of industries
31:51 who are not yet using data science
31:53 partially because
31:54 they don't understand it
31:56 and that was one of the main issues that
31:59 i faced
32:00 and it was a big struggle trying to
32:02 explain
32:03 yourself and the work that you do in a
32:05 way that people will understand because
32:06 you know we were just saying in the
32:08 beginning it's even hard to explain it
32:10 to your mom and you have all the time in
32:11 the world to explain it and still it's
32:13 kind of hard and when you deal with
32:15 these people who have been doing the
32:17 same thing in the same way for the last
32:19 30 years it's kind of hard to change
32:21 their minds
32:23 and i'm wondering if this in these
32:25 companies like medical field that fields
32:28 in companies where they don't yet
32:33 i have some unreasonable expectations
32:35 from data scientists maybe not in terms
32:37 of
32:38 how up to date they are but in terms of
32:41 the work they do like the
32:43 um
32:44 they just come they imagine a data
32:45 scientist coming in i don't know in the
32:48 shining armor and just you know
32:50 defending all the data issues and
32:53 effect model that works
32:55 yeah exactly i think it's a lot about
32:57 perspective too i like giving this
32:59 example of self-driving cars you know a
33:02 lot of people die in traffic currently
33:05 and
33:06 all cars are being driven by humans
33:08 right and there are a lot of traffic
33:09 accident a lot of people die
33:11 but probably once we start having wildly
33:13 adapted self-driving cars when the first
33:16 person dies of a self-driving car people
33:18 are going to lose it and they're going
33:20 to be like these self-driving cars are
33:22 killing people you know and then there
33:24 should be off the street stage they're
33:26 dangerous whereas probably uh i don't
33:29 know maybe one fifth of people amount of
33:31 people will die actually because there
33:33 will be less accidents but the problem
33:35 is there are going to be different kinds
33:36 of accidents than the type of accidents
33:38 that people make so you could think oh
33:41 this person was not going to die if this
33:42 car was being driven by a person but
33:44 then yeah but for every person that that
33:47 happened to maybe there are like 50
33:49 other people that no accident happened
33:51 to you so that is a
33:53 mindset shift that i think still needs
33:54 to happen
33:56 in the world to fully embrace and not be
33:58 scared of ai generally
34:02 and i guess in medical field this is
34:04 especially important so it's a sensitive
34:06 area self-driving cars because this is
34:08 about uh you know people's lives
34:11 right
34:12 yeah no you i i think it's completely
34:15 valid um the only thing i don't
34:18 understand is when people also resist
34:20 using ai assisted systems right i think
34:24 it makes a lot of sense to have
34:26 ai systems helping
34:28 doctors or
34:30 medical practitioners in general to make
34:32 decisions doesn't mean that it has to
34:34 make a decision autonomously but you
34:36 know maybe just like help me take the
34:38 easiest cases of your hands or um
34:41 you know just kind of help me assist you
34:44 in your decision making but i think even
34:46 that is kind of being met with a lot of
34:47 resistance so far
34:50 yeah i think the reason is that people
34:51 are afraid that ai will take over their
34:53 jobs right it will yeah that also
34:56 doesn't help
34:58 yeah generally i mean also you know when
35:00 you talk to your friend who does not
35:02 really know much about ai and you know
35:04 they they hear about this like new
35:06 technology and then everyone is like oh
35:08 isn't it scary like that's that's one of
35:10 the first things that i hear from people
35:11 isn't scary and i'm like no it's not
35:14 these things are stupid like you don't
35:16 get it you know it can only do this one
35:18 thing and one thing only and it's it's
35:21 like not about to uh take over the world
35:23 or anything but
35:25 it's kind of hard to uh know that of
35:27 course when you're not in the field
35:30 okay and there was some other topic i
35:32 wanted to talk about and
35:35 maybe as a
35:36 segway to this topic so this feeling of
35:39 being of having this fear of missing out
35:44 so i think it
35:45 feels like like it creates a feeling
35:48 that i'm constantly unqualified right so
35:51 i'm
35:53 i am afraid that
35:55 you know now the world moves on but i
35:57 don't understand this thing
35:59 so because i don't understand this thing
36:01 i will not be able to do my work well if
36:04 i don't do my work well then i'll be out
36:06 of my work and i will not be able to get
36:08 another job so i will have to i don't
36:11 know clean the data
36:13 for the rest of my life
36:15 right so where is this feeling coming
36:18 from
36:19 i think it's because we are constantly
36:21 working towards a moving target that
36:24 that's my main observation
36:26 i think
36:27 you know like we said there are always
36:29 new models coming out new technologies
36:31 coming out other people are doing
36:32 amazing work and then you see all about
36:34 it on social media or maybe even in your
36:37 company in your other data science team
36:38 that is in your company and
36:40 it is kind of hard to imagine
36:42 that you are enough when you see all
36:45 these other people uh but
36:47 yeah i think it's just because you have
36:49 a list in your head you think that okay
36:52 when i know all of these things i will
36:53 be a complete person a complete data
36:55 scientist but then you keep adding these
36:58 things to that list so at the end you
37:00 never actually reach that point where
37:02 you feel confident in your skills and i
37:04 think that's the main issue that data
37:06 scientists deal with because you know
37:08 the new things are coming out like
37:09 nearly every day at some point in that
37:11 startup that i was working at
37:13 i was trying to
37:16 not implement but use this model that
37:19 for which the paper was published 20
37:21 days before i started working on it and
37:24 i was like okay cutting edge but at the
37:26 same time a little bit stressful
37:27 honestly because no one knows how it
37:29 works there are not enough stack
37:31 overflow questions about this there are
37:32 not enough reddit posts about this so
37:35 yeah it's kind of like
37:37 you know it gets a bit too much i think
37:39 at some point
37:40 did it work
37:42 um
37:43 [Music]
37:45 i don't think it did
37:47 yeah i don't remember fully because it
37:49 was like we were using a lot of
37:50 different things but i think we just
37:53 didn't end up using it at the end but i
37:55 learned about it so that's something
37:57 okay
37:58 so the there is this uh concept of the
38:01 imposter syndrome like is it related to
38:03 that like this list that we have in our
38:05 heads and we keep adding to this like
38:07 because i guess like uh i am an imposter
38:11 till i cover everything in that list but
38:14 at the same time i me again
38:16 a
38:21 yeah yeah it's really like a terrifying
38:23 feeling when you think about it because
38:25 all you can focus on is like
38:27 i got to this point by luck
38:30 and i don't actually know enough and
38:32 someone is going to figure it out and
38:34 they're going to point at me and laugh
38:35 at me right
38:37 uh but generally that's
38:39 i mean i'm not sure if uh people who are
38:42 really establishing their fields would
38:44 feel that way
38:45 but definitely i think that's something
38:47 that many beginner data scientists feel
38:50 in their first couple of years
38:52 but i think that happens because
38:55 there is this error in many companies if
38:57 it's not specifically said not to be the
38:59 case that you should really know already
39:02 when you start to start your job about
39:04 everything but that's really really not
39:06 the case like most of the time when
39:08 companies hire a entry-level data
39:10 scientist or a beginner level data
39:13 science kind of a junior
39:15 your job is to learn new things your job
39:17 is not to already know things your job
39:20 is to
39:21 have this baseline where you know the
39:23 basics and you can pick up new concepts
39:26 really quickly so
39:28 people feel like an imposter but
39:30 actually they are exactly where they
39:32 should be at they don't have to know
39:33 anything and you know there's so many
39:35 different frameworks languages libraries
39:38 that you can use that there is no way
39:40 that you can know all these things and
39:42 your job when you just start a company
39:43 doesn't even have to be junior honestly
39:45 you can be a media or even senior that
39:48 you just have a way of learning things
39:51 quickly and that's your job and you
39:53 start to start some work and you just
39:55 need to ask questions um you know
39:58 question other people's decisions ask
40:00 them about how they did something and
40:02 learn about these things and
40:04 that's honestly for me that's what it
40:06 means to be a data scientist and not
40:08 knowing all of these things in advance
40:11 so let's say there is a new framework
40:13 and you think this framework is useful
40:16 so you decide to pick this up and
40:18 learn a little bit of this right so
40:21 because we don't want to learn it
40:23 perfectly we know that this is
40:26 not going to
40:27 be a great way of spending our time
40:30 so we want to learn a little bit so how
40:32 do we know when it's good enough like
40:35 that we know it well enough to
40:38 you know to stop learning
40:41 um that's a good question
40:43 i guess what i would say is
40:45 uh unless you have like
40:48 let's say you have like a job that you
40:49 want to apply to right that's what let's
40:51 say that's why you learned this thing
40:53 because you saw that there are
40:54 requirements uh listed this is one of
40:56 the frameworks that you should know
40:58 how i would go about this is basically
41:00 find other companies where they are
41:02 looking for this
41:04 and interview with them and see you know
41:07 what kind of questions they ask me and
41:09 if i
41:10 feel like i know enough to answer these
41:12 questions
41:13 um but
41:14 it is
41:15 always tricky because every company has
41:18 a bit of a different expectation
41:20 from people and different level of
41:22 competency when it comes to languages
41:24 and frameworks and technologies and
41:26 stuff
41:27 so
41:28 that would be a really hard question to
41:30 answer i think but
41:33 yeah as i said what i would do is to
41:35 learn the basics and bring myself to a
41:38 point where i feel like if they tell me
41:40 hey can you learn how to do this in this
41:42 framework that i could do it in like one
41:44 day
41:47 perhaps another thing useful thing is to
41:49 focus on a specific
41:51 use case specific application and once
41:53 you achieve this result
41:55 let's say i don't know you need to build
41:56 a web form quickly and you found this
41:58 streamlit
42:00 framework right
42:01 so you have a form in your head once you
42:03 have something similar and then it's
42:05 probably good enough right you can move
42:06 on but
42:09 if you cannot build a form you want in
42:10 your head maybe you need to ask yourself
42:13 is it even possible maybe i shouldn't
42:14 stop
42:15 i should stop trying right and look at
42:17 other ways so yeah
42:19 and again
42:21 like the question here is like when do
42:23 you stop like how do you know and stop
42:25 and what is helpful i think is somehow
42:27 time
42:28 have it to like time it give it a time
42:31 frame yeah so like i spent on this no
42:34 more than i don't know two three days
42:36 and then if it takes more than maybe
42:38 yeah it's not worth yeah maybe it's not
42:39 working yeah yeah spending a month i
42:42 think
42:43 that's a good idea
42:45 okay i i
42:47 see that we have quite a lot of
42:48 questions so because i also prepared
42:50 questions for you but i think it's
42:52 better if we go through the questions
42:53 yeah
42:55 yes
42:56 the first question is about the types of
42:58 data scientists this is something we
42:59 talked at the beginning
43:01 and the question is which type of data
43:03 scientist do you like being and which
43:05 type is the best
43:08 oh well i feel like there's one question
43:10 because the one i like being i feel like
43:12 would be the best for me
43:14 um
43:16 let me think i think from the ones i
43:19 experienced i like being an in-house
43:22 data scientist the best because
43:24 when you're a consultant data scientist
43:26 or
43:27 well let me go one by one when you're a
43:29 consultant data scientist
43:30 you are being sent out to a different
43:32 company and that company is basically
43:34 the client right and then you cannot
43:37 really judge their decisions too much so
43:39 you have to do what they want from you
43:43 same thing happens if you're a
43:44 freelancer for example
43:46 and they kind of have a client and you
43:48 have to go with their rules of course
43:50 you can guide them
43:52 and try to nudge them in the right
43:53 direction but at the end of the day if
43:54 they want something they want something
43:56 uh but when you're an in-house data
43:58 scientist you really have the power to
44:00 say like no guys this is wrong you
44:02 shouldn't do it that way and i really
44:04 like that because it kind of gives me a
44:06 feeling of completion i do not have to
44:09 be like okay i know that's not the right
44:11 way but let me do it that way you know
44:12 you can really say no i am the expert
44:14 here and you have to listen to me so
44:17 that's something i really enjoy so
44:19 that's
44:20 why i would say it's my favorite
44:22 um you can also of course be like a more
44:25 in a more research environment right you
44:27 can be a researcher in a company or an
44:29 academy that's also possible you can if
44:31 you call yourself a data scientist at
44:32 that point of course that's kind of a
44:33 choice some people call them like ai
44:35 researcher
44:37 but
44:38 that one i think is also really fun but
44:40 i just i don't like that version because
44:42 then
44:43 your life is a lot about the research
44:46 and not always about producing results
44:48 and i kind of like seeing quick results
44:50 so
44:51 that's why in-house data scientist is my
44:54 favorite
44:55 and i think is the best one
44:57 i haven't worked as a
44:59 consultant data scientist but from what
45:01 i heard from other people who like doing
45:04 this
45:04 they like exposure to different projects
45:07 like because
45:08 they are not
45:10 air quotes stuck with the same problem
45:12 for two years
45:14 but they get to
45:16 work on many many different problems and
45:18 then they have maybe a broader not so
45:21 deep skill set but quite broad right and
45:23 for some people this is what they like
45:25 to have because every client is a little
45:28 bit different they work on a little bit
45:30 different problems or maybe completely
45:31 different problems so they
45:33 get exposed to different things but
45:35 again you probably have to ask yourself
45:37 like
45:38 what do you like more seeing
45:40 the results of your work
45:42 or you know just preparing a powerpoint
45:44 presentation and handing it over and
45:46 then not knowing what happens after that
45:48 right
45:49 yeah that's definitely true you do get
45:51 exposed to different projects but
45:54 if someone out there wants to be a
45:56 consultant i think and if that's their
45:58 reason they want to work on different
46:00 projects i would really urge them to ask
46:02 the company how many kind of different
46:04 projects their data scientists worked on
46:06 this year because sometimes there are no
46:08 projects and then you don't have a
46:10 project and then it's boring
46:12 so
46:13 this obviously doesn't happen in every
46:15 company
46:16 and also like you know they might tell
46:17 you oh we have many different industries
46:19 but if the country you're working in
46:21 does not have that many different
46:22 industries then you are stuck with the
46:24 same industries at the end of the day
46:26 anyways uh so those things are quite
46:29 like nuanced i think uh it's really easy
46:32 to say like oh yeah i work in many
46:33 different companies in many different
46:34 industries but the reality might not be
46:37 that way so i think that's something to
46:38 look out for
46:40 yeah in case of ibm or maybe not let you
46:42 say uh let's not use ibm but let's say
46:45 there is a company in the netherlands
46:47 who works who works with benny lux
46:50 companies right belgium netherlands and
46:52 luxembourg right so i guess you're kind
46:55 of limited to whatever interest is there
46:58 in this geographical region because this
47:00 is where the company works right no of
47:02 course yeah so then then you are uh
47:04 definitely dependent on the region that
47:06 you're working in uh but
47:08 netherlands actually quite we were quite
47:09 lucky to have belgium and luxembourg
47:12 included the netherlands itself also has
47:14 like a lot of different industries uh
47:16 included in them uh so that was quite
47:20 lucky of me but i i've definitely heard
47:22 people for example like in turkey
47:26 i had some friends who were struggling
47:28 to find projects and that is not the
47:30 most fun place to be
47:32 okay and there is a related question
47:35 do you think it's better to be a
47:37 specialist as a data scientist or to be
47:39 a person with a broad skill set
47:42 uh my opinion on this is that i like to
47:44 be a generalist and i like to know a lot
47:46 about everything well a little bit about
47:48 everything
47:50 but mainly it's just kind of my
47:52 personality because i like learning new
47:54 things and
47:55 uh i guess i do not really have the
47:57 patience to
47:58 be a specialized person
48:00 but uh i i wouldn't say one of them is
48:02 better than the other one as i said it
48:04 really depends on the kind of work you
48:06 want to do if you're like i want to be
48:07 an nlp expert well there you have it you
48:10 have to really specialize in that area
48:12 but if you're like you know what i like
48:13 this data science thing and i want to
48:15 learn as much as i can in this area then
48:17 just you know go ahead and learn
48:18 different things but then you probably
48:20 have to accept that that is going to
48:22 limit the opportunities that you can
48:24 take like you will not become a
48:25 researcher
48:26 uh at like facebook or something so yeah
48:29 you know ups and downs
48:31 so it will
48:32 broaden your opportunities but at the
48:34 same time limit right because yeah
48:36 exactly so basically like if there is
48:39 like a
48:40 pyramid let's say maybe there is like
48:42 top two percent of job opportunities
48:43 where like the elite data scientists and
48:45 researchers are working that will
48:47 probably not be accessible to a
48:48 generalist
48:50 okay but at the same time you have like
48:52 this bottom
48:53 where like all the laptops in the world
48:56 they yeah exactly like one day you can
48:58 work for a medical startup the next day
49:00 you can go work for like amazon or
49:02 something so you can really jump around
49:04 and hop around because
49:06 then your skill would
49:07 be necessarily about like techniques
49:09 that you're using
49:11 and machine learning in general and you
49:12 can apply to different industries and
49:14 different types of work
49:16 so being a generalist team is not only
49:20 something for consultant data scientists
49:22 it's also for
49:23 data scientists working in startups
49:25 because i remember when i worked at
49:26 startup i needed to do pretty much
49:28 everything so sometimes i would just go
49:30 get some groceries for example and bring
49:32 them to the office
49:33 because in startup there is no office
49:35 management right so if you want to get
49:37 uh some food go and get this right there
49:39 is no special place yeah that's how i
49:41 learned streamled for example i mean i
49:43 didn't get groceries but you know then i
49:45 for example we were building projects
49:47 and we wanted to showcase the projects
49:48 we didn't have an engineer in the team
49:50 so they were like oh how can we do it
49:52 and then you know our manager was like
49:53 well i heard about this thing
49:54 streamlined and i'm like okay i'm on it
49:56 you know and then you build like a web
49:57 app or i did have to do quite a bit of
50:00 devops when i was in that com company
50:02 too because
50:03 i kind of like it actually because you
50:06 kind of just end up learning out of need
50:08 so you're not like oh i have to improve
50:11 my skill set and then you sit down and
50:13 study something but it's more like okay
50:14 guys we need to do this who wants to
50:15 take it on and then you take it on and
50:17 you learn how to do it
50:19 that's also it also answers the question
50:22 is when you know when it's good enough
50:23 right when it works then it doesn't
50:25 break down every on every second request
50:28 then it's good enough right yeah exactly
50:32 okay
50:33 for newer data scientists
50:36 uh from courses like yours or bootcamps
50:38 how would you suggest they break into
50:40 the oversaturated market for entry-level
50:42 data scientists
50:44 um so i think it comes down to kind of
50:47 like job
50:49 hunting skills
50:51 the advice i give to everyone basically
50:53 is to apply as much as they can but in a
50:57 smart way
50:58 because i think people get really
50:59 overwhelmed with all the
51:01 uh
51:02 requirements
51:04 that people hr managers list and most of
51:06 the time they don't really know what
51:07 they're talking about and you know if
51:09 you look at a list of skills that you
51:11 need and you know don't know like 20 30
51:14 of it i would say just apply either way
51:16 and if they're a nice company they'll
51:18 probably get back to you and they'll
51:19 give you a reason why they're rejecting
51:21 you um
51:22 so
51:23 and also another thing is if you have a
51:26 goal of being in a company or generally
51:28 in an industry i would try to network uh
51:31 i do not like that work the word
51:33 networking
51:34 but you know you have this thing in
51:36 front of you like linkedin and you can
51:39 really use it uh to advance your career
51:41 and you'll be surprised how many people
51:43 actually get back to you like just find
51:45 the
51:46 uh you want to be a data scientist in a
51:47 company okay go find a data scientist in
51:50 a company or somewhere in a related
51:53 field uh or in a related role and just
51:56 kind of like send them a message send
51:57 them a nice message
51:58 being like hey i am interested in
52:00 working your comp in your company i want
52:02 to learn more about it and many times
52:04 people are just like happy to talk to
52:06 you about their experiences they're of
52:08 course nicer and not
52:10 less nice ways of doing this like i get
52:12 messages sometimes they're a bit more
52:14 like entitled like hey be my mentor or
52:17 something like that i'm like excuse me
52:19 have you met you know uh so i think
52:23 definitely like
52:24 writing a short message asking the
52:26 people that you want to talk to like hey
52:28 like do you have like 15 minutes or half
52:30 an hour to spare to answer some
52:32 questions i'm really interested in your
52:34 company and here are my reasons uh i
52:36 think that
52:37 you would get a good amount of response
52:39 and i think that is like a great way to
52:41 have an in with people that are in the
52:43 company that you want to work for yeah
52:46 be my mentor is something i also receive
52:48 quite often and this is yeah first of
52:50 all it's so demanding in terms of time
52:52 right so being a mentor is time
52:55 investment right so i need to know you
52:57 to actually invest time it's an intimate
52:59 relationship it's not something that you
53:02 just demand out of someone
53:04 yeah
53:05 and then like it's also not super
53:07 specific like what kind of help you need
53:09 like or what kind of questions and this
53:11 is like i guess a good way to start this
53:14 conversation is like this is my problem
53:16 i don't know how to solve it
53:18 do you know a good way of you know like
53:21 you don't
53:22 maybe you don't need a mentor you just
53:23 need to find an answer to this question
53:26 and then move on until you have another
53:28 question right and then if you have a
53:30 mentor who is uh
53:32 all this
53:34 always there for you answering these
53:36 questions cool but if you don't have a
53:37 mentor you don't maybe you don't need
53:40 one right so there the internet
53:42 yeah yeah i think people try to
53:45 get help unless it's like yeah yeah
53:47 people try to get help sometimes before
53:49 they really understand what they need as
53:51 exactly like you're saying and
53:53 when you get a vague
53:55 approach like that it is very likely
53:57 that i will not even reply uh but i
54:00 would suggest everyone who wants to get
54:02 into a company or just generally a data
54:03 science career is to
54:06 really think about what you want what do
54:08 you need right now and then ask really
54:10 direct and clear questions if i see a
54:13 question that i can answer with a quick
54:15 voice message or a couple of sentences
54:17 of text i definitely do it because if
54:20 it's like really nicely specified of
54:21 like what kind of thing they need help
54:22 with um but yeah the way you go the less
54:26 likely that people are going to respond
54:27 to you
54:30 okay
54:31 the next question is about your current
54:34 employer assembly i ai so how would you
54:36 suggest a junior level data scientist or
54:38 ml engineer catch the eye of assembly ai
54:44 ah interesting question
54:46 so it is very hard for me to reply to
54:49 this because i am not in the engineering
54:51 team and i do not know exactly what
54:53 they're looking for i'm in the marketing
54:54 team right now
54:55 uh
54:56 so
54:57 to not speculate and say something wrong
55:00 i would probably
55:02 don't answer this question because you
55:04 know i don't want to misguide people i
55:06 really haven't even looked at the open
55:08 positions and what they are requiring
55:10 so yeah i don't want to speculate
55:12 but let's say you will replace assembly
55:14 ai with the company x
55:17 so how would you answer that question if
55:19 it's a company
55:21 that you don't know but maybe you have
55:22 some ideas how would somebody
55:25 get attention from a company they want
55:27 to get in
55:29 well my go-to advice and that's exactly
55:31 what i do too is to first understand
55:33 what this company is doing in their
55:35 industry and their technology and you
55:37 don't have to be an expert but kind of
55:39 understand uh
55:41 what are they doing what kind of field
55:43 are they in what are the main challenges
55:45 in this field and this information is
55:46 not hard to find like you can literally
55:48 google it um
55:50 that's the first thing and kind of have
55:52 some questions lined up for them that
55:54 will be interesting for them to answer
55:56 um
55:57 and you know it should kind of be
55:58 interesting to you too because you don't
55:59 want to work somewhere where you're
56:00 going to be bored
56:02 and
56:03 generally i would really advise people
56:05 to have a couple of projects out there
56:08 that they can present
56:10 ideally relevant to the job that they're
56:12 applying to but doesn't have to be
56:14 just kind of showcase the skills that
56:16 you recently learned one really good way
56:18 of doing this is to kind of build
56:20 streamlined projects on top of your
56:21 machine learning projects that you do it
56:23 doesn't have to be professional projects
56:25 you know it could be personal projects
56:26 that you do
56:27 um
56:28 and yeah just kind of like have a way of
56:31 proving to these people that you have
56:32 been working on your skills and you and
56:35 know about their industry and you're
56:36 curious about their industry so just do
56:40 some research have some questions
56:41 prepared and make sure that you have a
56:44 way of
56:46 showing what you know
56:48 research i know it's kind of like it's
56:50 it's not like really snappy uh advice
56:53 but unfortunately that's that's the
56:54 reality like you know it's not like wake
56:57 up at 5 a.m every morning and then write
56:59 down what you want from your day so it's
57:01 not like that unfortunately like you
57:03 have to put in a consistent work into
57:05 these things to catch people's eyes
57:09 yeah and the a question that is quite
57:10 related so you mentioned projects or
57:12 projects that could be relevant
57:14 potentially to
57:15 the employer you are interested in so of
57:18 course you need to do research some
57:19 research to find out what is
57:22 what could be more interested
57:24 interesting for this employer and then
57:26 also prepare questions that you would
57:27 ask
57:31 she now asks about these projects
57:33 because the question is i see that every
57:36 new data scientist endlessly repeat the
57:38 same project i think the person means
57:40 like titanic or catso versus dogs or i
57:43 don't know
57:44 your favorite uh
57:46 i don't know famous data sets here iris
57:48 for example i don't know
57:50 so how would you go about creating a
57:52 good project for potential employers as
57:54 a newbie so i think you partly answered
57:56 that like do research in the company
57:59 where you want to work and then find a
58:02 project
58:03 i guess it's not always possible right
58:04 so what if this
58:05 company works uh like this is a car
58:08 manufacturing company like you cannot
58:10 have a project about manufacturing a car
58:13 yeah i think uh
58:15 yeah that's so that's a good point
58:16 obviously people are doing the same
58:18 projects
58:19 but i think
58:20 with these projects what they're what
58:22 you're trying to show is not how great
58:24 of a model that you're building the
58:26 model you build might suck and that's
58:28 fine i think like if i was a hiring
58:29 manager that's how i would think um
58:32 because what you're trying to show is
58:34 that you understand
58:36 how data behaves you understand what
58:38 kind of problems that can be in the data
58:42 you know how to deal with these problems
58:44 and you know how to build a model and
58:48 you know what to do
58:49 when something goes wrong in this model
58:51 so you know if it's overfitting you are
58:53 able to understand oh hey it is
58:55 overfitting and then you can come up
58:56 with some options you don't even have to
58:58 apply to apply them honestly if you have
59:00 a notebook where you do some analysis on
59:02 the titanic uh data set and then you're
59:05 like oh here i tried this but then it
59:07 overfit here are some things i think i
59:08 can do to fix them and yeah if you have
59:10 time you know you can go further because
59:12 as you know like sometimes data data
59:14 science projects are like endless there
59:15 are so many things you can try and so
59:17 many things you can do kind of like a
59:18 future work you know it can be like if i
59:20 had more time i would do this and that
59:22 so that's why i don't think the
59:24 project itself really matters
59:26 especially for beginner data scientists
59:29 it's just showing
59:31 that you can do critical thinking and
59:33 you know the tools that are available
59:35 and you know when to use them
59:37 i would still not like use titanic or
59:39 whatever because i think they're kind of
59:41 boring but
59:44 i would try to find data sets that are
59:47 from real life so actually collected in
59:49 real life one that i really like to use
59:52 that i also use in my course is uh new
59:55 york city open data it's from new york
59:56 city open data and it is like
59:59 the
1:00:00 taxi rides the the informational data on
1:00:03 that is collected on taxi rides and it
1:00:06 is extremely dirty there are so many
1:00:08 things that is wrong with that data but
1:00:09 i mean
1:00:10 you know it's like real life obviously
1:00:12 so that happens
1:00:13 so i would really suggest that you find
1:00:15 a source like that by the way new york
1:00:17 city open data has a lot of different
1:00:19 types of data so like definitely go
1:00:20 check it out
1:00:22 you have reddit for example in reddit
1:00:24 datasets subreddit i think has a lot of
1:00:26 different types of data sets that people
1:00:28 are posting just kind of find try to
1:00:30 find one that at least resembles real
1:00:33 life data a little bit of course real
1:00:35 life data is not really made publicly
1:00:37 available most of the time uh and as far
1:00:39 as i know the ones on kaggle are like
1:00:41 quite well prepared and clean and
1:00:43 everything so
1:00:45 yeah i think if you just get a piece of
1:00:48 data that at least resembles real life
1:00:50 and then you do your best on top of it
1:00:53 that that is you know enough of a
1:00:55 project you don't really have to build
1:00:56 anything mind-blowing or interesting if
1:00:58 you cannot come up with an idea
1:01:00 yeah and speaking of these separated
1:01:02 data sets i remember i needed to find a
1:01:04 data set but google googling wasn't
1:01:08 helpful
1:01:09 um yeah that happens and i asked on this
1:01:11 subreddit and actually there were people
1:01:13 who suggested ways to find this data
1:01:16 and yeah there is also a website on
1:01:19 stack exchange network i don't remember
1:01:21 but this is like stacker of robot for
1:01:22 data sets there is a
1:01:24 i think it's like open date or free data
1:01:26 something like that
1:01:28 yeah you can also check it out and you
1:01:29 can just ask a question about like i'm
1:01:32 looking for a data set
1:01:34 um
1:01:35 yeah i need help
1:01:36 by the way do you have time for one more
1:01:38 question or you need to call it sure
1:01:41 so let's take one more question so the
1:01:44 question is the what's your stance on
1:01:46 companies
1:01:47 thinking only about hiring phds or
1:01:50 people with master's degrees and they
1:01:52 think only they can be data scientists
1:01:54 what would you say to them
1:01:56 uh
1:01:57 i would say that they don't know what
1:01:59 they're doing
1:02:01 so
1:02:01 yeah it really depends so of course
1:02:03 that's kind of like a controversial
1:02:05 statement um
1:02:08 companies don't always know what they
1:02:09 need so
1:02:11 that's i think one of the things that
1:02:12 i've learned being in the industry for a
1:02:14 couple of years
1:02:16 they just think hey we need someone who
1:02:18 understands uh how these things work and
1:02:22 you know it seems like they should
1:02:23 probably have a master's degree right
1:02:25 and they're like look around yeah
1:02:26 probably right yeah yeah probably they
1:02:28 don't really know what people learn in
1:02:30 master's degrees honestly i felt like i
1:02:32 did not learn much in my master's degree
1:02:34 maybe i did but you know i kind of felt
1:02:36 more or less the same
1:02:37 like i graduated from bachelor's so
1:02:41 it is i think especially with phds like
1:02:45 if you want to become a researcher if
1:02:46 you really need to understand
1:02:48 the algorithms that you're working with
1:02:49 obviously yeah you probably do need a
1:02:51 phd but other than that if you're going
1:02:53 to be a consultant data scientist or
1:02:55 something similar you probably don't
1:02:57 need it like as i said
1:03:00 you go to a company to learn because
1:03:02 data science is a really practical field
1:03:04 right most of the time we don't need to
1:03:06 build the tools that we're using like
1:03:08 you have scikit-learn when is ever
1:03:10 anyone ever going to build a decision
1:03:12 tree by themselves like that that
1:03:13 doesn't really happen so um
1:03:16 yeah it's um
1:03:19 of course companies get to decide this
1:03:21 themselves we can say whatever we want
1:03:22 about this not gonna change anything
1:03:25 but
1:03:26 yeah i think
1:03:28 it's probably not fair that that's how i
1:03:30 think about it it's just not a fair
1:03:31 comparison because as i said it's really
1:03:33 practical and if someone has done enough
1:03:36 projects and is able to show what
1:03:37 they've learned uh
1:03:39 just because i don't have a phd or a
1:03:41 master's degree should not be a reason
1:03:42 to not hire them
1:03:45 i guess there are companies like google
1:03:46 brain or open eye
1:03:48 that do research and the only way to
1:03:50 show that you can do research is to
1:03:52 actually research that's why they hire
1:03:53 phds because this is
1:03:55 a proof that you can do research and you
1:03:57 do not get bored because you've spent
1:03:59 significant amount of time defending
1:04:02 your phd dissertation but for the other
1:04:04 cases yeah maybe not so much right
1:04:07 no yeah i mean again yeah you know if a
1:04:09 company wants to do experimental things
1:04:11 they probably want someone with a phd or
1:04:13 at least like maybe someone with a phd
1:04:15 to lead the team so that's
1:04:16 understandable but
1:04:18 i don't think it's like it should be a
1:04:19 hard rule
1:04:21 okay thank you
1:04:26 i'm sorry i lost you there for a second
1:04:29 yeah okay the the question is how can
1:04:31 people find you
1:04:32 oh people can find me on my youtube
1:04:35 channel
1:04:36 uh masratwarp it's like the hardest name
1:04:39 probably uh
1:04:41 but
1:04:42 you see it somewhere on the uh you'll
1:04:44 send those titles we'll just include
1:04:46 this to the description and you can find
1:04:49 the channel
1:04:50 exactly so you can find my youtube

1:04:57 that's my twitter handle nothing in
1:04:58 between and yeah then we can keep in
1:05:00 touch you can ask questions to me there
