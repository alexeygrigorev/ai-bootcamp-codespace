1:12 so
1:14 greg works as a technology manager at
1:16 amazon where he builds ai products from
1:19 ground up

1:22 on linkedin where he shares a lot of
1:24 useful resources so welcome to our van
1:26 gag
1:28 thank you so much alex say thank you for
1:29 having me and uh
1:31 to talk to you and uh
1:34 lend the ears of the audience today as
1:36 well so hopefully uh you're doing great
1:38 on your side and that the year started
1:41 off to a good start
1:43 yeah thanks for joining us so before we
1:45 go into our main topic of product
1:48 management let's start with your
1:49 background can you tell us about your
1:51 career journey so far absolutely um so i
1:55 started in manufacturing i'm an
1:57 industrial engineer i also have a
1:59 master's in engineering management with
2:01 a focus around supply chain and business
2:05 so in manufacturing at it i had the
2:07 opportunity to
2:09 rotate around different positions
2:10 whether it's supply chain ops management
2:13 quality safety management uh then in
2:16 manufacturing also i had a chance to be
2:18 a product manager uh responsible for
2:21 value chain uh optimization and
2:24 especially pricing optimization uh which
2:27 was very fun and that was before i
2:28 joined amazon
2:30 uh in in
2:32 you know building some systems that are
2:34 either ai based or non-ai based uh to
2:37 make sure that i keep customers safe
2:39 when they go online and purchase uh the
2:42 products so
2:45 so you were managing actual products uh
2:48 i mean physical products before that
2:50 right
2:51 yeah yeah before that it was uh physical
2:53 products um understanding the value
2:56 chain from the time you
2:58 uh
2:59 you know put your strategy for
3:00 purchasing raw materials to put a
3:03 strategy behind where you want to
3:04 manufacture these products how much it
3:06 costs you to
3:08 produce them which are the distribution
3:10 centers
3:11 um the price of the products um and then
3:14 the marketing strategy and all that
3:16 stuff and all of these
3:18 uh
3:19 strategies in in
3:22 data that you're pulling is the role is
3:24 to
3:26 optimize the margin for all of these
3:29 products given that you're creating
3:31 value for
3:32 the customers that you serve and it was
3:34 a b2b
3:35 company uh in the chemical industry so
3:38 that was quite interesting to be able to
3:41 collaborate with different groups from a
3:43 commercial uh
3:45 team of sales folks
3:48 and also
3:49 finance and also you have
3:52 marketing
3:53 transportation
3:55 teams
3:56 and
3:57 it's uh it was good to be uh kind of in
4:00 the middle to coordinate all of this to
4:02 make sure that the uh
4:05 execution
4:07 of each department was
4:09 done on time to deliver uh exactly what
4:12 the customer is expected to
4:15 receive or be on so
4:19 so product manager is not a t-specific
4:22 role right so it's uh
4:24 no
4:25 i would say yeah i would say it varies
4:28 uh by
4:30 department even uh it's not only varies
4:33 by
4:34 a company it's like inside of a company
4:37 they could be different roles a product
4:39 manager can take um
4:41 my latest at the manufacturing setting
4:43 as a product manager was developing
4:46 what i call data products
4:48 uh what i call data products is kind of
4:50 like a hub aggregator
4:52 of data that provides certain services
4:55 to to
4:57 uh its clients
4:58 my clients were
5:00 internally um when you think about
5:03 a group of sales folks who
5:06 often struggle to understand uh where to
5:10 get data how to get data and perform
5:12 some quick analysis to make quick
5:15 decisions or make informed decisions
5:18 so i would build uh key dashboards
5:22 that were run on top of
5:24 uh
5:25 you know curated pipelines
5:28 and that helped them
5:29 you know
5:30 build different things such as uh put
5:32 together
5:34 a
5:35 uh contract uh in less than five days
5:38 where they're able to explore
5:41 the distribution routings the
5:43 transportation capacity
5:46 assess the client's uh demand
5:50 over a period of time uh forecast this
5:53 demand uh assess the pricing assess the
5:56 pricing of their competitors
5:59 uh
6:00 work with you know marketing data to
6:02 understand what kind of uh discount this
6:05 customer needs to have
6:07 or even
6:08 uh understanding what the historical
6:11 data of that customer was
6:14 to understand what kind of uh new value
6:17 proposition they could put at the table
6:19 for that customer and the goal was to
6:22 kind of uh
6:23 generate these kind of contracts very
6:25 fast so you don't lose an opportunity to
6:28 book a long-term contract with these
6:29 customers so for that they needed access
6:32 to
6:33 curated data uh to minimize the time it
6:36 takes to to transform that data to
6:38 generate insights
6:41 yeah that's quite a lot of things
6:42 so you mentioned marketing you mentioned
6:44 pricing you mentioned transportation and
6:46 then building this internal data product
6:49 uh is this uh what a typical product
6:51 manager does so let's say let's take a
6:54 data team like a usual i.t company not
6:57 in one manufacturing company now let's
6:59 say a company has a website could be
7:01 e-commerce website
7:04 and so what the role of a product
7:06 manager could be
7:08 in such a company in a data team so what
7:10 are they usually responsible for
7:13 it's good to make the distinction about
7:16 between
7:17 you know data product management and
7:20 uh traditional product manager
7:23 management
7:24 um traditional product management there
7:26 are a lot of
7:28 data products that are being sold
7:31 uh to external customers that are being
7:34 managed and developed
7:36 um implemented
7:39 via the traditional product management
7:42 principles in best practices
7:46 um what i talk about specifically is
7:49 data product management for
7:51 you know products that are
7:54 being served internally so in this case
7:57 your customers are
7:58 sales folks marketing
8:00 uh finance
8:02 uh supply chain any program teams
8:06 that can leverage these services these
8:08 products to
8:09 um
8:10 consume and make decisions
8:13 uh
8:14 that generate value for the company
8:17 so when we think about the traditional
8:20 uh
8:21 product management best practice versus
8:23 data product management best practice
8:25 they have a common
8:28 principle that they will share
8:30 which is
8:31 always start with your customers
8:34 needs always start with
8:36 identifying
8:37 the customer's pain points and then
8:41 derive a vision for
8:43 uh and strategy for addressing that pain
8:46 point
8:47 so this is where they both come together
8:50 under that same principle
8:52 from which they can work backwards to
8:54 figure out how to
8:56 you know devise a solution uh for these
8:59 problems these pain points and also how
9:02 they can build a roadmap uh based on you
9:06 know
9:07 upon strategy
9:08 uh that they can deliver uh for the
9:11 customer uh to generate value and most
9:13 of the time generating value means
9:16 uh the service
9:17 or the agreement
9:19 that this product has made uh
9:23 is served
9:25 with regards to expected service level
9:28 agreement with regards to
9:30 um
9:32 you know whatever whatever the problem
9:34 uh
9:35 these customers are facing
9:37 the mission of that product is to solve
9:39 that problem
9:40 uh if you think about a sandwich
9:43 the mission of that sandwich is to
9:45 uh
9:46 fill up the belly uh to satisfy
9:49 somebody's hunger for example
9:51 uh so
9:52 um after that customer consumes that
9:54 sandwich
9:56 the
9:56 vision is that uh the mission is that uh
9:59 hunger goes away right so just a simple
10:02 example of of the term uh any if you
10:06 look at the
10:07 sample definition
10:10 of product by itself it simply means uh
10:14 an artifact or a substance
10:16 that is manufactured
10:18 into
10:20 uh a a service
10:22 um manufactured into
10:25 uh
10:26 a final output
10:28 uh that generates uh value for a
10:31 consumer
10:32 so
10:33 yeah so basically the work uh the the
10:35 role of product manager to identify the
10:38 needs of a customer
10:40 then think how they can be
10:43 addressed
10:45 and then
10:46 derive a vision strategy
10:48 and then you set work backwards and then
10:52 eventually build the service that solves
10:54 this particular pain point this need
10:56 right and this whole thing this service
10:59 is what a product is right and so
11:02 something that solves a particular
11:03 problem for
11:04 a particular group of people right
11:06 that's correct
11:08 okay and
11:09 then you mentioned that so this is
11:11 common for both traditional product
11:13 managers and data product managers so
11:15 both have
11:16 clients both solve problems
11:19 except that in one case traditional
11:20 product managers solve problems of
11:22 external
11:24 clients so to say
11:26 while data product managers usually
11:28 address the needs of internal clients
11:30 right
11:32 correct so again there could be data
11:34 product management
11:36 um for example a recommendation system
11:40 is something that i would call
11:42 a
11:43 data product
11:45 um a recommendation system is often used
11:48 by external customers therefore a
11:51 traditional product manager is capable
11:54 of managing a recommendation system
11:56 given that this product manager you know
11:58 gathers
11:59 uh specific skills to manage
12:02 uh these recommendation systems and
12:04 let's explore some of the skills in
12:06 general you're thinking about you're
12:08 talking about designing skills strategy
12:11 uh analytical skills
12:13 uh technical skills so
12:15 something about being able to manage a
12:18 data product
12:20 uh for external customers is to be able
12:22 to
12:23 have conversations with
12:25 engineers from a technical
12:28 design technical implementation or
12:32 architecture perspective
12:34 so
12:35 again a recommendation system can be
12:37 managed through traditional data uh
12:39 traditional product management and one
12:41 of the advantage or
12:43 not i wouldn't call it advantage but
12:45 more of a
12:47 leg up that traditional product
12:49 management has
12:50 is that you know there is
12:54 this
12:55 uh
12:56 ux design
12:58 uh aspect of it where for example these
13:01 products
13:02 can be served uh on a website they have
13:06 a good uh
13:08 design uh on the website versus
13:11 internally when you think about pure
13:13 data products uh it's
13:16 the ux design is probably lacking
13:19 meaning
13:20 you're collecting all of the data uh
13:23 aggregating them under one roof and then
13:26 serving them to
13:28 uh downstream clients
13:30 uh who can consume that so think about
13:33 how you would design a user interface
13:36 for something like this so
13:38 uh it's
13:39 there is uh there are limitations
13:42 so you need
13:44 um
13:45 there's an opportunity for internal data
13:47 product management to invite ux
13:49 designers to understand how to
13:52 uh
13:53 design that user interface uh for them
13:56 so
13:57 um
13:58 you know i'm hoping i'm making the
13:59 distinction between between between the
14:02 two
14:03 yeah and with all these responsibilities
14:06 regardless whether it's internal
14:07 external it's quite a lot of things
14:10 for a product manager
14:12 and
14:13 why in your opinion it's useful for data
14:16 professionals who are not product
14:18 managers let's say for data analysts
14:20 data engineers data scientists
14:22 why
14:23 it could be a good idea to also learn a
14:25 bit of product management
14:30 think uh it it helps because it
14:34 prepares your mental model
14:36 for
14:38 always starting at the end with the end
14:41 in mind
14:42 uh the end in mind means that you're
14:47 envisioning
14:49 a north star
14:51 service or products that
14:54 address
14:55 uh addresses key pain points for
14:58 your your customers
15:00 so with that mental model you're
15:03 capable of figuring out you know
15:07 who
15:08 are the stakeholders that allows you to
15:12 fulfill
15:14 this mission
15:15 um and with that there are also capable
15:18 of understanding
15:20 the customer journey which is a key
15:23 uh
15:25 part of
15:26 designing a solution for
15:28 your customers
15:30 and what that gives you as a data
15:32 analyst or a data scientist or you name
15:35 it any data professional
15:37 is
15:38 the ability to acquire domain knowledge
15:41 so if you're able to
15:44 express
15:46 understand the customer journey
15:50 um
15:51 for example for a data product
15:54 served on the
15:55 on the web
15:58 being able to
16:00 design express
16:02 detail that customer journey from the
16:04 time they enter the website navigate
16:08 through
16:09 click uh the different products until
16:11 conversion meaning until they accept to
16:14 purchase the product or service
16:17 and consume it and feel satisfied being
16:19 able to map that out
16:21 is something that will make you
16:24 a more powerful data analyst a more
16:26 powerful data scientist or a more
16:29 powerful data professional so being able
16:31 to acquire these skills can only help to
16:35 bridge the gap between
16:37 technical and non-technical
16:39 uh teams
16:41 what is the customer journey i think i
16:43 understood from your description is this
16:45 is a journey that a customer makes so
16:47 let's say they want to
16:49 purchase
16:50 a pair of headphones so they go to a
16:53 e-commerce website so first they need to
16:55 find what they are what they need right
16:58 wireless with wires and so on like
17:02 big ones small ones
17:04 so then so first they look for what they
17:06 need then maybe look at reviews and then
17:09 finally they make a decision uh click
17:11 the buy button and enter in the credit
17:13 card details and then a few days later
17:16 they unpack they think and
17:18 start listening for music right so
17:20 that's the the journey right
17:22 that's the that's the customer journey
17:24 exactly
17:25 so if you're if you're the product
17:27 manager for this website
17:29 uh that serve all these products like
17:32 you know headphones and things like that
17:34 you need to understand whether you're a
17:36 product manager or data
17:38 professional you need to understand that
17:39 customer journey so you can design
17:43 key solutions once you identify those
17:47 pain points
17:48 or the roadblocks that would prevent a
17:50 customer from
17:52 purchasing your product
17:54 and how how can i understand customer
17:56 journey better let's say as a data
17:58 scientist what do i do for that
18:01 obviously you will not be able to
18:04 uh
18:06 be on the grassroots of things where
18:08 you're
18:09 deep diving all the time so that's why
18:11 you need different teams right so
18:13 the best practice is to probably
18:15 interview
18:17 uh
18:18 most of the time data scientists don't
18:19 have access to the external customers
18:22 or the final consumers so it's best to
18:25 interview
18:26 your business uh partners
18:29 um
18:30 or researchers
18:32 exactly
18:33 your business partners are the product
18:34 managers
18:35 uh they're the department heads
18:38 etc etc business analysts
18:40 to help them understand
18:42 the current
18:43 uh standard operation procedures or
18:47 operational steps
18:48 when
18:50 transactions are made
18:53 for that product so
18:55 that's probably the best way read
18:57 documentations about
18:59 you know these processes
19:01 and uh at this point they were able to
19:04 gain knowledge but one of the
19:07 most powerful tool
19:09 that people often forget
19:11 um
19:12 to use which is available to us all
19:16 is the will to ask questions
19:18 uh forget asking the right questions at
19:20 first because
19:22 asking the right questions comes with
19:24 experience
19:25 so when you're new
19:27 into
19:28 the field of data science or anything
19:29 like that i always
19:31 find it
19:32 that those who become very powerful very
19:35 effective very efficient or the ones who
19:37 are willing to ask a lot of questions so
19:39 they can learn
19:40 and adjust and discover
19:43 so
19:44 um
19:46 the power this is a soft skill that's
19:48 definitely needed when it comes to
19:50 discovering uh domain knowledge so good
19:53 data scientists or good data
19:54 professionals
19:55 are good detectives
19:58 so
19:59 um
20:00 that's
20:01 probably the best way i can think about
20:03 that
20:03 yeah so
20:05 you need to be a good detective and then
20:07 find business partners business analysts
20:10 product managers domain experts and ask
20:13 them questions
20:14 it doesn't have to be
20:16 you know great questions
20:18 you just need to ask with you know
20:20 something
20:21 to understand the topic better and then
20:23 with time you will learn how to ask the
20:25 right questions right absolutely
20:28 and
20:29 so you mentioned you need to interview
20:31 and how how would you go about
20:33 interviewing them well these business
20:35 partners how would you structure
20:38 this
20:39 let's say
20:40 you want to set up a meeting just to
20:41 learn more about
20:44 customer journey more about operations
20:46 or i don't know something so you just
20:48 find first a domain expert and then you
20:51 want to schedule a meeting with them
20:53 right so how do you structure this
20:54 meeting how do you structure this
20:55 interview what do you ask them
20:57 i think
20:58 what i would advise in that case is
21:01 again start with the end in mind
21:04 um
21:05 it's not
21:06 good to just schedule a meeting without
21:09 a structure and that's why i like this
21:11 question
21:12 it's because you know you want to set a
21:14 meeting with purpose so what is the
21:16 purpose
21:17 of setting up the meeting
21:20 are you
21:22 setting up a meeting to simply learn
21:24 the general
21:26 operations
21:28 of the business
21:31 or are you
21:32 trying to surface the pain points
21:36 of the business are you trying to learn
21:38 what the key goals are
21:40 and then setting up a framework for
21:43 identifying
21:45 what the obstacles are that could
21:47 prevent
21:49 uh from reaching these key business
21:51 goals
21:52 or are you trying to surface
21:53 opportunities
21:55 that will
21:56 uh create an uptick or an increase
22:00 in those uh
22:02 metrics that help you reach those
22:04 business goals so with that again start
22:07 with the purpose of the meeting
22:10 um
22:11 and most of the time
22:12 it's to understand
22:15 what the business is trying to do which
22:17 is
22:18 understand what the business goals are
22:22 and then uh create a list of questions
22:25 to identify
22:26 the different obstacles that they're
22:29 uh
22:30 experiencing
22:32 that are posing a threat
22:35 to reaching these goals or even
22:37 identifying the current limitations they
22:40 have
22:41 uh that could
22:43 represent a threat to reach these goals
22:45 and then these data scientists can go
22:48 back and figure out
22:49 how to
22:51 generate or deploy new features that
22:54 allows them
22:55 that allow them to
22:58 reduce or this limitations add more
23:01 capabilities
23:02 or remove obstacles so these goals can
23:05 be met
23:07 and how do you identify
23:09 these obstacles what kind of questions
23:10 do you ask is it like okay explain tell
23:13 me about your day and what are you
23:16 struggling with or what kind of
23:17 questions are those
23:19 yeah and that could be
23:21 done through
23:23 a
23:24 some specific
23:25 uh use case right one of the most famous
23:28 ones
23:30 could be
23:32 oh well last year we made
23:35 you know a million dollars for easy
23:37 numbers
23:38 and
23:39 uh this year
23:42 around
23:43 well last year around the same time
23:46 we were already at a million
23:48 dollars and
23:51 this year
23:52 we're down
23:54 uh
23:55 30 percent
23:56 versus compared to last year and uh
23:59 we're not making money and we're trying
24:00 to figure out what's going on
24:03 so uh there are a lot of frameworks in
24:06 me being from manufacturing
24:08 i typically go with five why's when i
24:11 interview people or what do you think
24:12 that's happening
24:14 well
24:14 customers are leaving us they're not
24:17 going onto the website anymore to
24:18 purchase
24:20 and then asking those five why's allows
24:22 you to gather
24:23 preliminary
24:25 uh answers from the business which most
24:28 of the time i think data professionals
24:30 can take with a grain of salt because
24:32 why
24:34 uh business folks tend to
24:37 append or use leverage
24:41 their intuition
24:42 uh
24:44 their experience about the market to
24:47 kind of deduct
24:49 certain things that is if they didn't
24:51 have time to deep dive into data this is
24:53 where data scientists or data
24:55 professionals can go back into the data
24:58 to kind of
24:59 uh reconcile these hypotheses
25:02 uh or make correlations between what
25:05 they've
25:06 first heard
25:07 uh about the problems um and with that
25:10 there could be
25:12 a reason why customer churns
25:15 are happening
25:16 um and with
25:18 uh proper design
25:21 skills they can understand how to
25:24 address this or one fact find the root
25:27 cause for example for customer churn
25:29 um
25:30 they can find out whether it was due to
25:35 um a feature that was released on your
25:38 website that caused the customers to
25:40 be confused
25:42 and
25:44 miss on the click buy button
25:47 in
25:48 since that feature lunch
25:52 this has caused a reduction in sales
25:55 right so all of these working backwards
25:58 uh tasks help you identify what happened
26:02 whether it was an external event that
26:05 happened for example let's say that
26:08 covid was the event that caused
26:10 uh
26:12 a downturn on your sales right being
26:15 able to work backwards to figure out
26:16 that root cause
26:18 is what you know data scientists can do
26:21 uh when they're analyzing data
26:25 yeah thank you so we have a question
26:27 from peter and actually i have a similar
26:29 one so the question from peter is
26:31 what is product sense and
26:34 what i would add to this is is it
26:36 similar to product mindset
26:39 to me it seems like synonyms product
26:41 sense product mindset
26:42 and uh
26:44 what are these things so well
26:46 do you know
26:48 uh product sense i don't hear that often
26:51 but i can uh i have
26:53 an idea and there's no firm definition
26:56 for this
26:57 a product sense to me
27:00 is
27:02 a mindset i would say
27:05 the mindset of being able to
27:09 understand
27:10 where
27:12 uh understand the characteristics
27:15 and limitations
27:17 of your product
27:19 with regards to your customers needs
27:22 and being able to
27:24 derive a roadmap and strategy
27:27 that
27:28 address
27:30 these
27:33 expected and unexpected needs
27:36 of your customers
27:38 so understanding the trends
27:41 of these products the trends of the
27:43 market the trends of your customers
27:46 behaviors because needs change over time
27:49 so a product sense to me is more of a
27:52 mindset
27:54 that
27:55 entails different things from
27:57 understanding the external and internal
27:59 forces that drive the performance of
28:02 your product
28:04 and this is something that everyone can
28:06 have it's not only a thing to have for
28:09 product managers every
28:11 uh everyone on the team
28:14 data professional non-data professional
28:16 well i don't know who could be front-end
28:18 engineer back and engineer everyone can
28:20 have that right and it's uh about
28:24 how you said understanding
28:25 characteristics of your product right
28:28 understanding musicians yes limitations
28:31 and
28:32 we also mentioned defining road maps and
28:35 strategies right so this is also a part
28:37 of of that so how as a data professional
28:40 i can take part in defining roadmap
28:43 because i assume this is usually what a
28:45 product manager is doing right so how
28:47 can i help my product manager work on a
28:50 roadmap and what do i need for that
28:53 yeah um
28:55 so
28:56 if you're a data professional
28:58 um
28:59 you're
29:00 either on the busy stream other day as a
29:03 data analyst business analyst
29:05 or you're on the tech side
29:07 um
29:08 i mean even an ml engineer a data
29:11 engineer
29:13 etc
29:14 i think
29:16 uh
29:16 because product roadmaps are led by
29:20 uh product managers the best practices
29:23 for
29:24 involving all your stakeholders
29:27 into this because you need to understand
29:30 whether you will be able to deliver
29:33 what you promise to deliver
29:35 and uh that
29:38 especially the technical side will be
29:40 responsible for t-shirt sizing
29:43 the efforts
29:44 it takes to
29:46 you know deploy the key features
29:49 of your product
29:51 so as a data professional the
29:53 contribution that you can make is
29:56 uh
29:57 provide that that t-shirt t-shirt sizing
30:00 in terms of effort for example if a
30:03 feature requires
30:05 the build of
30:07 key data pipelines for example that
30:09 require
30:11 uh
30:12 real-time inference
30:14 from machine learning
30:16 a technical
30:17 a data professional on the technical
30:19 side is responsible for
30:22 uh providing advice and aligning on
30:25 timeline
30:27 uh
30:28 to ensure that the underlying
30:30 infrastructure
30:31 is either present or there's a strategy
30:34 for
30:34 establishing that infrastructure that
30:36 gives you those key pipelines
30:39 which in turn enable
30:41 these features that you want to release
30:42 in xyz time frame
30:44 so
30:45 when you think about it
30:47 it's definitely something that data
30:50 professionals are already doing
30:52 uh it's a matter of
30:54 whether your organization is
30:57 applying these best practices where
31:01 product managers are inviting everybody
31:03 at the table
31:05 to provide their
31:07 opinions and advice on how to move the
31:10 needle
31:14 and
31:14 what is this t-shirt sizing is it taking
31:17 something big and complex and chunking
31:19 it into smaller
31:20 things t-shirt sizing is simply
31:24 providing
31:27 how much how long does it take what is
31:29 the cost of me
31:31 spending time
31:32 to build this how long it will take me
31:34 to build this
31:36 et cetera et cetera so basically it's
31:39 determining the effort that it takes to
31:41 build something
31:44 and i guess another thing i'm not sure
31:46 we talked about this but you mentioned
31:48 it a few times that
31:50 you should start with an ant in mind
31:52 right and i guess this is something that
31:54 we also can do when let's say we discuss
31:57 a new feature
31:59 that
32:00 let's think what kind of problem we're
32:02 solving for the customer right and then
32:04 work backwards on that problem instead
32:07 of trying to
32:08 come up with a solution that technically
32:11 is interesting is good but doesn't
32:13 really solve the problem right
32:15 exactly so if you think about a product
32:17 manager
32:19 a data scientist's customer
32:22 is the product manager in this in this
32:24 case right
32:25 so when the product manager comes up
32:27 with
32:28 this roadmap that has a list of features
32:31 that are prioritized based on
32:34 the ones that speak
32:37 closer to
32:39 the business goals
32:41 then
32:42 you know as a
32:44 client to the data scientist the data
32:46 scientist needs to work backwards from
32:48 this
32:49 uh to figure out how
32:52 that solution will be delivered it's not
32:54 up to the product manager to
32:56 dictate
32:57 how that solution will be delivered for
33:00 example as a product manager i cannot go
33:02 to the engineers and say use this text
33:06 stack and use this text stack to deliver
33:09 this feature it should be
33:11 the engineer's responsibility to tell me
33:14 what is the best solution to achieve
33:16 this and their role is to gather the
33:18 requirements from me
33:20 meaning this feature requires high
33:23 availability
33:24 high
33:25 you know concurrency
33:27 low latency etc etc uh and then they
33:30 figure out how to design the final
33:33 product for me uh for the final release
33:37 okay so you would say that pm is more
33:39 problem oriented and data scientist is
33:41 more solution oriented right
33:43 they're both they're both solution
33:45 oriented if you think about it right a
33:47 pm is solution oriented for their
33:49 customer a data scientist installation
33:51 oriented for its customer who's the pm a
33:54 pm is a solution oriented for its
33:56 customer who's the external consumer
33:58 consumer so you know it depends on which
34:01 angle you're looking at this
34:02 uh they're both working and tandem to
34:06 provide a solution for
34:08 the ones they serve and you can abstract
34:10 that to any
34:12 position right whether
34:14 you're an accountant or
34:16 whether you're a supply chain manager or
34:19 your buyer or planner of production
34:22 um you're serving
34:24 a downstream customer
34:26 and you can create a roadmap and this is
34:28 why you think when you think about
34:30 roadmap
34:31 uh to me that's one of the most powerful
34:36 knowing how to build a roadmap is a very
34:38 powerful thing or tool
34:41 to use for career advancement
34:44 you don't have to be a product manager
34:46 to
34:47 be able to build a roadmap
34:49 for yourself as a supply chain
34:52 manager for example
34:54 right that that shows leadership that
34:56 you're thinking beyond
34:58 your daily
35:00 activities and you're thinking about
35:03 future transformation of your business
35:07 uh
35:08 and
35:09 that gets you promoted
35:11 because you're you're thinking about
35:12 future transformation you're thinking
35:14 about improvement you're thinking about
35:16 growth
35:17 of
35:18 your
35:19 department
35:20 and um it's a great skill to have
35:24 it's a great tool to use
35:26 it shouldn't be
35:28 uh bounded by uh product manager limited
35:31 to
35:32 product managers only
35:34 so how can i do that how can i build
35:36 this roadmap should i ask maybe
35:39 my product manager to help me or how do
35:41 i go about that
35:43 yeah so i guess
35:47 now
35:48 when i say
35:49 roadmap i can think about
35:52 us
35:53 a data scientist for example
35:56 building a roadmap is different than a
35:58 product manager building a roadmap
36:01 right so
36:03 a roadmap built by a data scientist
36:06 in
36:07 their group members
36:09 is going to be about building the
36:13 underlying infrastructure
36:15 that helps them better serve
36:17 um
36:19 uh
36:20 their clients for example
36:22 a group of product managers may come up
36:24 with
36:25 10 000 business use cases that require
36:29 some sort of ml algorithm to
36:32 um
36:34 to
36:34 address these use cases
36:37 so in a in a sense um
36:41 you know you can have a group of data
36:43 scientists
36:44 who strategize on how to implement
36:46 certain frameworks for example
36:48 um
36:50 in this case to keep up with all of
36:52 these demands and when i called what i
36:54 call demands are
36:56 all of these business use cases that
36:58 keep coming up these product managers
37:00 are coming to knock on their door and
37:01 say hey i need help
37:04 that's a good use case for building a
37:05 road map to for mlaps
37:09 right so figuring out all of the
37:12 different components of mlaps figuring
37:15 out assessing where you are today
37:17 and where you want to go tomorrow
37:20 to fully deploy
37:22 an mls framework that allows you to keep
37:25 up with all that demand
37:27 and that ml framework gives you the
37:29 right you know provide you know
37:32 the right supply that means the demand
37:34 of
37:35 of the business teams
37:37 so
37:38 um
37:39 again a roadmap for
37:41 a technical side may be different from
37:44 a roadmap for
37:46 a business
37:47 non-tech side
37:49 um but it's the same kind of talk
37:52 process
37:54 with regards to
37:56 you know having to focus on
37:59 the the customer in mind
38:02 so you don't want me to come up with a
38:04 bunch of requests
38:06 uh
38:07 and you can't answer to any of these
38:09 requests because you don't have the
38:10 underlying
38:11 infrastructure to support my demands
38:14 right so
38:15 i kind of have a plan to be able to
38:18 respond to this increased capacity here
38:21 so
38:21 again i'm thinking manufacturing
38:26 what i also heard from you maybe i don't
38:28 know if it's the right summary or not
38:30 but people come to let's say to me as a
38:33 data scientist with problems and these
38:35 are usually product managers or maybe
38:36 product analysts or
38:38 other people so they come to me with
38:40 problems and for me the ability to
38:42 generalize
38:44 all these problems and then see like the
38:46 bigger picture and then put all these
38:48 problems into roadmap and say okay with
38:50 this thing we can solve this bunch of
38:53 problems with this thing we can solve
38:54 this bunch of problems and then you see
38:56 the bigger picture so this is what we
38:58 mean by coming up with roadmap right
39:01 yeah coming up with a roadmap it's kind
39:03 of like understanding what strategy you
39:05 will use to serve your customers meaning
39:09 are you going to
39:11 uh deploy
39:12 a project
39:15 uh or assign a group of
39:17 tech folks to each product project
39:20 that you know the your customers come up
39:23 with
39:24 or are you going to build a framework
39:27 that can scale
39:29 to address these
39:31 these needs
39:32 so do you have a process in place
39:35 to understand
39:37 which of your models
39:40 can be
39:41 reused
39:42 for or repurposed
39:44 for different business use cases
39:47 versus having to go through the long
39:49 cycle of
39:50 project management right so
39:52 all of that is about you know what is
39:54 the vision for your
39:57 data
39:58 um
39:59 or tech department to serve its client
40:03 and how do you build that vision is to
40:06 is by identifying the issues the
40:09 obstacles that you've seen along the
40:11 road
40:12 uh
40:12 when you're
40:14 working
40:15 through the non-ski unscalable
40:18 uh
40:19 way
40:21 and what is that what is this
40:23 non-scalable way
40:24 so unscalable meaning like kind of
40:26 manual way so if you're
40:29 if you're having to
40:30 uh allocate time effort people resources
40:34 for each
40:35 business use case that come to you which
40:38 is a long cycle
40:40 of light project life cycle management
40:42 right
40:44 versus having an ml ups infrastructure
40:47 that allows you to quickly
40:50 uh
40:51 build test
40:52 deploy models to shorten these project
40:55 life cycles
40:57 you know so you'll have to
40:59 draw
41:00 that roadmap
41:02 uh that helps you get to that maturity
41:05 level because today you may make an
41:08 assessment
41:09 that helps you identify the gaps whether
41:12 you have
41:13 the right professionals
41:15 whether you have the right tech stack
41:18 um
41:19 and whether you have you know the right
41:21 skills to manage
41:22 uh these tech stacks
41:25 and you need to decide
41:27 inside of that roadmap
41:29 which of these
41:31 are most important that you need to go
41:34 after by prioritizing
41:36 until you get there so it's all about
41:39 drawing the roadmap to maturity level
41:43 and you you i think you set multiple
41:45 times driving the roadmap so
41:48 does it mean that let's say i work in a
41:50 team so this is a team it has a product
41:53 manager a bunch of other people me so we
41:56 have this team and then driving the
41:58 roadmap of this team means that taking
42:00 active part in discussions when we talk
42:03 about what we want to solve next
42:05 and
42:08 say
42:09 things there about okay i think this is
42:11 the problem we should be focusing on
42:13 right now
42:14 and being able to defend this position
42:16 to convince everyone on the team that
42:18 this is indeed the problem and we as a
42:20 team should focus on solving this
42:22 problem let's say in the next quarter
42:23 right this is what it means to drive the
42:26 roadmap
42:27 yeah so so
42:28 to me a road map should be a three-year
42:30 plan um
42:32 never less or never more
42:35 um
42:36 a three-year plan because something
42:39 that is a roadmap for five years
42:42 is quite
42:43 loose
42:44 because nobody really knows what's going
42:46 to happen in five years in terms of
42:48 trends so you have a better sense of
42:52 the future trends or
42:54 uh
42:55 within the next five years next three
42:57 years
42:58 and then
43:00 um
43:01 inside of those three years you kind of
43:03 prioritize what you want to go after
43:06 for example if your biggest needs inside
43:08 of that roadmap is we need more people
43:11 we need more specialized folks
43:13 we need
43:14 more data engineers because we cannot
43:16 keep up with
43:17 these demands to
43:20 uh build key data pipelines
43:22 that serve different purpose so we need
43:25 to hire
43:26 more and better qualified data engineers
43:28 or we need to create a strategy for
43:31 uh
43:32 uh
43:33 putting better training materials for
43:35 these data engineers so they can
43:37 keep up with the industry et cetera et
43:38 cetera so you kind of identify the
43:41 limitations that you have
43:43 and then
43:44 prioritize
43:46 um
43:47 the solutions to these limitations
43:50 over the next three years
43:52 and you're prioritized by
43:54 what you need the most
43:56 to what you need the least
43:58 and also you're prioritized by how much
44:00 effort whether you want to buy a
44:02 third-party software or you want to
44:04 build it from the ground up
44:06 uh the cost the effort the impact also
44:11 right the impact is big because
44:13 maybe hiring more data engineers
44:16 gives you a better return on your
44:17 investment with regards to being able to
44:20 create
44:21 pipelines that serve downstream
44:23 customers
44:25 so again a roadmap is inside of three
44:27 years
44:28 accounts for
44:29 impact
44:30 effort
44:31 cost
44:32 timeline so you can kind of draw the map
44:35 for
44:36 it strategize on what you need to focus
44:38 on
44:40 is it would you say it's more like a
44:41 project management skill or product
44:43 manager skill it's a product manager
44:46 skill
44:47 so like when i think about like cost
44:49 impact or all that to me this is like
44:51 you have like a project that you need to
44:53 finish this is different right this is
44:55 this is different this is different uh
44:58 think about roadmap as future
45:00 transformation
45:02 of a
45:04 product or
45:06 a system
45:08 or department
45:11 um
45:13 and the strategy that helps you get
45:16 there
45:17 from point a to point b
45:20 and uh yeah three years uh
45:22 long plan seems like quite a while right
45:25 so how do you go about that like if if i
45:28 don't even know what happens in one
45:30 quarter or half a year how do i plan for
45:32 three years that's quite a
45:35 long term plan to me
45:37 yeah to me that's more of a think big
45:40 kind of kind of thing
45:42 uh and then don't forget
45:44 you have
45:46 a three-year road map
45:49 if
45:50 if it's more than five years then
45:53 you're kind of shooting in
45:56 you know
45:58 in the air with no aim
46:00 if it's three years it's a good estimate
46:03 of what you the future needs are it's
46:06 being able to anticipate
46:08 where the trends are going right being
46:10 able to anticipate
46:12 what the future needs of your customers
46:14 will be so that gives you a good thing
46:17 and remember a roadmap is not a static
46:21 uh strategy
46:22 it's an adaptive
46:24 strategy
46:25 so you give yourself three years once
46:28 you have alignment on this roadmap you
46:30 start working
46:32 at year one
46:33 on what you
46:35 decide
46:37 for what's more important but
46:39 things change in the market and your
46:41 roadmap needs to be up to date
46:43 so a roadmap that you ride for today for
46:46 the next two years will change next year
46:48 most of most likely because the needs of
46:51 your customers will change with it
46:53 so don't think about the roadmap as a
46:56 static
46:57 um
46:59 document but more of a dynamic one
47:02 that
47:03 provides flexibility
47:06 and even proactiveness
47:08 um
47:10 and being able to anticipate
47:12 what
47:13 your customers will do and what their
47:15 needs will be
47:17 and how can i best learn uh these skills
47:20 so there is a actually a question from
47:22 patricia is how can we best increase
47:25 develop our roadmaps and building our
47:28 roadmaps
47:29 roadmap building skills is there
47:32 a good resource maybe there is a product
47:34 management course that we as data
47:36 scientists can take to learn these
47:38 things or we just need to watch uh date
47:41 product managers uh how they do their
47:43 job and learn from them
47:46 yeah um
47:47 i haven't found any
47:50 or i don't know of any specific product
47:52 management
47:53 um you you probably can
47:55 youtube or or google
47:58 how to build a product roadmap
48:00 and kind of pull
48:02 the
48:04 skills from this and apply it to your
48:06 department
48:08 but i'm not sure there is like a set
48:12 uh
48:13 way of doing so
48:15 um you can come up with your own
48:17 framework for this for me it's about
48:21 one again
48:23 starting with the end in mind which is
48:25 what is the problem
48:27 that
48:28 you're
48:29 experiencing right now so list all of
48:32 your problems in a
48:34 excel sheet
48:36 each row each each row has your prop
48:39 list of problems in the column heads are
48:43 the problem
48:45 the
48:46 driver of this problem or potential root
48:48 cause of this problem
48:50 then you can have another column called
48:53 justification for
48:55 a or you can have another column called
48:57 solution or potential solution
49:00 then after solution you can have a
49:03 justification
49:05 um
49:06 and then
49:07 after justification
49:09 you can have uh stakeholders
49:12 affected
49:14 um
49:14 that would be affected
49:16 then you have
49:17 um impact what is the impact of that
49:21 solution so is it uh
49:23 a better customer experience
49:26 improvement uh a customer experience
49:28 improvement is it an uplift
49:31 in
49:32 sales
49:33 that solution gives you
49:35 um
49:36 and then you have a column for effort
49:39 where you can estimate but you need to
49:42 uh if you're already on the tech side
49:44 you can kind of
49:45 better understand what the effort will
49:47 be there
49:48 and then you have uh smart goals
49:51 uh the smart metric for that solution
49:55 is time bound
49:57 in measurable
49:59 that's another column that i would add
50:01 in a roadmap and then the last column i
50:03 would say
50:04 would be
50:05 um
50:07 prioritization
50:09 is it a priority number one number two
50:12 number three
50:13 then once you fill up all of that
50:15 excel file you can kind of filter by
50:18 priority where you prioritize p1's
50:22 first
50:23 and then in terms of that smart goal
50:26 you will
50:27 um
50:28 know
50:30 when you need to deliver based on the
50:32 effort so some of these and there will
50:34 be trade-offs right so there could be
50:36 something
50:37 with high impact
50:40 that may take six months to build
50:43 or you're going to prioritize that
50:45 versus
50:46 prioritizing three smaller
50:48 effort
50:50 you know
50:52 solutions
50:53 that can come combined can give you the
50:56 same impact as working on one that can
50:59 give you a big impact so you have to
51:01 understand
51:02 how to make trade-offs between all of
51:04 this list so there you go i just created
51:07 a quick framework for building a roadmap
51:10 for your department
51:11 yeah thanks that's uh that's useful and
51:14 also there is a question from elena
51:16 about setting up
51:18 metrics
51:19 for
51:20 internal data platform so i think that's
51:22 also interesting and this is something
51:24 that
51:24 um i think product managers also do
51:27 right so let's say we have a problem we
51:28 want to solve this problem
51:30 now we need to think
51:32 how can we actually measure that we are
51:33 solving this problem is it correct is it
51:36 something that
51:37 product managers do
51:39 it's a
51:40 product management 101 especially in
51:42 designing solutions for their customers
51:45 so you want to identify
51:47 the affected customers you want to
51:49 identify
51:51 the pain points
51:52 you want to brainstorm what that north
51:55 star is
51:57 uh
51:58 for these pain points
52:00 meaning the vision
52:01 of
52:03 a product that would solve these pain
52:04 points and also you want to describe
52:07 exactly what that question is asking
52:09 describe what the success criteria is
52:12 in that success criteria success
52:14 criteria is what is in that success
52:17 criteria is where you embed those
52:19 success metrics
52:21 so
52:22 for you a solution maybe
52:24 you want to reduce latency
52:27 of the data pipelines that you serve the
52:29 downstream team for example or you want
52:30 to reduce sla service level agreement
52:34 uh
52:35 for your teams
52:36 uh you want to
52:38 uh increase engagement
52:41 on your website
52:43 right engagement you're looking to
52:46 increase that by ten percent
52:48 uh
52:49 you want to
52:50 increase
52:51 uh reduce customer return i mean
52:54 uh
52:55 product management design 101
52:57 success criteria
52:59 with those success metrics are key
53:02 uh to
53:04 test
53:05 to monitor
53:06 and validate
53:08 that
53:09 the solution you've implemented
53:12 was effective
53:15 this comes to a smart uh
53:18 the smart framework you mentioned that m
53:20 there is measurable right so we always
53:22 need to think about a way to measure
53:24 that we're actually solving this problem
53:26 right correct and i think that the
53:29 question was about uh internal data
53:31 platforms
53:32 and
53:33 i think uh let's say i can imagine
53:35 myself what kind of problems i might
53:38 have with a data platform maybe there
53:40 are data quality issues right and then
53:42 uh yeah how can we measure that well
53:45 fewer people complain for example right
53:47 or
53:47 some other
53:49 other ways of measuring them and then it
53:51 can can become your you know success
53:53 criteria fewer people complain about
53:56 quality and then i don't know we can
53:57 track complaints and then after half a
53:59 year if there are no complaints we can
54:01 call it uh pipeline pipeline failures
54:04 for example okay
54:05 are you experiencing less pipeline
54:07 failures
54:08 um you know are you
54:10 addressing
54:12 your pipeline failures in this
54:14 within the service level agreement that
54:17 you established for example you may say
54:20 high priority
54:22 business critical pipelines when they
54:24 fail
54:25 you have your service level agreement of
54:27 48 hours
54:28 so
54:29 your success criteria is anything 48
54:32 hours or under
54:34 uh
54:35 you know you you can use that as a
54:36 metric you can say
54:39 98 of your pipeline failures business
54:42 critical pipeline failures
54:44 will be addressed
54:46 inside of that agreed upon service level
54:48 agreement
54:49 so with that
54:50 98 is your success metric so you need to
54:54 do
54:55 that or exceed it
54:56 and that's another metric for
54:59 internal
55:00 you know
55:01 but there are many others that you can
55:04 you can think of
55:05 but that's one easy one that i can think
55:07 about
55:09 and uh yeah here i guess when you
55:12 do this exercise that you mentioned for
55:15 coming up with a roadmap and you do this
55:17 expel excel spreadsheet
55:20 if you
55:21 fill all the columns it will give you
55:24 a lot of great ideas what the right
55:26 metrics can be right how can we measure
55:28 that we're actually solving these pin
55:29 points
55:30 correct
55:32 and another question i have for you is i
55:36 know that there are teams who do not
55:37 have product managers for some reasons i
55:40 have worked in such a teams at some
55:42 point
55:43 and i know that
55:45 what can happen in such a team is people
55:48 work on solving problems that don't
55:50 exist i have
55:52 tried solving problems that don't exist
55:54 and then i was surprised why is my
55:56 solution is not used right so do you
55:59 have any
56:00 recommendations what people in such
56:02 teams can do when they don't have
56:04 product managers who can tell them hey
56:06 you're
56:07 doing something that is not useful like
56:09 how
56:10 can we make sure that our projects in
56:12 these teams are more successful
56:14 yeah um whether you have a product
56:17 manager or not um you have a customer
56:20 so if you're a data science team or data
56:23 team
56:24 uh you're doing some work for somebody
56:27 downstream to consume
56:29 so the first thing i would say is
56:31 identify those folks
56:32 and identify the business decision
56:34 makers or the decision makers of these
56:38 departments that you serve
56:40 so who are the decision makers
56:43 um identify them and interview them
56:46 and surface these pain points and then
56:49 brainstorm ideas to tackle these pain
56:52 points and use data
56:54 uh to
56:56 brainstorm ideas uh and use data
56:59 to solve these ideas that's probably the
57:02 most powerful thing that data scientists
57:04 have right
57:05 they use data to explore they use data
57:07 to solve
57:08 so
57:09 um
57:11 at the end of the day
57:13 you know you may not need you may find
57:15 and it depends on the company culture
57:17 you may find that you don't need the
57:18 middleman you don't need the product
57:19 manager to
57:21 kind of
57:22 guide you in this
57:23 journey you just need to understand
57:26 who your customers are who you serve
57:29 and what are they trying to solve and
57:30 how you solve them for solve them for
57:33 so
57:34 um
57:35 best practice is
57:37 get in touch with
57:39 can in touch with the decision makers
57:44 yeah i remember
57:45 apm who i worked with in my team
57:47 he said that he would call himself
57:50 himself successful if a team no longer
57:53 needs him that a team can autonomously
57:55 function without him come up with all
57:57 these roadmaps
57:59 and all these things and i thought
58:00 that's an interesting thought
58:02 like uh if a team no longer needs him
58:05 uh what is he going to do but that's
58:07 that's an interesting thing i guess he
58:09 will move on to a different team that
58:12 maybe needs still needs yeah i think i
58:14 think
58:14 i think what he said or she said is more
58:17 of a mental model piece right so
58:20 when the when the technical team no
58:21 longer needs
58:23 a pm is it's because
58:26 mental models are aligned and that makes
58:28 an even more powerful team
58:30 that tackles
58:33 true
58:34 problems and work on the right things
58:37 right so mental models are aligned on
58:39 the right things
58:40 so
58:42 yeah okay i think we should be wrapping
58:44 up so do you want to say anything uh
58:46 before we finish
58:49 yeah so i guess my message is you know
58:52 wherever you are
58:54 um be open to
58:55 learning different things i i think
58:58 you may hear on
59:00 more conversation about
59:02 data professionals or data scientists ml
59:05 engineers software engineers who want to
59:08 transition to
59:09 product
59:11 based positions you know um
59:14 you know you don't have to wait until
59:16 you're ready to move
59:18 or you're ready to make your next career
59:20 move to
59:21 to learn about
59:23 the skills you can
59:25 learn about these skills on the job at
59:28 your current job
59:30 right
59:30 you know being open to learn
59:33 a skill outside of your
59:35 immediate
59:37 um
59:38 responsibilities
59:40 or outside of your skill sets
59:42 makes you that much more powerful
59:45 at your current job and gets you
59:48 promoted faster
59:50 and be open to learning
59:53 something outside of your daily
59:55 responsibilities
59:56 and
59:58 you know
59:59 hopefully that everyone who listened
1:00:01 there
1:00:02 um take that as inspiration to
1:00:05 uh
1:00:06 have a great career and
1:00:08 you're in charge don't forget to ask
1:00:11 when you want to get from point a to
1:00:13 point b
1:00:15 whether it's in your career or whether
1:00:16 you want to understand the pain point of
1:00:18 of a customer ask
1:00:21 um
1:00:22 and
1:00:23 again you know best of luck i'm
1:00:25 happy to
1:00:27 you know
1:00:28 if anybody can
1:00:30 follow me on
1:00:31 linkedin
