0:57 okay this week we'll talk about moving
0:59 from academia to industry and we have a
1:02 special guest today cj cj worked as a
1:04 postdoctoral researcher at martin luther
1:07 university which is university in
1:08 germany and then she decided to move
1:10 into data science since 2018 she's been
1:14 working as a data scientist and now she
1:16 is a data science lead welcome cj
1:19 how's it going
1:21 now let's start with your background can
1:23 you tell us about your career journey so
1:25 far
1:26 yeah
1:28 um i was an evolutionary biologist for a
1:31 long time um so i started i did my
1:34 undergraduate master's in phd in
1:35 evolutionary biology um and then
1:40 six months before i finished my phd i
1:42 was thinking i was like i'm not sure i
1:43 want to stay in academia but that is not
1:46 the time to make life-changing decisions
1:48 so i just put my head down uh finished
1:51 up i was like i can figure this out
1:52 during my postdoc and then about a year
1:54 and a half into a three-year postdoc i
1:55 was like
1:57 i don't think i want to do this anymore
1:59 um so i shifted gears studied a bunch uh
2:02 and got an awesome job in industry in
2:04 berlin and i've been a data scientist
2:06 ever since what's evolutional
2:10 evolutionary biology so what is that
2:11 very good question
2:13 um it looks at how populations of
2:15 organisms evolve over time right so
2:18 uh when people see hear evolutionary
2:21 biology and then they're like and then
2:22 you ended up in technology and i was
2:24 like hear me out
2:26 uh so because evolution happens to a
2:28 population instead of an individual
2:31 it's rooted a lot in statistics and so
2:34 i think that was one of my edges of
2:35 getting my first data science job is
2:37 that i knew
2:39 more about statistics than
2:41 anybody else in the room and because i'd
2:43 been doing you know building prod like
2:45 building experiments writing statistics
2:47 on the data i was collecting teaching my
2:48 students how to do statistics you know
2:50 teaching statistics within the courses
2:53 um
2:55 and so i had this really solid
2:56 foundation uh but on top of that because
2:58 evolution looks at how populations
3:00 change over time it's really rooted
3:02 solidly in math and differential
3:03 equations and looking at like how
3:05 population dynamics can change
3:07 and so um so yeah it's literally just
3:09 looking at how populations evolve but it
3:11 gave me a really strong background
3:14 for things that i ended up using in data
3:15 science
3:16 yeah because
3:18 to prepare for this interview i was
3:20 going through your linkedin profile and
3:22 actually i got an impression that you
3:24 were doing also
3:26 data science stuff
3:28 back when you were in the in the
3:30 academia
3:34 data science stuff because i think
3:35 that's an interesting question it says
3:37 so i so it says i have a code many so
3:41 you were doing uh these things
3:43 manipulating big data sets analysis of a
3:45 b tests working in environments of large
3:48 and complex data structures commonly
3:50 applied
3:53 advanced statistical and machine
3:54 learning techniques
3:56 yeah so
3:57 this sounds like a usual data science
3:59 job yeah yeah and absolutely there was
4:02 you know and it's funny because i still
4:04 rely on a lot of those tools right so
4:05 like a lot of genomic data is
4:07 unstructured text files of full of
4:10 sequent reads that are like you know
4:12 three to four gigabytes each and like
4:13 figuring out how to process those and
4:15 bash requires
4:16 like a certain programming knowledge but
4:18 the things that i was missing were like
4:20 the deployment component right like i
4:22 had to google what an api was when i
4:24 first started as a data scientist and i
4:25 had to
4:26 figure out what infrastructure was what
4:28 a docker container was um and all those
4:29 things so i had i think the theoretical
4:32 understanding and the backing i like a
4:33 lot of the coding done but i you can ask
4:36 anybody at my first job my first three
4:38 months i just like walked around with
4:39 this look of tear around my face because
4:41 i was like i have no idea what i'm doing
4:44 when i figured it out yeah did you need
4:46 to learn any machine learning or you
4:48 basically knew everything you needed for
4:50 oh no i had to learn a lot of machine
4:52 learning um most of the background i had
4:54 in machine learning was very much based
4:55 on statistical models and so like they
4:57 took my first machine learning course
4:58 and i was like everyone's been talking
5:00 about how it was a buzz like machine
5:01 learning machine learning and then i
5:03 looked at it and i was like
5:05 the first one you guys talk about is
5:06 linear regression and like a logistic
5:08 regression i was like those are just
5:10 statistical methods like that i've been
5:12 using for years
5:13 and so actually my first case study um
5:17 for my first job was uh like you're
5:20 supposed to build a predictive model so
5:22 you could predict transactions of
5:24 individuals
5:25 um and i sort of cheated because i was
5:27 like there's the data was too sparse and
5:29 so i just made a proof of concept by
5:30 combining the data and then like
5:32 predicting the mean but i use a
5:34 generalized linear model so it was just
5:36 like a
5:37 uh it was a glm that was tied to
5:41 poisson distribution i think i can't
5:43 remember the exact distribution i used
5:44 but it was
5:46 like just a statistical model
5:49 so basically you had enough foundation
5:51 to
5:52 so for you the theoretical part of data
5:54 science theoretical part of machine
5:55 learning wasn't scary you could just you
5:58 could just watch a course and then apply
6:00 everything you learned and quickly grasp
6:02 all these things so that in that sense
6:05 the background you've had as a
6:06 researcher helped you a lot exactly yeah
6:10 and then for the things you didn't know
6:11 so you mentioned you didn't know
6:13 anything about deployment you didn't
6:14 know anything about
6:16 you didn't know what api is
6:18 docker all this stuff yep did you have
6:20 to learn this on your on the job or you
6:22 had to learn this okay not before
6:24 getting a job right no i feel like i got
6:27 really lucky and so it's one of those
6:28 things like i said i get asked a lot
6:30 from academics like how do i move into
6:31 industry and i was like the unfortunate
6:33 truth is is like i got really lucky with
6:35 time and place and uh
6:38 and i moved there at a time where i
6:39 think the field is really competitive
6:41 now uh but
6:43 i was very
6:45 and they also talked about this a lot at
6:46 n26 which is my first job they came back
6:49 from my interview and just looked at
6:50 everybody else in the team and they're
6:51 like she said everything you're not
6:53 supposed to say in an interview but i
6:55 was very open with them i was like
6:56 here's a list of things that i'm bad at
6:58 and you know uh but i really want to
7:01 learn from you guys i was like i don't
7:02 know everything but i want to learn um
7:04 but one of those i was like i didn't
7:06 know python when i started uh so i had
7:08 to learn that on the job i didn't know
7:10 um and a lot and i
7:12 if i'm being totally honest i didn't
7:13 know exactly
7:15 what a position in data science was
7:17 going to look like right so i had this
7:19 my sister was asking me ahead of time
7:21 she's like what are you going to do and
7:22 i was like you know manipulate data use
7:24 data to gain insights like make data
7:26 into value and she's like yeah none of
7:28 those mean anything i was like i know
7:30 but until i started the job i wasn't
7:32 sure what that was going to be and then
7:34 it was a hard crash course but i think
7:37 there were a couple things that helped
7:38 me succeed so one is that
7:41 and a couple of them came from academia
7:43 so one thing in academia
7:45 is that you need to be able to teach
7:46 yourself stuff stuff right so at this
7:48 point i had 14 years experience teaching
7:50 myself how to do things and teaching
7:52 myself how to learn things um and so i
7:54 did a lot of that and
7:56 i think uh one of my colleagues is
7:58 listening so they can attest to this
8:00 that uh my com everybody else in this
8:02 company started at ten so they keep four
8:04 hours or ten to six
8:05 and i was usually in the office like
8:07 between six and seven and i spent those
8:10 hours between like you know whenever i
8:12 got in in 10 when 10 30 when our team
8:14 did our stand-up just learning new
8:16 things and everyone's like you know you
8:17 don't need to be in here this early and
8:18 i was like you know i don't actually
8:19 know what i'm doing yet right
8:21 so i spent a lot of time
8:23 uh then figuring it out and then i had
8:25 incredible colleagues who were willing
8:27 to sit down and do a lot of pair
8:29 programming with me which is like still
8:30 my favorite tool um with new peoples
8:32 just to sit down and have two people
8:34 working together to solve the problem
8:36 and then i could see how to solve the
8:37 problems by myself
8:39 but yeah i didn't know any of that when
8:40 i started that's that's cool i'm
8:43 i'm just trying to think uh so some
8:46 people are listening for this and
8:48 thinking and i think okay now i also
8:50 have this theoretical foundation
8:52 i know
8:54 statistics well i know machine learning
8:56 well but how can i convince a potential
8:58 employer that
9:00 they should hire me and then i learn
9:02 everything on the job like let's say
9:04 uh if you don't know python if you don't
9:06 know deployment you don't know api all
9:09 you know you know statistics well you
9:11 know machine learning so how do you
9:13 convince
9:15 an employer to hire you and then you how
9:18 do you convince them that you will learn
9:20 everything let's say in three months and
9:22 will be able to start being useful
9:24 that's a very good question and again i
9:26 think i got really lucky but um
9:29 from the other side now so like now i'm
9:30 leading and building data team and so i
9:33 can speak to what i look for
9:35 in people who might not have a lot of
9:36 experience and i am like specifically
9:38 going to be hiring two new junior people
9:41 uh in the spring but um
9:44 what i'm looking for is three things
9:45 right
9:46 like
9:47 that they're
9:48 reasonably smart right like that they
9:49 can pick up on concepts quickly
9:51 that they
9:52 um
9:53 are able to learn or know that they have
9:55 the ambition to learn right they're open
9:57 to learning and trying
9:59 new things and that they can take
10:00 feedback right
10:02 so if you're not open to learning new
10:04 things and you're stuck in your way it's
10:05 gonna be a problem
10:07 um and if you
10:08 get really defensive when i say like hey
10:11 maybe you should do this differently
10:12 then it's gonna make it hard but if you
10:14 have those three things i don't care
10:15 what you know right like i can teach you
10:17 anything
10:18 but if you have those three things then
10:20 like those are the kind of people that
10:21 you want to invest in as a junior so
10:23 from the counterpoint if it was
10:24 somebody who's like how can i get my
10:26 foot in the door i think
10:28 demonstrating those things like
10:30 you know you don't have to i don't want
10:32 to i don't need to see your crazy cv or
10:34 crazy portfolio especially for a junior
10:35 position or an entry position
10:37 i want to see that you have
10:39 the ability to pick up things quickly
10:40 and that you can take feedback
10:42 how do you test this during the
10:43 interview
10:45 i'm brutal uh no i'm actually really
10:47 nice
10:48 [Laughter]
10:50 um so
10:52 so like that's the
10:53 i think this is one of those things you
10:55 think a lot has been academic uh it's
10:56 like how do you define smart and so you
10:59 can see and because
11:01 this is one of those skills that
11:02 transferred really well um is it's
11:04 somebody's ability to
11:06 like absorb and synthesize new
11:07 information right so like figure out
11:09 what that i'm telling them and then
11:10 synthesize it with what they already
11:12 know and you can just ask questions
11:14 about like
11:14 you know uh
11:17 tell me about a problem that you've
11:19 worked on and then i'll start throwing
11:20 stuff like curveballs at them and be
11:22 like oh do you mean like this and see
11:23 how they respond to that right
11:25 and then if they can take feedback i
11:26 just flat out ask them i was like tell
11:27 me about a time when you were wrong
11:29 you know and i think that's a very
11:30 different question i had somebody answer
11:32 this the other day
11:33 and they told me about a time that they
11:34 had failed and i was like that's not
11:36 what i was asking i was like tell me
11:37 about a time when you were wrong like i
11:38 can give you a list of the ways that i'm
11:40 wrong i'm going to run a whole series at
11:41 one of the universities in stockholm
11:42 about ways that machine learning
11:44 algorithms and production fail
11:45 but like i think like being able to
11:47 admit like hey i was wrong about this
11:50 and like this is what i wanted to learn
11:51 from that and here's how it changed in
11:52 the future means that you're open to the
11:54 possibility that you can be wrong and
11:55 you're open to other people to tell you
11:57 that i think that's important
11:59 since you mentioned that you'll be some
12:01 fighting juniors i guess many people are
12:03 taking notes right now
12:10 yeah
12:11 yeah but uh yeah that's tricky to
12:13 to check like
12:14 [Music]
12:15 all these three things
12:17 and
12:19 but i guess companies also they check
12:22 the theoretical background right so like
12:25 how well you know all these things
12:27 do you remember how the interview
12:29 actually looked like for you like when
12:30 you were transitioning like the
12:32 interview within 26. yeah i remember it
12:34 very distinctly i have a good memory but
12:36 this one stands out in my mind because
12:38 it was like such a weird experience but
12:40 yeah
12:42 um the what the interview process was or
12:44 like
12:45 okay it was really easy um so i had
12:49 i got so lucky i had a friend in berlin
12:52 who had gone on a tinder date with a guy
12:55 at n26 and she still contacted him and
12:58 so she told me she was like cj
13:00 do you need a hookup and i was like
13:01 because that was you know i applied to
13:03 four positions this again look i applied
13:06 to four positions
13:07 i had one interview i got the job and it
13:10 was like my number one choice and so
13:11 like this doesn't happen anymore like
13:13 this is not something that happens these
13:15 days i got lucky
13:16 but um but so
13:18 and 26 i skipped the recruiting step
13:21 because i was a referral
13:23 and they sent me a case study and i
13:25 spent like a solid week working really
13:27 hard on this case study
13:28 um
13:29 and at the time all of their deployments
13:31 were in python but at the time they said
13:33 you could do this in python and r
13:35 um
13:36 because they're like we don't care about
13:37 the programming language you just want
13:38 to see that you know the
13:39 the concepts and so i did it in r
13:40 because that was my native language
13:42 and so
13:43 sent in this case study
13:46 a week later they contact me
13:48 we'd like to interview you i was like
13:50 okay cool
13:52 and so i sat down with the two data
13:53 scientists at n26 at the time and
13:57 like i said it was like an hour and a
13:58 half interview and i was just like you
14:00 know here all the things i don't know
14:01 and like
14:03 i'm really excited to learn from you
14:04 guys and
14:06 all the things you're not supposed to
14:07 say in an interview but i think they
14:08 appreciated the honesty and i felt like
14:11 i felt more
14:12 confident from that point forward
14:14 because i was like they know exactly
14:15 what they're getting right like i don't
14:16 have to have imposter syndrome like they
14:18 know my failings before i get in the
14:19 door i don't have to pretend to be
14:21 because everybody else hasn't said did
14:22 you fake it till you make it i was like
14:23 no absolutely not
14:25 um
14:26 and then after that uh it was two weeks
14:28 and then i had a uh interview with the
14:31 uh at the time cdo um so chief data
14:34 officer
14:35 and
14:36 and he was just like and i'd studied
14:39 python in between i was like you know no
14:40 python terms and uh
14:43 and yeah he at one point literally pulls
14:46 out a computer and was like walk me
14:47 through what this python code is doing
14:49 and i could pick up logically what was
14:50 happening but i didn't know any of the
14:52 syntax and so
14:53 we talked about that and then you know
14:56 two days later i had a job offer
14:58 yeah that's that's pretty impressive
15:01 yeah it was very easy it was it was a
15:03 lot of luck but i walked out of the
15:04 first interview and keep in mind up to
15:06 this point i've had 14 years as an
15:07 academic right so
15:09 i've spent my whole life in labs and
15:11 universities
15:12 and i walk out of this interview in this
15:14 like super cool like startup tech like
15:16 everyone walking around looking like
15:18 cool startup tech people office and i
15:20 get to the sidewalk and i just bent over
15:23 laughing so hard
15:25 i can't believe this is my life right
15:27 now i can't believe that this is where i
15:29 am but i was like it was time to leave
15:31 academia and so i was like i guess we're
15:33 moving forward but yeah it's bizarre
15:36 did it take a lot of time for you to
15:38 like when the idea occurred to you that
15:40 okay you want to try something else to
15:43 actually you know
15:45 your first day at 10 26
15:47 yeah it was about a year a little over a
15:49 year so i
15:50 um i was in london
15:52 uh which is one of my favorite cities in
15:53 the world
15:54 uh visiting a friend in january and i
15:57 it hit me like all of a sudden i was
15:59 like it had been building up for a while
16:01 so i was like death by a thousand cuts
16:02 but that was the final cut
16:04 where i was just like i want to be able
16:05 to choose
16:06 to live in a city like this someday and
16:09 if i stay in academia that's never going
16:10 to be possible
16:12 right i'm not going to be able to make
16:13 choices about my life i'm not going to
16:14 choose where i want to live never going
16:16 to have enough money to do things like
16:17 this
16:18 and i was like so
16:20 it's time to go it's but i looked at my
16:22 schedule and i was like at that point in
16:24 january i had committed to
16:26 a number of i committed to teaching that
16:28 spring i committed to field season that
16:30 summer i had a couple phd students and
16:32 masters students i needed to get get
16:34 into a good position before i left them
16:36 and i had a huge talk that i've been
16:38 given
16:39 invited to give a talk at this
16:40 conference
16:41 at the end of august and so i was just
16:43 like okay i'm gonna shelve that idea
16:46 until august and so i just worked really
16:47 hard as an academic knowing i was going
16:49 to leave but continued working really
16:50 hard
16:51 until the end of august and then i came
16:53 back from the conference and completely
16:54 shifted gears
16:56 and tried you know rewrote my cv
17:00 did a coursera specialization in data
17:02 science to get more broad view of it
17:04 uh and then started applying to berlin
17:06 and the or applying to companies in
17:08 berlin in the middle of november and
17:10 started at n26 in the beginning of
17:13 february
17:14 okay can you tell us a bit
17:16 about this uh rewriting your cv because
17:20 i told you that when i was reading your
17:22 linkedin and i don't know how many
17:23 iterations uh you did there but it sound
17:26 very
17:27 data science
17:29 related stuff yeah so i could see like
17:31 you already if you're doing all these
17:33 data science
17:34 science stuff before you were officially
17:36 doing this
17:37 but i didn't know that yeah i guess this
17:39 is uh like more like a framing question
17:42 like how do you put all these 14 years
17:44 of experience in such a way that people
17:46 want to hire you yeah it was hard it was
17:49 and i'm very again i'm super lucky i had
17:51 really good friends who were willing to
17:52 help me
17:53 uh and because i had really good friends
17:55 who were willing to help me who had been
17:56 in industry for a while i am now
17:59 always i mean people are going to
18:01 contact me now but i'm always willing to
18:02 help other people like random people
18:05 ping me on linkedin and be like hey
18:07 you know and i'm just like yeah i'll
18:08 look at your cv like yeah we can talk
18:10 through interview like yeah of course
18:11 i'm happy you know i'm pretty active on
18:13 the data talks career channel because
18:15 i'm like i had help i couldn't do this
18:18 by myself and so i feel like i owe the
18:20 world like uh help in return because i
18:22 got really lucky but so my friend um
18:25 penny and i because i was like okay how
18:26 do i rewrite my cv it's like six pages
18:28 long
18:29 um i know nobody's gonna read that in
18:31 industry and so my friend penny and i
18:33 did a weekend trip to italy and she's
18:34 like bring your computer and i was like
18:35 okay
18:36 and we're in cinque terre and she hands
18:38 me a bottle of wine she takes my
18:40 computer and she looks my cv and she
18:43 highlights all of the talks and all of
18:45 the publications and then she hits the
18:47 delete button and i was like oh
18:51 i was like that basically hurts and just
18:53 like drink the line
18:55 then i you know i had her to help and
18:57 then i had a couple of
18:59 i reached out to a couple of female data
19:01 scientists and i was like you know how
19:03 do i do this and they're like you need
19:04 to emphasize the skills that you have
19:07 that that you've developed in industry
19:09 rather than the things that you've done
19:11 right so
19:12 instead of talking about like this is
19:14 the research i did during my phd i was
19:16 like here are the skills that i learned
19:17 while doing the research during my phd
19:20 and so i you know
19:22 didn't plagiarize but i would read other
19:24 people's stuff and be like oh that also
19:25 applies to me you're like oh that's also
19:28 something that i can put on my list
19:29 you're like oh and then like
19:30 reformatting it so you know but the
19:32 education section was at the bottom and
19:34 like you know like
19:35 the it doesn't matter anymore where i
19:37 went to school or like what my degrees
19:39 are
19:40 but like rather like what the skills
19:42 were that i picked up while i was doing
19:43 those and and and reform it but it was
19:45 it was genuinely like i
19:47 i had good friends and was very lucky
19:49 and a nice bottle of wine because oh it
19:52 hurt
19:54 because i guess most of academics have
19:57 to deal with
19:58 large data sets at some point
20:01 like in stem right
20:03 like when you have to process by a large
20:05 data sets like even
20:07 for example i know that my
20:09 mother she's uh she's working in ecology
20:12 so she needs to process uh weather data
20:15 for example she's doing that in excel
20:18 sometimes she asks me for help uh
20:21 due to process but yeah i can see like
20:24 how you can reframe this what she's
20:26 doing into
20:28 in such a way that it sounds like um you
20:31 know what data scientists do i think
20:34 it's like
20:35 yeah yeah
20:37 exactly but now i had luck i had help
20:40 how many iterations did it take uh for
20:41 your cv before like so you had this cv
20:44 six pages long cv you had this bottle of
20:46 wine and your friend so you were doing
20:49 this so how how many
20:51 i don't know how many times you needed
20:53 to redo the whole thing before you
20:54 started applying oh the whole thing i
20:56 don't know i i did about 14 iterations
20:59 so i did this with my friend penny and
21:00 then um and then i
21:03 had two different women in industry who
21:06 who just were kind enough to look over
21:07 my cv
21:09 and then i had a few other friends from
21:10 my cohort during my phd my friend roxy
21:13 had already transitioned into industry
21:15 she's now um i'm not gonna i don't want
21:18 to plug her but uh but she's doing
21:20 incredible work and she's gave me really
21:22 good feedback and then i had my friend
21:24 simon um who was also transitioning to
21:26 industry at the same time i did
21:27 uh and so i had you know like like as a
21:30 typical academic right i had i did the
21:32 first iteration and then i sent it out
21:34 to literally everyone um and heard
21:36 got all of the feedback and then
21:38 um
21:39 i talked to a couple friends who were
21:40 recruiters
21:42 and i was just like hey can you take a
21:43 look at this and see
21:45 what's important
21:46 because you write a lot of it
21:48 um you know they're like make sure that
21:49 you have a pdf version making sure that
21:51 the font is something that's machine
21:52 readable
21:54 right
21:55 exactly and like make sure that it's
21:57 machine readable because like a lot of
21:59 people use scanning software to like
22:01 reduce the number of resumes that they
22:03 have to look at and like you know so
22:04 that's why those buzzwords are important
22:06 and
22:08 yeah and i had linkedin premium at the
22:09 time my friend um jessica she was like
22:12 you should pay for linkedin premium and
22:14 so which i almost never like linkedin
22:16 asked me to pay for premium like twice a
22:17 week i'm like no i'm good uh but at the
22:20 time i actually did because it allowed
22:22 me to see the skills that other people
22:24 were listing as like their skills
22:26 and when i just sat down and was like
22:28 what are my skills i was like i don't
22:29 know i can't do anything but then when i
22:31 started looking at what other people
22:33 were listening to their skills i was
22:34 like actually i can do that and i can do
22:35 that and i can do that and so it allowed
22:37 me to like build up this word skill set
22:40 based on
22:41 what other people
22:42 had also done and that i could then
22:44 attribute to myself
22:46 yeah cool thanks for sharing and then
22:48 you said you mentioned the coursera
22:50 specialization and there is a comment in
22:53 live chat people ask for a name that
22:55 specialization
22:56 yes it's old school it was the john
22:59 hawkins data science specialization so
23:01 it was like the one with heart right
23:03 yeah exactly
23:04 uh and it was like i mean this was fall
23:07 of
23:08 2017 uh but i was like it and i still
23:13 i think it didn't teach me a lot of the
23:14 coding things that i needed to know but
23:16 i think it gave me a good broad view
23:18 because it's 10 classes right so it
23:19 gives you a good broad view
23:22 of the field and like
23:24 all the different things that you can
23:25 inspect in data
23:28 do you think uh would you recommend this
23:30 course now
23:32 you recommend would recommend something
23:33 else
23:35 i think it depends on what you want to
23:36 go into
23:38 i think
23:39 because i think that that course um
23:42 i should also mention
23:44 i'm a bit of a masochist and i didn't
23:46 have any money so i looked at it and it
23:47 was like the prices was not per class
23:49 but per month
23:50 and i was like each one was supposed to
23:52 be one month and so it was like a 10
23:54 month class and i was like i can't
23:55 afford that i don't have that kind of
23:56 time and money and so
23:58 i looked at it and i set myself a
24:00 schedule where i did one course a week
24:02 and that way i only had to do it for
24:04 like
24:04 yeah i only had to do it for two months
24:06 there's also a four day weekend in there
24:08 because it was fall break and so i did i
24:10 managed to get all of them done in like
24:12 two months since i didn't have to pay
24:13 for that much
24:14 but i was i was really focused with the
24:17 time and really ambitious but i think
24:19 it was it's good for where i am
24:21 now because now i'm leading both data
24:23 scientists and data analysts and data
24:24 engineers but at the time
24:27 and at the time it was really good
24:28 because it kind of gave me this broad
24:30 view but if it was somebody today i
24:32 think a lot of the field has become a
24:34 lot more specialized and so i'd ask
24:36 somebody like what are you interested in
24:39 right because i think
24:40 i think everybody should take andrew
24:42 ng's machine learning course i think he
24:43 does just a
24:45 fantastic um job of explaining things
24:48 the one we looked at right the the one
24:51 yeah
24:52 that's 3d that's this is where i started
24:55 uh
24:56 exactly exactly and it's really good
24:59 and i think he does a really good job of
25:00 explaining complex things in a very
25:02 simple way which by the way is one of
25:04 the most important skills that you need
25:05 as a data scientist and i think one of
25:07 the things that i uh i get the the
25:09 strongest skill i have from academia is
25:11 being able to explain complex things in
25:13 a simple way and i think that was
25:15 um that's really good to emulate but i
25:17 also think if you know i know a lot of
25:18 people are really into deep learning i
25:20 think fast ai
25:21 has a really great platform for learning
25:23 deep learning um i think if people are
25:25 more interested in statistics i could
25:27 you know like there's a couple of
25:28 bayesian courses that i think would be
25:30 really good so it depends on what people
25:31 are interested in now um and then i
25:33 would send them in a different
25:35 different specific direction
25:37 okay so you wrote your cv you said you
25:39 had 14 iterations and then you took
25:44 like a marathon of course marathon so
25:46 you finished the specialization instead
25:48 of like 10 months in two months
25:50 right
25:51 and then you decided to to move to
25:53 berlin right so you selected berlin
25:55 because you were in germany right you
25:56 weren't in berlin yet
25:58 so you just selected the closest
26:00 uh tech hub or vibration it was it was
26:03 almost more organic than that
26:05 it's like i was living because i
26:08 when i moved from the us i would i
26:09 didn't even berlin wasn't even on my
26:10 radar places i would ever want to live
26:13 um but living in hala which is like an
26:15 hour and a half south
26:17 at the university i would have to go to
26:19 berlin for to fly out right like hala
26:21 has an airport but it doesn't really fly
26:22 anywhere
26:23 and so like i spent a lot of time in
26:25 berlin and like in that year and a half
26:26 i was living in holla i fell in love
26:28 with berlin and so it wasn't just that
26:31 it was the closest city it was the one
26:32 it was the place that i wanted to live
26:35 then and so
26:36 so then i started yeah i started looking
26:38 for jobs in berlin but i also had
26:41 at that point in my mind a list of
26:43 places
26:44 i wanted to be because
26:46 i really liked the product so
26:48 at that point i was already an n26
26:50 customer and i was like i think this is
26:51 a great product like especially as a
26:53 foreigner like being able to get a card
26:54 that works quickly like you can you do
26:57 like fully mobile that
26:58 you know i can i'm talking you speak
27:01 english to the support right and they
27:03 reply back in english
27:05 exactly which is not that common not
27:08 common at all in germany and so like i
27:11 liked the product and there was a couple
27:13 other companies i was looking at i was
27:14 talking to
27:16 get your guide but i didn't have a
27:17 reference there so i was a little bit
27:18 behind um and then there's a
27:20 data science consulting company who
27:23 gave really good talks in berlin they
27:25 had a whole fantastic seminar series um
27:28 and i interviewed with them uh but just
27:30 the initial interview but yeah so it was
27:32 i was like i love travel get your guide
27:34 seems cool and like get your guys blog
27:36 was amazing and so i was attracted to
27:38 them so i only applied to those three
27:39 companies
27:40 so you did a
27:42 pretty thorough research before ponce it
27:44 wasn't like spray and pray you were like
27:48 very selective
27:49 yeah exactly and it's so funny because
27:51 it's so different from when i when i was
27:52 leaving on 26 i did the the you know the
27:54 numbers game the spring pray
27:56 but when i was applying for my first
27:59 position i was i did all of this like i
28:01 would read up and i'd be like do these
28:02 people look happy does this founder look
28:04 good and i told my friend jessica this
28:06 and she's like cj it's gotta be more
28:08 like tinder like you just gotta keep
28:09 swiping like you can't fall in love with
28:11 the person until like you you know they
28:12 respond and she's like because otherwise
28:15 you're going to get your heart broken by
28:16 somebody who doesn't even know you exist
28:18 and it's like and so that's the advice
28:20 that i give now but that's definitely
28:21 not what i did i was just like
28:23 this product is super cool i want to
28:25 work at the people who build this um and
28:28 then i met the people who were there and
28:29 i was like i really feel like i could
28:30 learn from these people and i was right
28:32 i learned a ton i had amazing colleagues
28:34 so
28:35 i got really lucky yeah you were saying
28:37 you keep saying that you were lucky but
28:39 uh
28:40 if i summarize what you did like you did
28:43 14 iterations of your on the rcv so you
28:46 took this long specialization in two
28:48 months
28:50 and then you also were very selective so
28:52 you selected companies like for example
28:54 if they sent 26 you knew it the company
28:58 already you were a customer you knew the
28:59 product
29:01 and
29:02 yeah maybe it wasn't just luck at the
29:05 end
29:06 it was a lot of luck but yeah um
29:09 it was also a lot of work
29:10 yeah because like at the beginning you
29:12 said you just got lucky like people just
29:15 hired you but there is more to that
29:17 than just than just that okay but now
29:20 your advice would be to
29:22 apply to more companies not to
29:25 select a few but apply let's say i don't
29:27 know take a city and then apply to
29:30 all the open positions or how would you
29:32 approach now um no i think i would still
29:34 like i would
29:36 i would have increased my numbers right
29:37 like i would have um so like after i was
29:40 leaving on 26
29:42 so one of my best friends is that still
29:44 the head of data analytics at on 26 and
29:47 he knew i was applying when i was
29:48 leaving uh
29:50 and i got my first rejection i was like
29:52 oh i got rejected and he's like you're
29:54 gonna have to get over that
29:56 you're gonna be getting a lot of those
29:58 but at that point like i you know i've
29:59 been so selective the first round that i
30:01 wasn't familiar with this feeling but
30:03 i think still i'm you know
30:06 i of my little sisters always says that
30:08 she's like find what you love and do it
30:10 in the evenings and weekends and i'm
30:11 never gonna be that person i was like i
30:13 love what i do and i'm passionate about
30:16 it and so
30:17 i'm looking for a space where i can be
30:19 passionate and like i can be invested in
30:21 what i'm doing sometimes too invested
30:23 but um
30:25 but so even then i would go through job
30:27 ads and be like
30:29 you know does this look like a cool
30:30 product like do these look like you know
30:33 does this look like a place i could
30:34 really pursue and really be invested in
30:36 but
30:37 you know in the second iteration when i
30:39 was i applied to like 20 positions and
30:41 you know
30:43 i like
30:44 went through the interview process i got
30:46 a lot of rejections but um
30:48 but yeah it was it was a much more i
30:51 applied to many more places because i
30:52 think
30:54 i mean yeah i think it's i think the
30:56 market's a lot more competitive now
30:58 than it was four years ago
31:00 yeah and then the second job you had was
31:02 also in berlin it was karna right it was
31:05 yeah i was at i mean moved from one
31:06 fintech to another yeah okay so was it
31:09 difficult for you to make the
31:11 the move
31:14 uh i hate onboarding
31:18 uh and i i think
31:20 so was it difficult to make the move it
31:21 was easy to make the decision karna was
31:23 again
31:24 you know when i the clarendon interview
31:26 process is a lot longer uh and so i had
31:28 four interviews back to back
31:30 and i walked out of each of the rooms
31:32 with the interview and i was like i was
31:34 not the smartest person in that room and
31:37 that's a great position to be in when
31:38 you start somewhere new right like i if
31:41 you can start in a position where like
31:42 other people are teaching you things
31:44 then like your growth potential is huge
31:46 and so i was like this is a company i
31:48 want to go to because it was like
31:49 at the time there was 36 data scientists
31:52 uh and like data science is really in
31:54 machine learning is really embedded in
31:56 the product
31:57 and so it's like this is a place where i
31:58 can really
31:59 learn a lot um and learn from really
32:01 cool people
32:03 but the first two weeks the same as
32:05 everywhere right like even in my current
32:06 position the first two weeks you go from
32:08 a place where like you know a lot and
32:10 like you are comfortable in your space
32:11 because you know the product you know
32:13 the company you know who to ask if you
32:15 have crop problems
32:16 all right
32:17 to a space where you know nothing right
32:20 and you have to relearn all of those
32:22 things and you have to relearn those
32:23 connections you have to
32:25 you know you don't even know where to go
32:26 to get the information
32:28 and so like the first two weeks at
32:30 klarna it was like very much i was just
32:32 like ugh
32:34 all of my friends were at n26 like i
32:36 knew everything there i was very
32:38 comfortable why did i put myself in this
32:39 position where i'm once again
32:41 uncomfortable
32:42 um so i hate on boarding but uh but
32:45 after you get up to speed i really
32:46 enjoyed really enjoyed my work there and
32:48 this is how you move to sweden right
32:50 through klarna yeah
32:51 okay because they had a different
32:53 position in
32:55 sweden and this is how you moved
32:57 uh
32:59 no
33:00 there's no way for me to say this
33:01 without sounding arrogant okay i was
33:04 working on a yeah
33:06 uh i was looking i told my manager i was
33:08 like you know and she and i are still
33:09 really good friends i told her i was
33:11 like i really want to try out stockholm
33:12 i was like i've been in berlin for a
33:13 while i want to try stockholm and uh
33:15 she's like okay and so i started looking
33:17 for a new position in stockholm and
33:18 about two weeks into looking for a new
33:20 position in stockholm she's like i can't
33:22 afford to lose you i'm just going to
33:23 move you to stockholm you can work
33:25 remotely and i was like cool
33:27 so yeah so it wasn't for a position
33:31 because there is also an office there is
33:33 there not
33:34 yeah so there's a there's a the main
33:36 office for klarna is in stockholm and so
33:38 um
33:39 so it wasn't for a different position
33:41 within klarna it was for the same
33:43 position on the same team but she was
33:46 willing to move me because i wanted to
33:47 go yeah that's nice
33:49 yeah okay
33:50 um yeah let's say somebody right now he
33:54 lives in a small town in germany
33:57 works as a postdoc at some university
34:00 doing some science
34:02 and then
34:04 they hear the data science is cool
34:07 so they think okay maybe i want to do
34:09 that
34:10 so for that person
34:12 um yeah and they of course want to move
34:14 to berlin or you know some other city so
34:17 for that person what should they do like
34:20 how should they approach uh
34:22 from there there are now to you know a
34:25 company startup in berlin yeah
34:29 that's a very good question um
34:32 i think the biggest thing you can do is
34:34 to do things like
34:36 to try to start engaging with the data
34:38 science community in berlin right i
34:41 think it's one of the great things about
34:42 berlin and stockholm but very much in
34:44 berlin is that it's such a thriving data
34:46 science community and people across
34:48 different companies are super stoked
34:50 to like talk and work with each other
34:52 right so the first step for me
34:54 first piece of advice now would be you
34:57 know
34:58 go to virtual meetups go to them in
34:59 person if you can manage to be in berlin
35:02 um
35:03 you know like start meeting people start
35:04 talking to people about their work and
35:07 like in my experience like most of the
35:09 people because it's such a great data
35:11 science community are like super stoked
35:12 to help right they're like
35:14 you know
35:15 hey i've heard and also everybody's
35:17 hiring right like hey
35:19 you know i i heard you are interested in
35:21 this like maybe you should apply to this
35:22 one or like you know hey i'm looking for
35:24 people like you you know maybe we should
35:26 talk more but like i think
35:28 getting into that community
35:30 would be
35:31 the first step if somebody was working
35:33 as a postdoc and needing to get in there
35:36 um
35:37 i'm remark i've always said i'm
35:38 remarkably bad at networking because i
35:40 have friends who are like gotta work the
35:42 angles you gotta meet the people so they
35:44 can figure out how they could do the
35:45 things and i was just like i'm not that
35:46 i'm just like i want everyone to be my
35:48 friend
35:50 so i tend to to talk to a lot of people
35:52 and i have a lot of people in the data
35:52 science community but it's never like
35:55 you know
35:56 make sure that everybody's good it's
35:57 just like hi you want to get a beer my
35:59 name's cj
36:01 but i think that can take you uh take
36:04 you a really long way
36:06 okay then
36:07 what else
36:10 um
36:12 or that's enough
36:14 i think i honestly think that's enough
36:16 um because i think like i said most
36:18 people for
36:19 entry-level data science positions are
36:21 looking for the same thing looking for
36:22 smart people who are willing to learn
36:24 and um
36:25 and so like you know once you start
36:27 interacting with people in the data
36:28 science community and it's
36:30 you know obvious that you're willing to
36:32 learn then i think uh you know
36:34 everybody's hiring and so
36:36 especially right now
36:37 i think that would be a good good way
36:39 and then once you have your foot in the
36:40 door you know the rest is history
36:43 right
36:44 but
36:45 we also mentioned uh like half an hour
36:47 ago when we started that now maybe
36:50 companies don't just do one interview
36:51 and hire people the process is more
36:54 complicated these days so the
36:56 requirements are a bit higher
36:58 um so what do you think
37:00 now are the minimal requirements like to
37:02 start the job what do you need to
37:04 actually know
37:08 excellent question um
37:10 and i can say from the clarina hiring
37:12 pipeline
37:13 you probably have to be better at
37:14 writing code than i was when i started i
37:16 think that's the the most obvious one is
37:18 is that like the technical test is i
37:20 think a lot more a lot more arduous even
37:23 for really junior people
37:25 um i think
37:26 you know learning learning and
37:28 understanding what clean code is and
37:29 what good coding practices are for data
37:31 science
37:32 i think is
37:34 is going to be crucial and how to do
37:35 that you know
37:37 uh
37:39 i didn't learn how to do that until
37:40 after i started but the way that i
37:42 learned how to get better at programming
37:44 and i still do this a friend of mine
37:46 asked a data scientist friend of mine
37:47 asked me this today like how do i get
37:49 better at writing code and i was like
37:51 find somebody who's better than you are
37:52 and just pair program with them every
37:54 week so i have a fantastic colleague
37:56 that i worked at with at both end 26 and
37:58 then they followed me to klerna
38:01 and they are much better at python
38:03 programming than i am they've been doing
38:05 it since they were little
38:06 and so i blocked a time on our schedule
38:08 for like a solid year when we were at
38:10 klarna and for an hour every week we
38:13 called it
38:14 i have all of the meetings in my
38:16 calendar named bizarre things but our
38:17 meeting was called stuff and things and
38:19 we would meet up and do
38:21 we pick one leak code problem and then
38:23 we pair program it for an hour every
38:24 week and so then i could learn
38:27 how he approached things i could learn
38:28 about algorithm make things that i
38:30 didn't know um at that point my first
38:32 advantage was really strict on clean
38:34 code and so um i learned a lot of clean
38:36 coding practices from that but peer
38:37 reviews um
38:39 uh the foreign you know getting good
38:41 part like a good pr
38:43 review process and like learning from
38:45 how other people would do things i think
38:46 all of that's really good but that all
38:48 happens
38:49 for me all that happened after i started
38:51 in industry and so if i was a you know
38:53 if i was in a postdoc the advice i would
38:55 give
38:56 find somebody who's better than than you
38:58 are who you can learn from and like you
39:00 know really
39:02 really go at that but that's also
39:04 something that's really different
39:05 between academia and industry like one
39:07 of my colleagues at klarna
39:08 was brand new uh out of it like out of
39:11 academia and he did a math phd and he
39:14 and i had a long conversation about how
39:15 he needs to get better at collaborating
39:17 because in academia when you collaborate
39:19 it's like we're going to do this project
39:20 together i'm going to go in this room
39:22 and do this part of the project by
39:23 myself you're going to go into that room
39:25 and you're going to do that part of the
39:25 project by yourself and then we're gonna
39:27 smush it together at the end
39:28 and i was like in industry when we say
39:30 collaborate i mean we're gonna sit next
39:31 to each other there's gonna be one
39:32 keyboard and we're gonna you're gonna
39:33 have to feel comfortable looking stupid
39:37 and it's like you have to feel
39:38 comfortable admitting that you don't
39:39 know everything and i think that's a big
39:42 barrier to get over but once you get
39:43 over that you learn so much so that
39:46 would be my big thing
39:47 yeah thanks so your suggestion would be
39:49 to look around you and find people who
39:52 are better at coding than you
39:55 and pair with them and then perhaps
39:58 offer something in return
39:59 yeah exactly cookies are a great offer
40:01 yeah
40:02 and it goes back to the first step which
40:04 is not working right yeah exactly
40:07 and
40:08 would would that be enough so networking
40:11 and then
40:12 code
40:14 there is a comment about uh
40:16 publication in top data science journals
40:18 as first authors do you think that would
40:20 be
40:21 an important thing to do
40:25 there's one um there's one team in
40:27 florida that does research exclusively
40:29 um and they do really awesome research
40:30 and they're a super fun group of guys um
40:33 i have an ongoing debate with one of
40:35 them about the utility of bayesian
40:36 statistics but uh like they're super
40:38 great but i think most people
40:41 in industry don't have a background in
40:42 academia and so they don't care the
40:45 publications that you've done right
40:47 um
40:48 i always look up people's papers if i
40:49 see that they've published on linkedin
40:51 before i interview with them i'll like
40:53 get a background so i understand
40:54 but unless you're applying for a
40:56 research position in an industry like
40:59 that's not
41:01 that's not a that's not a skill that's
41:02 that's valued i don't think
41:05 what do you think about a project
41:07 portfolio and pet projects do you think
41:09 it's important to get a job in data
41:10 science
41:12 uh
41:13 for me it's not
41:16 but i think
41:19 for when i'm looking for people it's not
41:20 but i think with other people it might
41:22 be so i think if the the person you're
41:24 interviewing with
41:25 has a background in engineering
41:28 and then i think it makes a difference
41:29 because they like to be able to see what
41:31 you've done
41:32 if i see that my first thought is like i
41:33 like that you've printed the effort but
41:35 that so far is so far away from real
41:38 world data
41:39 that like
41:40 it's not gonna be particularly
41:42 you're not gonna be able to use a lot of
41:44 those techniques
41:45 in real world production right and so
41:48 um i had a junior data scientist i
41:50 worked with at klarna and she was brand
41:52 new stars just started came out of her
41:53 masters
41:54 she was like
41:56 i even gave her i didn't even had her do
41:57 the training date i was like here's a
41:59 giant training data set
42:01 and she was like i had no idea how much
42:02 of this was going to be cleaning the
42:04 data like the data sets always come nice
42:06 and clean when we do them in school and
42:07 i was like yeah no
42:09 that's not what it looks like
42:11 i'm terribly sorry
42:13 um so that's why i think i put less
42:15 value a lot of pet projects in my
42:17 experience for data science tend to pull
42:19 from
42:20 you know the really easy to find and the
42:21 really clean data sets and those aren't
42:23 always
42:24 very important because
42:25 the projects you did
42:27 in academia they weren't clean you had
42:30 to oh no
42:31 so that could be a good portfolio
42:34 project right to say okay i had this
42:36 massive amount of data
42:38 of like genomic data
42:40 like from you mentioned like three four
42:42 gigabytes and then you needed to do some
42:44 bash stuff to
42:46 uh to digest that
42:48 yeah yeah
42:49 yeah and i think but and i think a lot
42:51 of that so even now when i have a
42:52 massive data set and i'm trying to
42:54 figure out like how i need to parse it
42:55 i'll usually turn to bash first but um
42:58 but i think that's harder to translate
43:00 right because if i tell somebody like oh
43:01 yeah you built you know
43:03 some de novo transcriptomes on like long
43:06 and short sequencing reads like that
43:08 means something to somebody in biology
43:10 and if i'm going for a biotech job
43:12 yeah it's super important put it in
43:13 there but i wasn't going for a biotech
43:15 job i was going for a fintech job and
43:16 like those words don't mean anybody
43:18 anything to the people i'm applying to
43:20 so i guess maybe
43:22 uh and people always tell us they should
43:23 tailor your cv to the job you're
43:26 applying for and i tend to tailor my
43:28 speaking style to who i'm applying for
43:30 like don't use jargon with
43:32 you know if if i think the person isn't
43:34 going to stand the jargon i'm not going
43:35 to use it um and i think that
43:38 that's worked for me in the past but it
43:39 depends on
43:41 what you're doing and what you're
43:42 looking at what not
43:44 yeah thanks
43:45 um yeah and then we have a question
43:48 about uh like when you transitioned from
43:51 uh academia to industry and did you have
43:54 to adjust your way of communicating and
43:56 interacting with colleagues oh yeah
43:59 oh yeah was it difficult for you
44:04 i really hope that nobody who was at n26
44:06 when i first started is in this
44:08 conversation because uh it was
44:10 incredibly difficult
44:11 and they will tell you
44:13 all of the mistakes that i made um but i
44:16 like their their mistakes they were easy
44:18 to learn from so one of them was i i say
44:20 this to people now especially if they're
44:22 giving talks it's like nobody likes
44:23 feeling stupid but it was really hard
44:25 for me to just this is so arrogant it
44:27 was hard to me to adjust the idea of
44:30 knowledge that i thought everybody knew
44:32 right and so i use the example i was
44:34 talking to a program manager no project
44:36 manager
44:37 um and we were talking about this a b
44:39 test he had done and he really wanted to
44:40 understand like whether or not it was
44:42 significant and so i ran the statistical
44:43 analysis form
44:44 and then i was talking about p values
44:46 and like and he's just like okay cj i
44:48 need to stop i have no idea what a
44:49 p-value is and i was like
44:52 oh
44:53 okay
44:54 it's like let's take a step back
44:56 you know but
44:57 um so things like that but also
45:00 um
45:03 everything like i like the whole idea of
45:05 slack i cannot tell you like again i
45:07 started and i was a brand new industry
45:10 you know brand new job brand new city
45:12 like complete here change i was scared
45:14 to post like emoji responses on slack to
45:16 what other people were saying for the
45:17 first week i was just like i was like oh
45:19 my god what if it's the inappropriate
45:21 thing what if i'm doing this wrong and
45:22 so like that was a whole
45:24 means of communication that i had to
45:26 learn better like you know how to
45:28 there was so much
45:29 um but a lot of it was a lot of it was
45:32 cultural and i think the biggest thing
45:34 for me is this realization
45:38 that in academia
45:39 everybody has a similar experience right
45:42 like if you get to be a postdoc then you
45:44 know that like every single person who's
45:46 done a phd there might be some edge
45:48 cases but everybody knows what it's
45:50 looked like to have like okay i have two
45:51 dollars in my hand and that's all the
45:53 money i have to feed myself for the next
45:55 two weeks right like you have this
45:57 shared experience and like okay i've
45:59 defended my dissertation it was
46:01 incredibly difficult i cried in the
46:03 hallway you know but or like everybody
46:05 has these shared experiences and so like
46:07 as you move forward in your careers in
46:08 academia you have these shared
46:10 experiences that you can bond over and
46:12 that doesn't exist in industry right
46:14 like i was i remember
46:16 we were in the bank and we're talking
46:17 about uh doing an overdraft experiment
46:19 and they're like oh we'll just if shoot
46:21 a couple of people 250 euros and oh for
46:24 draft and the bank was like the people
46:26 who might be like who's ever going to
46:27 use 250 and overdraft that's no money at
46:30 all and i just looked at them i was like
46:31 oh you've never been poor
46:33 but like we didn't have these you know
46:35 these things that were shared that like
46:37 you can rely on in terms of the culture
46:39 and academia and so i had to shift the
46:41 way i was communicating with colleagues
46:43 uh
46:43 not just like the tools and not just
46:45 like the you know idea that i assumed
46:48 everybody knew this but also like the
46:50 the shared experience that no longer
46:52 existed
46:56 somebody's writing it's like that they
46:57 have to they're going through the exact
46:59 same thing
47:00 yes with slack right now it's terrifying
47:04 it was so terrifying
47:06 yeah and like all of my my colleagues
47:08 there at the time will tell you like you
47:09 know i just walked around with this like
47:12 terrified look on my face for the first
47:13 two weeks and i don't have a poker face
47:15 and so everybody knew
47:18 but yeah
47:19 but also i think in academia at least in
47:22 the places where i was a student
47:24 you know or where i visited
47:26 it's always rooms so you have rooms
47:28 where people sit so it's not open spaces
47:30 so it's a room with two or three people
47:32 but it's rooms and then when you go to
47:34 industry it's usually like a floor
47:37 without walls and people sit together
47:40 that was it also difficult for you to
47:43 to get used to
47:45 surprisingly no
47:47 um but i think
47:49 i i think i
47:50 i think that's just a me thing i could
47:52 see how that would be a problem for
47:53 other people
47:55 but i when i when i get in the zone and
47:56 i'm really focused the same thing's true
47:58 like when i'm reading a book like there
47:59 could be bombs exploding around me i
48:01 have no idea like i when i get focused
48:02 it doesn't matter what's happening
48:04 around me and i liked the social aspect
48:06 of it a lot um so like i said
48:09 one of my best friends is still the head
48:11 of data analytics at n26 but he and i at
48:14 the time the data team was only 10
48:15 people so the data science and data
48:17 analytics sat right next to each other
48:18 and so our chairs were right next to
48:20 each other and day two we were
48:22 immediately best friends and so like he
48:25 made me laugh so i have a really loud
48:26 laugh but he made me laugh so much that
48:28 as the data team grew and like the data
48:31 science ended up in a different space
48:33 and we weren't sitting next to each
48:34 other anymore like half of the office
48:36 commented they're like now that robin
48:37 and cj aren't sitting together
48:38 everything is a lot quieter around here
48:40 like he wasn't making me laugh as much
48:42 and so like the whole area quieted down
48:45 and so i could see how it would affect
48:46 other people but uh the open space
48:48 wasn't wasn't everything for me
48:50 okay yeah
48:51 um
48:53 i'm also curious
48:54 like from the skills you had
48:56 before like in academia we talked about
48:59 uh
49:00 that many of them they they were
49:02 actually useful like you know being able
49:04 to process to clean data to process
49:06 these large amounts of data like all the
49:09 statistical things but what about things
49:11 that weren't useful that were maybe even
49:14 harmful
49:15 were there things like that or not
49:18 yeah
49:19 um
49:20 oh i was asked this the other day and i
49:22 forgot what my answer was
49:24 um
49:26 the things that weren't useful
49:29 the competitiveness so i think
49:32 like i said in industry
49:34 people tend to collaborate more and so
49:36 like hiding
49:39 hiding what you don't know and like
49:40 trying to be like trying to compete with
49:42 your colleagues i think is really not
49:43 useful in industry and i think it can
49:45 get really harmful um but that's
49:47 something that's innate into academia
49:49 because everybody is like cut throat to
49:50 beat each other
49:51 um and i think that was actively and
49:54 then
49:55 yeah and i think it
49:56 i again i was really lucky that my team
49:58 was really collaborative at n26 but
50:01 even then it took me a couple of weeks
50:02 to feel really comfortable looking
50:04 stupid in front of other people and i
50:06 was like and in academia like everybody
50:09 everybody's really smart but um but also
50:12 you're spending a lot of time
50:14 trying to be smarter and so like you
50:17 you don't show as many vulnerabilities
50:19 and so it took me
50:20 a couple of weeks to really feel
50:21 comfortable
50:23 like being
50:24 like i don't know this and like can you
50:26 help me figure it out
50:28 uh and i think that was
50:30 like potentially can be really harmful
50:32 and i think the same thing was true of
50:34 um
50:35 again this colleague at uh klarna who
50:38 had just come from a math phd and it
50:40 took him it took him about two months to
50:42 like admit that he didn't know something
50:43 and he he really struggled with that and
50:45 it was the same
50:46 the same problem where i was like you
50:48 know this is not this is not how we were
50:50 taught to behave but this is how you
50:51 need to behave in order to be successful
50:54 in this new environment
50:56 is there any way to
50:57 like you just need to do this right you
50:59 just need to
51:01 be in that environment and learn and try
51:03 to
51:04 to adjust right yeah so the way that i'm
51:06 doing it now because i've got i'm facing
51:08 a similar problem
51:09 uh at my current position where i'm like
51:11 leading people and trying to get them to
51:13 feel comfortable talking to each other
51:15 um and feel comfortable being stupid in
51:17 front of each other and the way that it
51:18 worked at n26 for me
51:20 is
51:21 we had this russian back like data
51:23 engineer who still rules with an iron
51:25 fist he's fantastic
51:27 and
51:28 he read the like the fine print and
51:32 found out that you could do once a month
51:34 a team dinner and so there's a budget
51:37 for it but once a month you take the
51:38 team out to dinner and the data team was
51:40 the only team at n26 who did this this
51:42 often but once a month we all went out
51:43 to dinner and just hung out with each
51:45 other
51:46 and so i think a lot of it is like being
51:48 able to break down the barriers of like
51:49 establishing that these people are your
51:50 friends and they're not judging you
51:53 and then the dumb questions can come and
51:55 then you can feel comfortable asking
51:56 that but i'm doing the same thing right
51:57 now where there's a lot of knowledge
51:59 silos at my current company and i was
52:01 like we're all gonna go hang out and eat
52:02 dinner we're gonna go hang out drinking
52:04 like i'm throwing you guys an event to
52:05 do this just so that i can
52:07 get people to feel more comfortable
52:09 looking stupid and i talk about how i
52:11 fail you know like i try to get people
52:13 to feel comfortable enough looking dumb
52:15 in front of each other that they are
52:16 willing to ask each other questions even
52:18 if they think in their mind like this is
52:19 a dumb question like if you don't ask
52:21 you won't know the answer
52:23 okay yeah thanks so basically people
52:26 just need to get
52:27 to be comfortable with each other to get
52:29 used to each other and it just takes a
52:32 bit of time so you don't feel
52:34 comfortable immediately you just need to
52:36 give yourself a bit of time and then
52:38 things become easier i hope so that's
52:41 been my experience and it seems to be uh
52:43 slowly working in my current company so
52:46 okay
52:47 yeah thanks
52:48 now this is an interesting question from
52:50 matias
52:52 is have you had time to research explore
52:54 a topic that might may not have an
52:57 immediate impact on your job but let to
53:00 meet our long-term value
53:03 um
53:05 like actual data science topics
53:07 i
53:08 i think so
53:10 yeah
53:11 um yeah but i used that time um
53:15 yes natural language processing is like
53:17 one of my favorite things i
53:19 employed it in like within
53:21 other data
53:23 but i haven't done any full
53:25 not many full natural language
53:26 processing assignments but i still
53:29 you know again at n26 and then at klarna
53:31 as well
53:32 i use that time in the morning to like
53:34 study and learn new things and to try
53:36 you know new kaggle competitions and and
53:38 learn new techniques um and so although
53:41 i've never
53:42 deployed a full nlp model um
53:46 i know that those things are useful and
53:48 now i can help like because i'm no you
53:50 know i'm now leading people so i'm not
53:52 doing as much individual contributor but
53:54 we have a couple of assignments that
53:56 look to be nlp assignments and so i know
53:57 i can now help my other keep my people
54:00 learn the skills that they need to so
54:01 that they can succeed in this assignment
54:03 even though like i haven't actually used
54:05 it myself yet
54:06 yeah that's quite an interesting
54:08 perspective so even though it wasn't
54:11 immediately useful back then
54:13 you know used to help your
54:15 uh your colleagues yeah that's cool what
54:17 about kaggle was it helpful for you
54:20 uh no because i don't actually compete i
54:23 just i use it as a source of like cool
54:26 uh data sets and neat ideas
54:29 and then i can play around with those
54:31 data sets and ideas and like try it out
54:33 and i also really like i'll try it out
54:34 myself first and try to solve it but you
54:37 know i was in the hiring pipeline at
54:38 klarna and obviously i'm hiring now
54:40 and it's really interesting
54:42 to see
54:43 not how just how i answer the question
54:45 but how other people do and that gives
54:47 me
54:48 like it's a much deeper experience
54:49 because then you're like i didn't think
54:50 about it from that angle but now that
54:52 i've thought about it from your angle
54:53 i've now incorporated that into my own
54:56 mentality of like ways i could approach
54:58 this problem in the future
54:59 so yeah okay so kaggle was useful but
55:02 not as a
55:04 uh yeah
55:07 it's really useful to learn how other
55:09 people are doing that
55:10 there is an insane amount of uh
55:13 knowledge there
55:14 there's just so much stuff there like in
55:17 each competition
55:18 like there is forums and then forums
55:20 there are discussions and there is an
55:23 insane amount of uh information there
55:26 yeah for sure
55:28 um i know that you brought the textbook
55:32 what was the textbook about
55:34 oh this is such a funny story when i saw
55:36 you put this down in the list of
55:37 questions i was like yes i wrote a
55:39 textbook but it's really funny and it
55:40 wouldn't have happened if i didn't have
55:41 another really good collaborator
55:44 so i was teaching this um
55:46 course in my during my phd it was um
55:50 parasitology was the course
55:52 and
55:53 parasitology so it's parasite
55:55 parasites okay yeah
55:58 um my phd is in host parasite
55:59 convolution so it was natural that i
56:01 would be teaching ferrous astrology
56:03 uh
56:04 but the teacher the professor retired
56:06 like basically halfway through the
56:07 semester and so
56:09 we were sort of left in this position
56:11 where
56:12 i had to write the course
56:14 and if you've ever read a course from
56:16 scratch it's incredibly difficult and it
56:18 takes a ton of time
56:20 and it probably put me back about
56:21 semester graduating
56:23 but
56:24 you know i had this colleague
56:26 and i was i had the knowledge i was like
56:28 i know a lot about parasites i've been
56:29 studying this for the last you know 10
56:31 years
56:32 i know about a lot about ecology i know
56:34 a lot about the evolution of them and so
56:36 i would and i had some ideas for what we
56:38 could do for the actual class and so i
56:41 would write and then she would edit it
56:43 in such a way that i made it friendlier
56:44 to the students right but we put
56:46 together this whole class on like the
56:48 shoestring budget we like you know got
56:50 you know we're driving the whole thing
56:52 wrote the tests like you know set up the
56:54 website did the whole thing
56:56 and at the end of the semester
56:57 she approached the because i was a
56:59 graduate student i was like everything i
57:00 do is worthless but she has a much
57:02 better sense of self-worth and so she
57:04 approached the department and she was
57:06 just like hey we wrote this course do
57:07 you guys want it
57:08 and they're like no we're not buying
57:10 anything from you you guys are free
57:11 labor and she was like cool [ __ ] you and
57:13 then went to a
57:15 textbook company i think hayden i looked
57:18 this up the other day hayden millen or
57:20 something like that uh i forget the
57:22 exact textbook company but she
57:23 approached them and she's like hey we
57:24 wrote this course and we can turn it
57:26 into a textbook if you guys are
57:27 interested and they're like
57:29 yeah that sounds great and so next thing
57:31 i know
57:31 kim and i it was kim was my colleague
57:33 she's incredible uh it's kim and i are
57:35 on this phone call talking about cover
57:37 art for our textbook
57:39 it's just like i don't know how i got
57:40 here
57:42 but this is great so yeah we co-authored
57:44 this textbook together and then
57:46 they they set our deadline and i
57:48 remember the like four days before the
57:49 deadline we had to take all of the stuff
57:51 that we'd written and put it into
57:53 chapters that made sense
57:54 and we had a schedule we just sat on her
57:56 couch her husband took care of us we
57:58 just sat on her couch for four days like
58:00 rotating between like pairs of yoga
58:02 pants every 12 hours while he like fed
58:03 us and did laundry and we just wrote
58:07 for like four days but yeah it's the
58:08 evolution and ecology of parasitology
58:11 yeah so was there what was on the cover
58:14 at the end a parasite or something oh it
58:15 was this fantastic photo um from one of
58:18 our students of a parasite underneath a
58:19 microscope
58:22 it's pretty cool
58:24 well a slightly unrelated topic but
58:26 there is a comment from aaron that there
58:28 are tools for for team to feel
58:31 comfortable with each other the tools
58:32 are
58:33 liberating
58:34 liberating structures serious games that
58:38 people can practice
58:39 to like for trust learning vulnerability
58:42 and so on
58:45 um do you want to add anything before we
58:47 wrap up
58:48 no i think you know it was i i feel very
58:52 lucky because i've been surrounded you
58:53 asked me before you're like how do you
