1:05 so that's all for the introduction now
1:07 let me stop sharing my screen
1:09 and
1:11 by the way i forgot to do i usually do a
1:14 picture
1:16 make a picture and then share this
1:17 picture on twitter
1:18 so maybe you can
1:20 can you smile and then i'll take a
1:22 picture
1:24 okay oops
1:30 cool
1:31 so i took a picture now i will share it
1:33 on twitter
1:38 are you active on twitter or not so much
1:42 yeah i just started but i've not been
1:44 really active there
1:46 hoping to do more hopefully
1:50 okay
1:51 so
1:52 let's start
1:56 okay so this week we'll talk about
1:57 visualizing machine learning and we have
1:59 a special guest today mellor you
2:01 probably saw me or on linkedin where he
2:03 shares amazing visualization about
2:05 different machine learning concepts
2:08 one of the last ones i remember well
2:10 about
2:11 was about
2:12 drift in machine learning right that was
2:15 a pretty cool one so
2:18 how often do you actually post things i
2:20 see quite regularly there like quickly
2:22 right
2:23 yeah so i used to so i started
2:26 sometime media last year
2:28 so i was doing almost one visual every
2:31 day
2:32 but now because of other commitments i'm
2:34 starting to a little bit less but hoping
2:36 to
2:37 put more uh visuals soon and go back to
2:40 my earlier cadence so hopefully that
2:42 will come soon yeah you also wrote a
2:45 book about neural networks where you use
2:48 this visualization so do check it out so
2:51 yeah welcome to our event
2:53 thank you for having me alexia it's a
2:55 pleasure to be here
2:56 yeah before we go into our main topic of
2:59 visualization visualizing machine
3:01 learning let's start with your
3:02 background can you tell us about your
3:04 career journey so far
3:06 yeah sure so
3:08 um i was introduced to machine learning
3:10 quite some time ago almost 10 years ago
3:12 now
3:13 so back then i was interested in doing
3:15 research in limb prosthetics
3:18 and i decided to
3:19 stop whatever i was doing in my career
3:21 and
3:22 do a master's degree doing research in
3:24 that and that was when i was introduced
3:26 to machine learning which is the
3:28 technology or the algorithm that's
3:29 powering the
3:30 whole industry so i did this master's in
3:33 bioengineering
3:34 with a view of doing
3:36 a phd but i stopped after the masters
3:39 and they didn't continue with a phd
3:41 because
3:42 uh one of the reasons is that back then
3:44 the
3:45 the
3:46 excitement around ai and machine
3:48 learning was totally not like what it is
3:50 today so the research was relatively
3:53 slow there was
3:55 not
3:56 much breakthrough and one of the reasons
3:58 that i didn't really
4:00 see the application in the in the real
4:02 world at the time
4:04 so i decided to go
4:06 back into
4:07 working so i i
4:09 joined a company
4:11 in the telecommunications industry that
4:13 does
4:14 um data platforms
4:17 doing data engineering for
4:19 telecommunications data
4:21 and doing analytics on top of it so i
4:23 did that for
4:24 around six seven years
4:26 but what i've always wanted to do for
4:29 quite some time was in education be in
4:31 an adult or even childhood education
4:34 so in 2019 around two years back i
4:36 decided that i wanted to do something
4:38 else so i went into self-employment mode
4:42 so i became an independent consultant
4:45 initially i was doing
4:48 training consultancy in the area i was
4:51 related to back then which is
4:52 telecommunications analytics
4:55 and slowly i move into
4:58 education in a childhood space which is
5:01 tying back to what i've also the other
5:03 area that i wanted i've always wanted to
5:05 do with jci and machine learning which i
5:08 revived my interest in the past couple
5:10 of years so i did um ai educational
5:13 resources for middle schools and high
5:14 schools
5:16 uh under the name of ed square so it's
5:17 still there
5:19 and
5:20 that was happening
5:21 right until middle of last year when i
5:24 encountered this way of uh
5:27 i mean a fun way of of
5:29 creating educational materials
5:32 for adults which is using visuals so i
5:34 came upon this
5:36 this approach and i just uh without any
5:38 background in design at all so i was
5:40 just trying to
5:42 apply uh visuals into uh explaining the
5:46 concept of machine learning so that's
5:47 when i started to create these visuals
5:50 under the name of k dimensions so it has
5:52 been going on for
5:54 for
5:55 almost yeah nine eight nine months now
5:57 so that's that's where i'm at currently
6:00 so
6:00 while i was doing other things i'm still
6:02 doing the other things that i started uh
6:04 before but slowly my focus is
6:06 is now in uh decay dimensions
6:10 so why this name
6:12 oh so yeah
6:13 so
6:14 when you know it's quite obvious because
6:16 um in borders from the concept of
6:18 machine learning
6:19 dimensionally dimensionality reduction
6:22 so
6:23 for example if you talk about
6:25 a machine learning problem right so you
6:26 have a data that is very big
6:29 let's say a thousand of uh thousands of
6:31 features so what you can do is that you
6:32 can compress it into
6:35 a
6:37 number of features that's much less than
6:39 what it is before while maintaining the
6:41 same amount of information so that's the
6:44 concept behind pca and
6:46 all the different algorithms that that
6:48 falls under dimensionality reduction
6:50 so that's the same idea that i had with
6:52 visual as well and i think that's where
6:54 the power of visuals come in is that
6:56 with just a visual you'll be able to
6:58 compress a lot of information that you
7:00 would otherwise have to write it down
7:02 and a bit harder for people to
7:04 comprehend and for people to digest with
7:06 a visual you
7:08 of course won't retain the same
7:09 information as what you can explain with
7:11 the text but you can
7:14 go straight to the essence and people
7:16 can get it immediately so that's the
7:17 idea so k is uh
7:20 the common
7:21 the common um uh alphabet that people
7:24 use
7:25 uh
7:26 while
7:27 while reducing the dimensions from n
7:29 dimensions to k dimensions
7:31 when people do do pca so so that's where
7:34 the name came well i suspected yeah
7:36 that's uh
7:37 idea like to name it it makes total
7:40 sense you take a complex idea then you
7:44 simplify it and you reduce sort of
7:45 dimensionality of this idea
7:47 right that's cool
7:49 and
7:50 yeah so in 2019 you became
7:53 self-employed and you started being an
7:56 independent consultant right and you
7:57 started also working on these visuals
7:59 was it scary for you to
8:01 um you know go solo
8:04 yeah it was but i
8:05 it was because i've always wanted to do
8:07 it for a long time even after i
8:09 completed my my muscles because i
8:12 from then then on i
8:15 i wanted to do something in new
8:16 education space and throughout
8:19 my career with with the company i was in
8:21 before i was doing some other small
8:22 ventures in education especially
8:24 childhood education but of course with
8:27 the
8:28 question of having a job you you don't
8:31 really put the full commitment because
8:33 somehow you have this something that you
8:35 can fall back on but i thought
8:38 the time was just right for me to do it
8:40 fully so i didn't really have a clear
8:42 plan i do have some idea
8:44 so i just went into it and
8:46 yeah luckily i'm i'm managing well so
8:49 far
8:51 yeah i know that there is a guy called
8:54 check butcher and he has i think he is
9:00 he has a twitter
9:02 profile called visualize value probably
9:04 a website as well
9:05 and i see some similarities in what you
9:07 do and what jack is doing
9:10 did you get the inspiration from him
9:12 with coming up with all these visuals or
9:15 well what kind of sources of
9:17 inspirations did you have when you
9:18 decide okay i want to follow this format
9:21 and i want to create visuals in such a
9:24 way that you create right now so how did
9:26 it start for you
9:28 yeah in fact it started with with him
9:30 because i was
9:32 browsing through
9:34 my feed and came upon this
9:36 very
9:37 simple and minimal visual
9:39 but that that gives a big weight in
9:42 terms of the the the if i mean the
9:45 the perspective or the message that he
9:47 wants to bring
9:48 so i've never seen such visuals
9:51 and i started to dig deep into his
9:54 approach and his his way of doing things
9:56 i enrolled in his course called how to
9:59 visualize value
10:00 which explains how he goes through
10:03 this process of making visuals and the
10:05 idea being behind it the philosophy
10:07 behind it i was mind blown because it's
10:10 a concept that
10:11 even though it looks it looks i wouldn't
10:14 say i wouldn't say he's the first one
10:15 who have done it but he has definitely
10:16 is the one that has broad mainstream and
10:18 he's the one that really
10:20 can relate to a lot of people
10:22 um
10:23 i i still haven't figured out the right
10:25 term for
10:27 for this whole category yet but the
10:29 closest i can find is i think visual
10:30 engineering so of course it's not
10:32 engineering in the technical sense but
10:34 it's about using visuals for you to
10:37 convey a message
10:38 that's
10:39 that's
10:40 unlike a normal way for you to that you
10:43 normally do for for you to create
10:45 visuals or i can put it this way
10:48 um
10:49 there is a way of for you to create
10:51 visuals
10:52 that attach
10:53 to a text or a message that you are
10:55 trying to say but there is a way for you
10:57 to create a visual that amplifies or
11:01 make better what you are trying to to
11:04 convey and jack's uh visuals false uh
11:08 false under this letter category
11:10 so i was i was uh amazed so that's when
11:13 uh it all started for me i started to
11:16 try to uh yeah so i thought that might
11:18 as well because i was already doing um
11:22 machine learning educational materials
11:24 back then
11:26 primarily with ad square for childhood
11:28 education but i thought that
11:30 i could apply the same thing so
11:32 simply simplifying machining concepts
11:35 and applying it using visuals
11:37 and of course there are many many
11:38 reasons uh to do it and one of the
11:40 reasons is that i think at the moment
11:42 there's just
11:43 uh
11:45 more information that we need
11:47 when it comes to learning machine
11:48 learning because yeah there are so many
11:50 resources there are courses there are
11:52 books
11:53 there are blog posts
11:55 code examples
11:56 it goes on
11:57 so the question now is not about how you
12:00 um how you create additional material i
12:03 think the question now is how do you
12:05 curate this content
12:07 or maybe more accurately how do you
12:08 condense this content into something
12:10 that is digestible for people and i mean
12:13 it's really
12:14 an interesting industry to be to be in
12:17 right now because a lot of people are
12:18 interested in this subject and area
12:21 people are really
12:23 motivated to learn and i hope to be able
12:25 to to give them a way for them to learn
12:28 at least
12:29 to enter to give an entry
12:32 for them to be able to to get in get get
12:35 into the door for them before they
12:36 explore things in more detail for them
12:38 to be able to grasp the concepts
12:40 in a simple way to get it in terms of at
12:42 the intuition level before they go
12:44 further into
12:46 um into
12:47 into what they are doing but of course
12:49 it's not just jack there are many other
12:51 people i look up to and even in the
12:53 machine learning space there are already
12:55 a lot of
12:56 uh very talented people who are already
12:59 creating visuals that explain consensus
13:01 machine learning so first and foremost
13:02 for me is j
13:04 j alamar who has this blog that explains
13:07 uh concept
13:10 around
13:11 mostly
13:12 um
13:13 neural networks so for example word to
13:16 vag
13:17 transformers who has this famous blog
13:19 post illustrated transformers and has a
13:21 lot of other
13:22 kinds of materials as well so
13:25 yeah so that's a resource that i i go to
13:28 for me to understand these concepts
13:30 myself and i found it really relatable
13:32 for me to
13:33 visually look at the concepts and get
13:35 the intuition before going into the math
13:37 before going to the code
13:39 and there are other i mean the list goes
13:41 on for example stat quest uh josh
13:43 starmer that that really
13:45 simplifies the understanding of machine
13:47 learning and data science using visuals
13:49 by way of video
13:51 uh luis serrano as well so he has this
13:53 book blocking machine learning i'm sure
13:55 you know
13:57 yeah he he also provide creates
13:59 wonderful videos that explains these
14:01 concepts so i think with visuals then
14:03 you pair that with with code and math i
14:06 think
14:07 it will make sense when you go deeper
14:09 into into any subject in this field
14:12 so yeah so you were already
14:14 in education so you were already
14:18 in this education space and then you
14:19 were browsing through your feed and then
14:21 you saw a visual from jack butcher right
14:24 and you thought okay this is so cool i
14:26 want to do something similar and then
14:27 this is how it started right and
14:29 actually when i saw
14:31 also
14:33 images from jack i thought
14:35 it could would be cool if somebody does
14:38 something similar for machine learning
14:40 and then
14:41 a few months after that
14:43 i saw you on linkedin and that was it i
14:46 thought okay like this is uh it's like a
14:48 zip check
14:50 was doing this thing
14:51 cool and i remember i was listening to a
14:54 podcast with him i didn't take a course
14:56 i was listening to a podcast
14:58 and he said that he on purpose
15:01 restricts himself so he restricts
15:03 himself he only
15:06 uses
15:07 i don't know one two colors right he
15:09 only uses simple shapes
15:12 what else is there
15:14 yeah exactly so he there are i mean
15:16 other than visuals
15:18 he also have a lot of very interesting
15:20 perspectives
15:21 about visuals and beyond visuals and one
15:23 one of the things that you mentioned is
15:24 exactly
15:25 one of the things that i took away from
15:26 him is that
15:29 basically you have to introduce
15:30 constraints in in the work that you do i
15:33 think it's true for visuals and i think
15:34 it's true for anything that you do in
15:36 life as well so whenever especially when
15:38 you're creating something um for him is
15:41 intrude yeah exactly like you see so
15:43 these two colors black and white
15:45 geometrical shapes
15:47 uh abstract concepts that's it
15:49 so there are there is this thing that uh
15:52 that created constraints breed
15:53 creativity
15:55 so it's like
15:56 it's it said it is ironical that that uh
16:00 that that is the case because people
16:02 would think that for you to be able to
16:04 be creative you have to have a lot of
16:05 resource with you you have to have for
16:07 example talent you have to have a lot of
16:09 you have to know tools you have to know
16:11 a lot of um
16:12 ideas so that is true but
16:15 looking
16:16 at it from the other the other
16:17 perspective is that when you introduce
16:19 constraints you are forced to work with
16:21 only what you have so that's when you
16:23 get focused and you're not really
16:25 worried about the other things that you
16:26 can do the other things that that is
16:28 also
16:30 beneficial to you for you to create
16:31 something you don't you don't worry
16:33 about it you just work on what you have
16:35 and yeah like what you see with the
16:37 visual that jack this
16:39 you can do amazing things uh with with
16:41 the constraint that you impose on
16:43 yourself
16:44 okay i think for you you use only three
16:46 colors right so the background is always
16:50 so yeah so for me because
16:53 for me it's about explaining a technical
16:55 concept and you you're talking about
16:58 sometimes concepts that are very
17:01 deep in terms of the things that you
17:02 want to explain there are a lot more
17:04 there so i tried to use as
17:06 like two two colors it didn't work so
17:08 yeah so i used three colors so the
17:10 background is dark and
17:11 just three main colors uh so red white
17:13 and uh blue
17:16 so so yeah i found that that is the
17:18 right equilibrium for me to to to work
17:20 on
17:21 even though there are times when i think
17:23 i still need to have some other shapes
17:25 but i try to keep myself to do that and
17:27 yeah
17:29 it has really
17:30 served me well so far
17:33 how do you come up with these ideas
17:36 like to where do you see them
17:39 so
17:41 so i think there are
17:43 i think there are many ways to do it so
17:44 my approach that i found to be working
17:47 well is
17:48 first to introduce the constraint and
17:50 the constraint can be
17:52 can be
17:53 coming from different there are
17:55 different types so one is the style
17:57 constraint that we have just
17:58 discussed about the other thing is that
18:01 for you to introduce constraints in
18:03 terms of the time so maybe you set the
18:04 time
18:06 okay before that you have to introduce
18:07 questions of the topic so let's say
18:09 there's a topic that you want to
18:10 visualize even though you are not sure
18:12 how you're going to make it
18:14 you don't go into the next topic let's
18:16 say brief like what you mentioned just
18:17 now so i will stick with just brief i
18:19 i'll make sure that i will be able to
18:21 create some kind of visual related to
18:23 drift before going on to other topics
18:25 and once you have the topic you
18:26 introduce a time constraint which is
18:28 within just like a few minutes for
18:30 example you just put it down on paper
18:31 whatever you have in your mind and
18:33 that's i think when the magic happens
18:35 because the moment you have something
18:37 written or sketch that's when you can
18:39 improve it on it because you cannot
18:41 improve on things that is blank but you
18:43 can definitely improve on things that
18:45 are that are already there no matter how
18:47 how ugly it looks and no matter how how
18:50 different it looks from what you you
18:52 would imagine in in in the end
18:55 the other thing that um
18:57 you
18:58 can do is for you to
19:00 um
19:02 so yeah so the other thing so so so
19:04 confidence is one thing the other thing
19:05 that i found it
19:07 uh to be
19:08 to be working for me is for uh
19:11 to try to visualize
19:13 how do i say this to try to visualize um
19:18 things
19:19 not
19:20 what it is but what it means
19:23 so so let me try to rephrase that so
19:26 when you try to visualize a concept
19:29 um
19:30 what i learned from jack is that from
19:32 his visual is that
19:34 you don't try to visualize the noun
19:36 which is what it is
19:38 but visualize or try to extract what is
19:41 the verb or the adjective
19:44 so that's when you
19:46 are able to accept the message that you
19:48 want to to
19:49 to to
19:50 to deliver again using this brief
19:52 example
19:54 uh so i was using this this visual of um
19:57 a catapult throwing throwing this ball
19:59 into into basket right
20:00 so so the idea that i had at the time is
20:03 that it's about accuracy so it's not
20:05 about model because if you are thinking
20:07 about models you're talking about
20:08 algorithms then you're stuck with maybe
20:10 boxes and squares rectangles and arrows
20:13 so that's that's that's one way of doing
20:15 things but i think that is looking from
20:18 the logical uh point of view which is
20:21 what it is the noun of what you're
20:22 trying to
20:23 represent but if you try to understand
20:25 what he's trying to do which is trying
20:26 to
20:27 uh
20:29 to be accurate then
20:31 then that's when you start to think
20:32 about what kind of metaphors what kind
20:33 of
20:34 objects that you can also use to
20:36 represent
20:38 and that brings another another
20:40 benefit which is
20:42 um
20:44 using metaphors using objects
20:46 that people can relate with makes it
20:48 very very less intimidating for people
20:50 to understand a concept because the
20:52 moment for example you start to use
20:53 rectangles and arrows
20:55 people can get the idea but not quite
20:57 they they feel like they are not
21:00 yet attached to the idea but the moment
21:02 you uh you start to show everyday
21:04 objects everyday things ah at least they
21:06 get the object and then
21:08 that becomes the bridge for them to
21:10 understand the real concept that you
21:11 want to
21:12 you want to represent
21:14 so metaphors and abstract concepts uh
21:17 yeah probably are the the two
21:20 uh things that you may want to look into
21:22 if you are trying to visualize things
21:24 okay so
21:26 first you think okay i want to create
21:28 something on let's say drift and then
21:30 you give yourself a bit of time i know
21:32 to use a timer maybe
21:34 set it to 5-10 minutes something like
21:36 this right and then you start
21:38 brainstorming
21:39 how exactly what kind of how can i show
21:41 the action what is the action there what
21:43 is the verb in this uh in this direct
21:46 because it is a noun as you said right
21:48 but what is an action and the action is
21:51 i think the
21:52 catapult he used it's missing right it's
21:55 not
21:56 it cannot hit
21:58 the what was there like a baseball yeah
22:02 yeah so for the original model is just a
22:05 basket
22:06 uh with data drift your you are i mean
22:09 you're looking at the catapult not
22:10 really functioning well or the ball have
22:12 changed its shape for example which
22:14 caused the catapult not really hitting
22:16 the target so that's about the data
22:18 itself the source
22:19 uh whereas concept grief is about the
22:22 target itself that you are changing so
22:24 from a basket you are changing it to a
22:26 to a basketball game for example which
22:27 is a higher
22:29 in this case a higher higher target so
22:32 you need to adapt
22:33 your source to to match to match
22:36 the target that you have just changed
22:38 so i can give another example um
22:41 that i found i think really
22:43 uh uh interesting as well to me is that
22:46 because i was trying to to to understand
22:48 and internalize the concept of this data
22:50 center ai
22:52 which is also uh being popularized these
22:55 days
22:56 uh so when people talk about data center
22:58 ai
22:59 it does not mean that
23:00 we are
23:03 being
23:04 relaxed on the model development itself
23:06 what are saying here is that we have
23:08 focused
23:09 so much on the model development fine
23:12 tuning and all that but not so much
23:14 focusing on the data so the moment we
23:16 talk about data central ai by the time
23:18 maybe people can think will think that
23:21 it is about um
23:24 primarily about the data but not so much
23:26 of the model the model is there as it is
23:27 but the fact is that you need to have
23:29 both you need to have balance so that's
23:31 when i thought about the the adjective
23:33 that that represents the ideas about
23:35 balance so that's when i i
23:38 figured out this idea to draw the
23:40 concept of aeroplane
23:41 uh whereby one side of the wing is
23:44 of a modern aircraft and the other side
23:46 is less developed which is like the
23:48 wings from the 50s for example
23:50 so the idea is that for the aircraft to
23:53 function well you need to develop both
23:54 sides to have balance so that i just put
23:57 like yeah algorithms on one side and
23:58 data on the other side so it's not like
24:00 one over the other but both
24:02 at the same time
24:04 and people seem to be able to relate to
24:06 that yeah yeah can you walk us through
24:08 the process so let's say about uh i
24:11 don't know catapult or the airplane
24:13 like how
24:15 from the moment you got an idea i don't
24:17 know
24:18 how it appear like first did you want to
24:20 create something on data centric ai or
24:23 first you had an image of your plane in
24:25 your head and then you did this like
24:28 maybe you can walk us through the entire
24:29 process from the very beginning before
24:32 you even started working on this to the
24:33 end where you publish this on linkedin
24:36 how does it yeah so so to be honest i
24:38 don't have any like a very rigid idea
24:41 but what
24:42 i normally do is that i mean whatever
24:45 i'm learning whatever i'm reading on
24:46 that day
24:47 uh whatever that's interesting i will
24:49 list down
24:50 the concepts and especially because um i
24:53 mentioned about me starting machine
24:55 learning quite some time ago but the
24:56 fact is that i have left the field
24:58 for quite some time and in only in the
25:00 past couple of years i started to revive
25:02 my interests so all this is also first
25:04 and foremost is for me uh is part of my
25:07 real learning journey so whenever i'm
25:09 reading a new concept whenever i'm
25:10 trying to understand a new
25:12 um a new yeah a new material
25:15 uh first and foremost for me to be able
25:17 to understand the concept and for me to
25:18 be able to get to the core of the
25:20 message
25:20 um i'll just list down the concepts
25:22 without without i mean adding any
25:24 visuals i'll just list down things that
25:26 i find interesting that i read um new
25:28 concepts that i've learned and
25:30 put in put them in in a long list
25:33 because not always the idea will come
25:34 immediately so so the moment you you
25:37 start to have the list you can i mean i
25:40 would for example review it uh on a
25:42 weekly basis uh if i found something i
25:45 mean
25:46 a team that is always occurring from
25:48 what i'm learning and reading during
25:50 that week i uh that i thought would be
25:52 interesting for me to to nail my
25:54 understanding i would put it like in the
25:57 short list for me to visualize
25:59 so once i i've got the shortlist then
26:01 only i try to figure out the
26:03 the way for me to visualize these
26:05 concepts and like what i mentioned just
26:07 now i just try to elaborate a bit more
26:08 now is that for now what's been working
26:11 for me is that
26:12 for me to understand visuals uh for me
26:15 to be able to create visuals that is
26:17 understandable it can fall under these
26:18 two main categories one is metaphors the
26:21 other one is abstract concepts
26:23 abstract means
26:25 like what jack butch is doing like just
26:26 basic shapes basic basic arrows and
26:30 lines
26:30 um you you you try to create something
26:33 out of it
26:35 so that's when i start to think about uh
26:39 back to work what i was saying just now
26:40 like for each concept i want to
26:42 visualize what is the
26:43 the key message so i think that's also
26:45 part of the
26:47 um
26:48 learning aspect that
26:49 when you're trying to learning something
26:51 uh to learn something what you
26:53 want to try to
26:55 get to is that what is the essence of
26:57 the concept that you're trying to learn
26:58 for example uh yeah back to drift
27:02 the essence what you're trying to learn
27:03 is that things are changing uh whether
27:06 from a source or from a target and
27:07 you're trying to
27:09 trying to adapt to that so that's that's
27:11 the the the
27:12 the concept that you try to
27:14 get to the bottom two and from there
27:16 um yeah you decide on how you want to be
27:19 you decide on what kind i mean you try
27:20 to figure out what's the verb what the
27:22 message what's the key message what it
27:24 means and then you try to
27:26 to
27:27 translate it into a visual
27:31 so there are there are there are
27:33 i would say different kinds of
27:35 categories of the kinds of visuals that
27:37 i find
27:38 interesting for me to make one is
27:40 concept
27:41 uh like a concept machine learning like
27:43 data center ai and
27:45 drifts
27:46 and all this
27:47 but the other thing is that it's also
27:49 very interesting to
27:50 to
27:51 to visualize is the emotional aspect
27:54 when i say emotionally i'm talking about
27:56 the realities in the field um for
27:58 example what people say
28:00 uh machine learning is and what it
28:02 really is in the field because people
28:03 can relate to that uh for example when
28:06 we talk about um creating a data science
28:08 project and data science solutions right
28:10 um so normally what you want to do is
28:12 you start with a problem then you walk
28:14 your way towards the solution but
28:17 a lot of people
28:18 me first and foremost are always guilty
28:20 to to start with a solution first and be
28:22 able to and work backwards to try to
28:25 find a problem that can be solved by
28:27 solution because you're so invested and
28:28 they're so interested in the algorithm
28:31 or the solution that you are you're
28:32 building
28:34 so yeah what if you can visualize that
28:36 what if you can just show that actually
28:38 the arrow should be from the left to
28:39 right but what you're doing is from the
28:41 left to right so you try to touch these
28:43 emotional points in uh
28:45 from from the the viewer then they can
28:48 totally relate and they can totally
28:49 understand where where you're coming
28:51 from so that's also something that is
28:52 interesting for me for me for for me to
28:54 explore as i do this i remember this
28:57 visual as well so i think it's uh
29:00 you have on one side you have
29:02 the the way it should be and then others
29:04 the other side the way we do it right
29:07 then i think it got quite
29:09 some engagement right people could
29:11 relate to this thing and uh
29:13 okay yeah so if i summarize uh so what
29:16 you do is like every day you read things
29:18 you consume content and then you keep a
29:21 long list of things
29:23 where
29:24 like okay i read today let's say about
29:27 uh
29:28 um drift right and then you take a note
29:30 and then some things they
29:34 you know they you see that they are more
29:36 important you read more about them they
29:38 are interesting for you then you start
29:40 spending more time
29:41 learning about them and then you move
29:43 them from the long list with ideas to
29:46 the short list of ideas and then from
29:48 that shortlist you take some ideas there
29:51 and you start
29:52 trying to elaborate this idea try to
29:55 think about uh you know how can you see
29:58 the action there how you extract the
29:59 verb
30:00 from there right and then you also
30:02 mentioned that there are two categories
30:05 uh
30:06 categories
30:07 like two kinds of visuals categories
30:12 like up concepts right and then this
30:14 they also try to convey emotional aspect
30:17 did they summarize it correctly so long
30:19 list shortlist
30:20 getting some inspiration
30:22 uh brainstorming and then actually
30:24 sitting down and creating the visual
30:26 yeah but to be frank it doesn't always
30:27 work that way for example while you're
30:29 in the shower or while you're driving so
30:31 that's when the idea come to you and
30:33 that's why it's handy for you to
30:34 to have a sketchbook that is dedicated
30:36 like for me i have like just dedicated
30:38 for the visuals whenever i have the idea
30:41 no matter
30:42 i have figured out the concept yet i
30:44 just draw what what i i i think and it's
30:47 also useful for you to have like an app
30:49 that you can immediately write down the
30:51 ideas for example is that you don't have
30:53 ideas for visuals yet but you have
30:55 something in mind you just write it down
30:57 an app that is like for you to very
30:59 quickly
31:00 log in what you have uh
31:03 you have thought uh in your mind so that
31:05 that has been handy for me so
31:07 do you use like a voice recorder or you
31:09 type
31:10 so i i type
31:12 okay
31:13 yeah so what do you use for creating the
31:16 actual visuals
31:17 so i use figma
31:20 so like i said i don't have any
31:22 background in in design at all so i'm a
31:24 pure engineer so
31:26 i have been an
31:27 engineer for many years so i also don't
31:30 i mean i wouldn't say i'm
31:33 anywhere near the category of people who
31:35 have this artistic skills nothing like
31:37 that
31:38 so uh
31:40 i've tried canva before
31:42 when during my days with
31:44 creating contents for for add square so
31:46 i use a lot of canvas so that's when i i
31:49 export
31:50 that tool
31:51 but
31:52 it doesn't have that much flexibility so
31:55 i've also tried illustrator adobe
31:57 illustrator so that's way too advanced
31:59 for me because it has all this learning
32:01 curve that you have to go through before
32:03 you
32:04 can become comfortable in in the in the
32:06 with using the tool but when i was
32:08 introduced with figma and that again
32:10 came from from jack that he explains in
32:13 his course that he was using this
32:15 it's like a sweet spot between canva and
32:17 illustrator so it's not that hard to
32:20 operate but you have a lot of
32:22 flexibility for you to be able to
32:25 to
32:26 to create designs that that is exactly
32:28 like what you want so the learning curve
32:30 is very
32:31 not steep at all uh you can get up and
32:34 running in couple of days uh if i can do
32:36 it then i think most of other people can
32:38 do it as well because um yeah i mean
32:40 i've only been exposed to canva before a
32:42 little bit of illustrator not much
32:45 then i went to fema and i found like wow
32:47 it's really something that uh that
32:50 that that is interesting to me there are
32:52 other tools as well
32:53 for example if you are because for me my
32:56 my approach is more on
32:58 again being an engineer more on the
33:00 geometric geometric shapes uh
33:03 vectors vector images but there are
33:05 other apps that if you are more artistic
33:08 that you you prefer hand sketch there
33:10 are other tools as well i can remember
33:12 the name now um even figma but there are
33:14 other
33:16 uh sorry i can remember the name now but
33:18 there are if you are more into hand
33:19 sketch there are other tools that is not
33:21 as hard as photoshop illustrator that
33:23 you can get up and running
33:25 very quickly so i've been using that
33:28 since the beginning
33:30 yeah so you have a sketch node where you
33:33 take sketches the moment you have an
33:35 idea or sometimes just uh notes right
33:38 and then you use figma to
33:40 actually
33:42 create the visual right yeah
33:45 do you always first create a draft like
33:47 on uh on a piece of paper before moving
33:50 to figma yeah yeah so most of the time
33:54 uh i will write down on the paper first
33:56 because
33:57 um
33:58 because
33:59 yeah because the idea is not really
34:01 fully developed yet you have
34:04 a basic concept of what you want to do
34:05 but for example you haven't figured out
34:06 what kind of object you're going to put
34:08 but you only for example have figured
34:10 out the relationships yeah like
34:12 one thing is here the other thing is
34:13 there you want to make an arrow you want
34:14 to
34:16 create a contrast or something like that
34:18 but you haven't figured out the the end
34:20 product yet so once you put it down
34:23 somehow
34:24 it's uh ingrained in your mind when it
34:27 comes to for you to to start processing
34:30 in the back of your mind so like after a
34:32 couple of days you start to get
34:35 or to figure out what you want to do
34:36 that's when i transferred to to feed
34:38 more but of course again it isn't always
34:41 um
34:42 it's not always the case because
34:43 sometimes you immediately get the idea
34:45 and immediately i jump on my end for me
34:47 to do to do it uh immediately and i
34:49 think more and more now because the
34:52 amount of visuals that i've made
34:54 has grown so what i'm able to do now is
34:57 that i have a lot of these existing
34:59 assets that i can immediately just copy
35:01 and paste from different concepts for me
35:03 to to create something new because it's
35:05 not always the case that you're creating
35:07 something from scratch so you can
35:08 utilize the kinds of objects the kinds
35:10 of i mean high-level concepts that that
35:12 you have from other
35:14 visuals that you made and you reuse it
35:17 and you modify it according to to the
35:19 new thing that you want to create
35:21 so if you need a catapult or a basket
35:23 you just go to the drift
35:26 visual right you copy the catapult and
35:28 paste to the new image and use it yeah
35:30 that's cool
35:31 that's handy
35:33 yeah so how
35:35 for somebody who is uh
35:37 who is like you who is an engineer who
35:39 hasn't uh
35:41 who
35:41 have never worked with anything like
35:44 figma who maybe doesn't even know what
35:46 figma is how can they start
35:50 creating visuals
35:52 how can they learn this
35:53 so
35:55 first take jack's course so i cannot
35:57 recommend it highly enough but yeah yeah
36:00 so again it's very irony because uh jack
36:03 butcher he's someone who
36:05 who has been a designer for many years
36:06 like 10 years
36:08 but what he has taught me is that you
36:09 don't have to be designer to be able to
36:12 create such visuals
36:13 in fact i found that the
36:16 the the bug that you have which is not
36:18 being able to
36:19 to
36:21 you don't have the designer brain is is
36:23 that it can turn into your biggest
36:25 feature because the thing is that
36:27 if you are focused on the design part
36:29 you are
36:30 losing or you're not focusing as much on
36:32 the message or the perspective that you
36:34 want to convey because for me that's the
36:36 most important thing because what you
36:38 want to do is you want to focus on the
36:39 perspective
36:40 uh over the aesthetics because if you're
36:43 focusing more on the aesthetics like how
36:44 does it look like uh how would it turn
36:46 out
36:47 you don't spend as much time in terms of
36:50 what you really want to
36:52 uh for what you really want the people
36:54 who look at your visuals to be able to
36:56 to get so the moment you again back to
36:58 constraints the moment you put this
37:00 constraint the moment you
37:02 uh understand that this is the the level
37:04 of aesthetic that you
37:07 can go and not be on that that's when
37:08 you spend all your energy
37:10 in trying to uh deliver the perspective
37:13 that you want to
37:14 to convey i found it very uh
37:18 yeah very interesting to be able to get
37:19 that perspective uh
37:21 that is actually something that will
37:24 empower you
37:25 so that's that so that's from the i
37:27 guess philosophical aspect but from the
37:29 practical aspect
37:30 you just have to
37:32 start uh playing with things because the
37:35 moment you start to put things down
37:38 that's when you will develop and
37:40 of course it comes with practice so
37:42 [Music]
37:43 like for me i remember in the beginning
37:45 i was very
37:47 pumped up to start creating such visuals
37:49 because i got some like
37:50 seven or ten ideas that just came the
37:52 moment i i look at this this other
37:54 content from jack and other creators
37:56 like him
37:57 so i start to write down i start to
37:59 to create these visuals
38:01 around 10 of them
38:03 and then i was ready to start posting
38:05 but then i thought to myself
38:07 after that what's next i don't have any
38:09 idea for for the rest of what i'm
38:11 supposed to do i only have this 10 but i
38:13 totally don't have any idea
38:15 beyond that so i did i just started
38:17 posting
38:18 and that's when it's slowly developed
38:20 and that's when more ideas start to come
38:21 in uh that's when i think you start to
38:24 try to be able to to relate to what
38:26 you're learning instead of for example
38:28 before when you're reading consuming a
38:30 content you're just
38:31 doing it
38:33 just for consuming but when you approach
38:35 or when you start to consume a content
38:37 with the intention for you to create
38:39 something for you to learn and for you
38:41 to explain to others using visuals
38:43 that's when
38:44 that's when you you start to to get
38:46 ideas coming in and yeah um it will it
38:49 will
38:50 uh yeah it will not stop
38:52 [Music]
38:54 yeah
38:54 you mentioned uh think that having a
38:57 designer brain is helpful because you
38:59 can focus on the message not on
39:01 aesthetics and i remember
39:03 well even though i am not a designer
39:05 let's say when i need to create a
39:07 presentation
39:09 i sometimes spend too much time on you
39:12 know making the like i don't know moving
39:15 things there making it look perfect
39:18 while what i should be doing instead is
39:20 instead of you know creating a great
39:22 slide i should just focus on what i'm
39:24 going to say
39:25 in this slide and maybe this light can
39:27 be just empty right
39:29 so focusing on the message instead of
39:31 focusing on how your slide looks like
39:32 and here i think it's similar like you
39:34 really focus on
39:36 what you want to draw instead of
39:38 how
39:39 nice it looks and yeah and i saw i also
39:42 realized that the other thing that the
39:44 men you create such visuals that are
39:46 minimal that are not really focusing on
39:47 the aesthetics what you're doing really
39:49 is you're respecting people's time
39:51 um because i mean yeah there are people
39:54 are busy they have so many things to to
39:56 do in work and also to i mean for them
39:59 to to what if they are learning for them
40:01 to consume content for them to
40:03 understand concern and the other thing
40:04 again this this other
40:06 quote from jack that i really for
40:07 interesting is that what he's doing is
40:09 that he's doing uh he's working hard to
40:11 give people less
40:13 so yeah so i think that's the whole
40:15 point i mean you're respecting people's
40:16 time because you are
40:18 giving it as it is immediately what
40:20 people want to
40:23 receive probably what people want to
40:24 consume and
40:26 convert i mean also on the other side
40:28 you are help i mean you are
40:32 is being easy to yourself that means you
40:34 are i mean
40:35 you
40:36 make your life easier because you're not
40:38 really worried about things that you're
40:40 not supposed to be worried you're just
40:41 worried about things that you need to
40:42 focus on which is again the message and
40:45 the perspective and yeah so it seems to
40:47 be a great combination
40:49 and other thing you mentioned is
40:51 consumed with intention to create
40:53 something so can you tell us how it
40:56 works
40:57 so
40:58 [Music]
41:00 so the same way i think it's true for
41:02 visuals and other
41:03 other ways as well so the moment you
41:06 consume a content with a view for you to
41:09 explain or teach to others your
41:11 perspective becomes different because
41:13 the moment you have the intention to
41:14 teach i mean you're more invested
41:16 because you're not really looking at the
41:18 material on the surface you're trying to
41:20 dig deep and if need be you will look at
41:22 other materials that are supplementing
41:24 what you're trying to understand
41:26 and what happens to you is that you get
41:28 to the bottom of
41:29 what you want to know and compare that
41:32 with
41:33 learning just for you to
41:36 for you to consume
41:37 your understanding first and foremost is
41:39 totally different you get a much deeper
41:41 understanding so let alone the the fact
41:43 that you are going to create something
41:45 with visuals or anything the fact that
41:47 you have the intention of explaining it
41:49 to others
41:50 while you're questioning something makes
41:52 it like at least 10 times more impact
41:55 compared to without it
41:58 it's like the the best way to learn
42:00 something is to teach it right drive
42:02 and
42:03 practically the way it works is let's
42:05 say when you read an article you think
42:08 okay this is a cool article if i wanted
42:10 to explain this article in a single
42:13 image what this image would be right or
42:16 what's the main idea in this article
42:18 that they can take away and turn this
42:19 into a visual
42:21 is it does it work like that yeah
42:23 because because when you're reading like
42:26 we're consuming content
42:29 i mean on the surface level what you are
42:31 getting is what what it is that's it
42:34 what it is
42:35 but if you're
42:38 learning it with the intention of
42:39 explaining it to others what you
42:42 try to get to the bottom is also
42:45 like what it is not
42:47 or what can go wrong what if you did
42:49 that instead of what you have been shown
42:51 so you start to look at other
42:52 perspective and angle
42:54 and not just be one dimensional when you
42:56 consume content so
42:58 that's when you start to
43:00 to to to try to to
43:03 to think how to instead of um sorry
43:07 think of what if instead of instead of
43:08 how to
43:10 so yeah so if you are given a step right
43:12 how to do
43:13 abc how to train a machine learning
43:15 algorithm so you have these steps
43:17 yeah that's fine but the moment you
43:19 start to think about what can go wrong
43:21 what else is missing what if i do
43:22 another what if i do it without machine
43:24 learning so those are normally things
43:26 that you don't think about if you're
43:27 just consuming but if you are planning
43:29 to teach it to others
43:31 definitely those are the things that you
43:32 will definitely need to keep in mind
43:34 that you will explore and try to
43:35 discover
43:37 how do you find
43:39 how do you come up with this what if
43:41 things
43:42 or
43:43 what can go wrong like if you have
43:46 practical experience then maybe you can
43:48 use this practical experience but if
43:50 you're just learning this thing how can
43:51 you know about these things so
43:55 i guess if you are talking about i mean
43:57 coding for
43:58 for for machine learning right you just
44:00 explore
44:01 ways how to break uh
44:03 break
44:04 a code for example you take someone
44:06 something that someone else has done for
44:08 example he shares a code on a medium
44:10 block for example right with with other
44:12 person shares something that over there
44:14 and with a code example so you try not
44:16 just to run the code but also try to
44:18 make changes and see what if i you were
44:20 to change this parameter what if you
44:21 were to change this even algorithm and
44:25 i mean the many thousand things that you
44:26 can change and see what happens so you
44:29 start to think about
44:30 because your goal now is
44:33 to be able to understand in totality not
44:35 just how it's being presented to you so
44:38 you're forcing yourself to
44:40 look at it from from different ways and
44:41 try to really
44:43 nail down your understanding
44:47 yeah thanks so since 2019 you said you
44:52 you're self-employed so you don't work
44:54 for you don't have uh like you don't
44:56 work for a company you work for yourself
44:58 and
44:59 i think you mentioned you were doing
45:00 some sort of consulting training but
45:02 also i guess
45:04 making visuals is part of what you do so
45:07 you're making some money with your
45:09 visualization skills can you tell us
45:11 more how you earn money with this
45:14 yeah so now it's slowly becoming one of
45:16 the main things that i'm doing these
45:17 days
45:18 so starting early this year i've started
45:20 to introduce this visual design service
45:24 that helps
45:26 companies content creators who has a
45:29 message
45:30 that want to turn that message into
45:32 visual so that they can uh uh so then so
45:36 that the audience that they that that uh
45:38 i mean consuming their content and
45:39 trying to understand their products and
45:41 services be able to get immediately what
45:44 uh they are trying to uh to serve and
45:47 the value proposition and so on and so
45:49 forth so currently i'm working mostly
45:51 with um
45:53 machine learning and data platform
45:55 startups
45:56 that are looking to
45:57 to grow their business and even content
46:00 creators who are trying to uh that are
46:02 currently mostly
46:04 creating text based content who also
46:06 wants to
46:07 to
46:08 to
46:09 to expand that into visual content for
46:12 them to be able to to deliver what they
46:14 uh their message in a more more clear
46:16 way so that's something that i've been
46:18 doing
46:18 uh since the beginning of the year so
46:20 it's something that is very enjoyable
46:22 for me because not just from
46:24 my own perspective but also from
46:26 what the other party wants to convey
46:29 from from what what uh what they have
46:32 and in a way it's also a challenge for
46:33 me as well because there are
46:35 there are
46:36 there are new things that i need to
46:37 explore that i need to force myself to
46:39 understand because i mean different
46:40 company for example if you're talking
46:42 about machine learning companies so
46:44 there are companies that are doing data
46:45 platforms there are companies that do
46:47 explainability there are companies that
46:49 do
46:50 um
46:51 ml ops end-to-end
46:54 so yeah so before i can help them with
46:57 creating visuals i need to be able to
46:59 understand their product offering as
47:00 first and foremost so of course that
47:03 takes
47:04 some wrapping up for me to to
47:07 do
47:07 for me to ramp up my understanding first
47:10 and foremost
47:11 but of course it's a rewarding journey
47:12 as well because i get to understand
47:14 in a more intimate way compared to just
47:16 looking at it from from from outside so
47:19 yeah so that's something that i've been
47:20 doing a lot more these days compared to
47:23 what i used to do before
47:25 so you first started publishing these
47:27 visualizations
47:28 on social media on linkedin twitter
47:32 and then did companies start to reach
47:34 out to you or how did you
47:36 make it clear that you're
47:38 this is something you can offer and they
47:40 can't come to you for these kind of
47:42 services yeah so it started with um
47:45 people i mean companies and people
47:47 starting to reach out to me to to ask if
47:50 i do such surgeries
47:52 initially i didn't do any because i was
47:54 just doing it for for myself
47:56 so i started to see interests so i took
47:58 my as well for me to to work together
48:00 with them so that yeah
48:01 what i've been doing in the past few
48:03 months is that i've started to do some
48:05 kind of outbound
48:07 uh reach out to people and companies
48:09 that might be interested and yeah so
48:11 slowly uh building that service side of
48:15 of the business
48:16 yeah that's interesting so basically
48:18 first you started you didn't start with
48:20 intention of earning money but you
48:22 started with the intention of
48:24 you know exploring this area using this
48:26 skill trying to convey your message and
48:28 you mentioned that you're also learning
48:30 or relearning machine learning so for
48:32 you it was just a way to
48:35 consume and sort of regurgitate the
48:36 content right and then show this is my
48:39 vision this is my take on these things
48:41 and then you did this regularly and then
48:43 at some point companies noticed this and
48:45 thought okay this is so cool we also
48:48 want to have something similar we wanted
48:49 somebody to come to us listen to what we
48:52 do and explain it in a simple visual
48:55 right
48:57 oh cool
49:00 one thing you mentioned that sometimes
49:01 there is a bunch of text based
49:04 information i imagine an article
49:06 and then you think how to add visuals to
49:08 this article right did they understand
49:10 correctly that companies sometimes come
49:12 to you
49:13 with uh for this service
49:16 for example there are companies that
49:18 have blog posts
49:19 that explains a concept that they want
49:22 to convey or product or service
49:24 so yeah so to add a visual to that
49:27 basically to summarize whatever that
49:29 they are trying to
49:30 deliver in their in that blog blog
49:32 content so there are also companies that
49:35 want to create
49:36 like marketing material as well
49:39 there are companies want to who are
49:40 creating ebooks
49:42 like downloadable ebooks that explain
49:44 concept so adding visuals will really
49:47 uh give a greater impact into what what
49:50 um what they want to to to explain in in
49:53 that material what people for example
49:56 and there are a few other ways as well
49:58 that i'm i'm currently working on
50:01 cool and this is all without having a
50:03 designer background
50:06 can you maybe tell us a bit about this
50:09 so you get an article which is just text
50:11 the wall of text and nothing i imagine
50:14 that for me as a reader this is probably
50:16 a boring article because i cannot scheme
50:18 it i have no idea what it is and then it
50:21 must be quite interesting for me to
50:23 actually convince myself
50:25 and invest time in reading this article
50:27 and when i create content
50:29 i understand that i need to make it
50:32 easier to
50:33 to scheme to understand what this is
50:36 but i always have problems
50:38 with okay i have this piece of text how
50:41 do i add visuals there how do i add
50:43 instructions there or illustrations
50:45 there
50:46 do you have some suggestions for people
50:48 like me
50:49 who can come up with text
50:52 but struggle with coming up with
50:54 illustrations
50:56 so what has worked well for me
50:58 and it's also the same way like if i
51:00 were to consume the content myself is
51:02 that
51:03 so first you take a first pass on on the
51:05 text and what you do is you
51:07 try to extract the keywords like the top
51:10 four or five keywords that is always
51:12 appearing and the keyword that you you
51:14 think
51:15 um the
51:17 is the key message of
51:19 let's say a blog post for example so
51:21 once you have listed down all the
51:23 keywords
51:24 back to
51:25 the idea that i was
51:27 explaining about just now is that you
51:28 try to understand not just
51:30 what they are but what they mean what
51:32 they're trying to convey and more often
51:34 than not you'll be able to find a team
51:36 of what
51:37 they're trying to do let's say for
51:38 example
51:39 um you're talking about the solution and
51:41 data platform that is trying to reduce
51:43 the number of steps for for some and i
51:46 mean a non-technical
51:48 person to be able to access the data
51:50 from four steps into two steps
51:53 so what you can probably do is something
51:55 like uh
51:57 a comparison of like the number of hooks
51:59 the number of
52:00 uh steps that the person needs to take
52:03 with
52:04 without the solution for example you
52:06 just draw it like that and then on the
52:08 other side it's like yo just take two
52:09 steps as simple as that so that's a
52:11 simple example but you can always play
52:13 around with many different different
52:15 kinds of concepts for example
52:17 is it a cycle
52:18 is it
52:19 about contrast between a concept and the
52:22 other concept so you can
52:24 for contrast you can talk about like
52:26 um
52:27 you can talk about like black and white
52:29 so you can imagine you can immediately
52:31 tell that one concept is totally
52:32 different from the other while being in
52:34 the same
52:36 space for example and there are other
52:38 things like balance dimension is now you
52:40 can imagine a scale that talks about one
52:42 concept that is more important than the
52:43 others or even if they are the same
52:47 many many objects that you can think of
52:49 like slider if you're talking about a
52:51 spectrum of different ways for you to do
52:53 things and you want to convey that
52:55 actually you need to put the slider
52:57 somewhere in the middle or somewhere to
52:59 the right to convey that yeah that's the
53:02 kind of emphasis that you need to put
53:04 whenever you're considering the two
53:05 concepts so there are a number of ways
53:07 um
53:08 that you can you can play around and
53:11 yeah with error you will normally be
53:13 able to find it eventually
53:16 and so
53:18 pass over an article extract four or
53:20 five keywords and then try to understand
53:22 what is the key message uh what is uh
53:25 what is the main takeaway from the
53:27 article for the reader right and then
53:29 you try to visualize it um follow
53:32 through
53:32 and i guess follow the same process as
53:34 we discussed like half an hour ago right
53:37 okay and this is this way you create a
53:40 visual for the entire article right but
53:42 what uh
53:43 let's say you have one paragraph that
53:46 explains some something else one section
53:48 then another section that is maybe
53:50 talking about a little bit different
53:52 thing i guess you apply the same process
53:54 right you take a section you try to
53:56 understand what is the key message of
53:58 this section and then you try to come up
54:00 with a visual that illustrates this key
54:02 concept is it correct yeah so
54:05 i mean
54:06 there is a point where you can
54:09 create
54:10 like what you mentioned is a long-form
54:12 kind of visual instead of just one
54:13 visual like maybe five or more visuals
54:16 that that are in the same
54:18 same
54:19 article or content so there is a point
54:21 where you can relate these visuals but
54:23 there is a point exactly what you say
54:25 that the concepts are totally different
54:26 that you cannot really relate them
54:28 yeah i mean in that case you cannot push
54:30 yourself and try to create something
54:32 because now you're diluting the value
54:34 i think the most important is for you to
54:35 be able number number one is for you to
54:38 be able to deliver the message
54:39 efficiently
54:40 and the bonus if you can be able to
54:42 relate different concepts
54:44 like if you were to split different
54:46 visuals into different concepts i think
54:48 that would be a bonus i think one
54:49 example that i
54:51 managed to do it is by by talking about
54:54 this concept about uh data science or
54:56 machine learning that essentially it
54:58 boils down to just five kinds of
54:59 questions or five kinds of problems that
55:02 it wants to solve like classification
55:03 regression anomaly detection clustering
55:06 and also reinforcement learning so just
55:09 i mean any machine learning problem you
55:11 can boil or categorize them into this
55:13 these different categories so these are
55:15 the
55:16 this this article from microsoft so i
55:18 figured out a way for me to be able to
55:20 really relate this this
55:22 these different five concepts using the
55:24 same base visuals which is like the same
55:27 kinds of data points
55:29 and
55:30 imposing different
55:32 perspectives according to
55:34 each of the five concepts
55:36 so that people can relate it because if
55:38 you
55:39 have the visual
55:40 but different visuals for different
55:41 concepts it doesn't give as much impact
55:44 but
55:45 but yeah if you can somehow relate them
55:47 because there is a logical connection
55:49 over there even though yeah it's not
55:51 that easy to come up with that
55:53 immediately but if you think through
55:54 about it
55:56 yeah if you can manage to relate them i
55:58 think that's a bonus
56:00 yeah thanks uh i also know that you
56:03 wrote a book because you recently came
56:04 to data talks club slack and you
56:07 answered questions about your book so
56:09 can you tell us
56:11 about your book and how did you come up
56:12 with
56:13 the idea behind the book
56:16 so
56:18 same thing is first and foremost for me
56:19 to be able to nail my understanding of
56:22 the concept
56:23 so by writing the book it forces me to
56:26 really get to the
56:29 the bottom in terms of understanding the
56:31 concept from the ground up
56:33 for example um not relying on frameworks
56:35 such as tensorflow or by torch but
56:37 instead
56:38 building
56:39 a simple neural network from scratch
56:42 including doing all this back
56:43 propagation and all the
56:45 the i mean the materials from scratch
56:48 and
56:49 that's
56:50 is forcing me to i mean i mean the fact
56:52 that i i'm looking to to create the book
56:55 forces me to to do all these uh steps
56:59 and
57:00 that of course gave me the idea of of
57:02 creating content that is based on the
57:04 journey that i went through by learning
57:07 the the material
57:10 because
57:11 i find that deep learning and neural
57:13 networks is especially interesting
57:14 because
57:16 it's a is
57:17 compared to other algorithms of course
57:19 you're talking if you're talking about
57:20 applications if you're talking about the
57:22 kinds of um excitement that is that is
57:24 that is here today there's something
57:25 else but i'm talking more about
57:28 like how it's very modular it's
57:30 something that you can start simple that
57:32 you can build upon so i thought that it
57:34 would be an interesting idea for me to
57:36 try to create like a book that explains
57:38 the concept from ground up because
57:41 you can you can expand from as much as
57:43 you can from a very
57:45 simple neural network which is a single
57:46 neuron so how do you start from a single
57:48 neuron
57:50 to like a neural network with just one
57:52 hidden layer to an even bigger neural
57:54 network so it all starts with a single
57:57 neuron and you're basically having these
57:59 lego bricks that you can build and make
58:01 a big a big a big lego structure
58:03 so
58:04 yeah i thought that that would be a
58:05 natural wave a natural subject for me to
58:08 convert that into a visual way of
58:10 explaining things
58:12 and
58:13 and yeah by writing the book i
58:16 i mean of course it forms up my
58:18 understanding as well but i think the
58:19 other part that is interesting to me is
58:21 that i i i
58:23 i can
58:24 i was i was able to to connect the
58:27 different concepts together
58:28 and
58:29 [Music]
58:31 be able to come up with this business uh
58:33 and to end so-called story because the
58:34 other thing that i've also
58:37 tried to do and whenever i'm creating
58:39 content or any material is that i try to
58:43 tie together the whole thing into a
58:45 story that people can navigate and
58:46 people can have a logical flow from
58:49 start to finish
58:50 so that's what i've uh i've tried to do
58:52 with this book
58:56 yeah did you first come up with text and
58:58 then created illustrations or you first
59:00 came up with illustrations and then
59:02 wrote some text around them
59:07 so
59:08 so i started with the concepts the big
59:10 concepts
59:11 and then
59:12 i
59:15 start to create visuals i start to for
59:17 example imagine the number of pages the
59:19 number of sections
59:20 then i make this
59:22 placeholders for me to draw these
59:24 visuals and then i start to fill in
59:25 based on the concept
59:27 then only i add the
59:30 the text that explains explain the each
59:32 of the visual because if you look at the
59:34 book the text is actually very minimal
59:35 so it is
59:39 i'm hoping for people who don't have
59:41 that much time for them to digest the
59:42 content but
59:44 can get enough value to understand the
59:46 concept so it's visuals first and
59:48 supplemented by just concise uh tags so
59:51 so that's the text part is something
59:52 that i do
59:53 after i've i've filmed up the logical
59:56 steps on on
59:57 creating creating the content
1:00:01 and i think we forgot to mention the
1:00:03 name of the book so the name is a visual
1:00:04 introduction to deep learning right
1:00:08 i think we should be wrapping up
1:00:10 do you want to
1:00:12 say anything before we finish
1:00:15 i think that's it so i think
1:00:18 of course i want to thank you for for
1:00:19 having me here it's really a pleasure
