1:14 um
1:15 are you ready
1:17 i'm ready
1:19 okay i
1:21 think i'm also ready so let's start so
1:24 this week we'll talk about career
1:26 changing and we have a special guest
1:28 today jessica
1:29 um as you might have guessed from the
1:31 title jessica was roasting coffee
1:34 working as a barista at some point
1:36 but then she decided to learn python and
1:39 eventually she switched careers and
1:40 started working as backend developer
1:44 i know jessica because she is one of the
1:45 students of our course machine learning
1:47 zumcam
1:49 and this is how
1:51 i got to know her
1:53 and
1:54 i saw that her career is quite
1:56 interesting
1:57 and that's why i thought it's a good
2:00 idea to invite her to this podcast so
2:02 welcome
2:05 yeah thank you it's a real honor to join
2:08 um and be able to connect more with the
2:10 community the day of talks club
2:12 community and the zoom camp was amazing
2:15 if folks have not already checked out
2:17 which i'm sure there's no one listening
2:19 to this who has not already checked out
2:21 you definitely should it's great
2:24 yeah thanks so thanks for
2:26 taking that course so let's start with
2:28 your background so i already told
2:31 everyone who is listening
2:33 to this that you have quite an
2:34 interesting career so maybe can you tell
2:37 us about your career journey so far
2:41 yes and i saw you said keep it brief so
2:43 i will try stick to that um
2:46 because it's a little bit of a you know
2:48 non-traditional background this is
2:50 actually my third career i uh studied
2:53 and first worked in the film industry
2:55 um but at some point i found myself in
2:57 germany and i was working in coffee
2:59 doing coffee roasting is incredibly
3:02 interesting field in its own right
3:05 but i kind of had decided i wanted to
3:07 make a switch i was looking for
3:08 something a little bit maybe more
3:10 financially stable a little bit more and
3:12 work life balance
3:14 and i had this concept around
3:17 potentially being able to get into the
3:18 tech industry i know some folks or i
3:21 really knew some folks here in berlin
3:22 who worked in that sector
3:24 um and there's lots of tech companies
3:26 here in fact i had been to tech
3:29 conferences uh making coffee for all the
3:31 participants so i had this kind of touch
3:34 point
3:34 um
3:35 and an idea of what it was about but
3:38 yeah how to go about that was of course
3:41 like not known to me
3:43 um and making that leap was something
3:46 that was very nerve-wracking
3:48 so i would consider myself self-taught
3:51 community taught
3:52 um and i think one of the things i
3:54 really want to promote is how much the
3:56 community supported me in my case at the
3:59 time that was predominantly the pi
4:01 ladies community that happened to be the
4:03 first one that i
4:04 went to and i just really connected with
4:06 the folks there um and that really drove
4:09 me to being at the point where i am now
4:11 as a back-end developer um working in
4:15 tech for like
4:17 close to four years i guess
4:18 um which yeah
4:20 is just been life-changing to be honest
4:24 yeah interesting so you
4:26 attended it conferences
4:29 as a barista i remember usually on
4:32 conferences for example the
4:34 pi data conference we recently
4:37 both of us attended there was like a
4:39 stand with coffee and somebody was
4:41 serving coffee to the participants so at
4:43 some point four years ago you were one
4:45 of such people
4:48 exactly and not only that i gave a
4:50 lightning talk at um
4:52 euro camp so
4:54 the ruby conference um and they said to
4:57 me oh why don't you come and give a talk
5:00 we do these lightning talks of course i
5:02 had no conception of what this was um
5:05 maybe you can do something around coffee
5:07 and
5:07 then i realized i had to get up on the
5:09 stage and talk to this huge group of
5:11 people um
5:13 but yeah that gave me an idea of course
5:15 about some of the
5:17 um fun parts i would say of the industry
5:20 um which were very appealing
5:24 so you were giving talks in front of it
5:27 audience before becoming like
5:30 before breaking into yourself so what
5:33 did you talk about
5:36 like about coffee of course i understand
5:38 but what exactly was that i'm just
5:40 curious
5:41 i was i gave a very brief talk about how
5:44 coffee traveled the world so mainly due
5:46 to colonialism but there's all these
5:48 kind of like
5:49 uh some truthful and some like um
5:53 embellished stories about how coffee
5:55 kind of got transported to all the
5:58 different countries that it now grows in
6:01 so and then you thought okay like it
6:02 seems like more financially stable
6:05 industry
6:06 let's
6:07 go there so how did you actually make
6:09 this transition so from the point when
6:11 you decided okay like coffee is not
6:15 like it's cool but you know i'm looking
6:17 for more something more financially
6:19 stable to the point where you
6:21 well i don't know started your as an
6:23 intern first right i don't
6:25 i think it was you started as an intern
6:27 right so how did it how did this happen
6:29 what did you do there
6:31 so i'm i think the first thing i did
6:34 which i
6:35 i
6:35 a lot of folks that i've spoke to do
6:37 something similar is i went online and i
6:40 searched for
6:42 like what is programming what courses
6:43 can i do and at the time the big
6:45 platform was code
6:47 um and i did a lot of their courses
6:50 which it's a really great platform
6:52 because it's browser-based so you
6:55 don't have a lot of the pain of having
6:56 to run things on your machine
6:59 at some point
7:01 you then have to to transition across to
7:03 actually running this things on your
7:05 machine and then it can be a little bit
7:06 more tricky
7:07 um but i started that way and really
7:09 just got a feel for like
7:12 does this interest me am i prepared to
7:14 sit and like you know spend a day trying
7:17 to figure out what this book is like i
7:20 think you just mentioned that you're
7:21 like currently trying to chase a bug and
7:23 like
7:24 you know i think there's certain people
7:27 you didn't pick yeah but not yet you
7:29 will not yet
7:30 i spent like four hours and still i have
7:32 no clue why it's not working
7:35 but you see there's people that couldn't
7:37 sit for four hours with that kind of
7:38 problem and that and that's what you
7:40 need to determine for yourself and
7:41 that's what i wanted to figure out for
7:43 myself is like am i prepared to put the
7:45 effort into this
7:46 for me the answer was definitely yes
7:48 like i get a lot of joy from coding um i
7:52 really like that it mixes like a
7:53 technical understanding with a
7:55 creativity
7:56 that i found in my other careers as well
8:00 um
8:01 and i also was quite supported by the
8:03 german government in terms of
8:05 financially being supported during this
8:07 learning process so
8:09 definitely would like to highlight that
8:10 because that was also a bit of a game
8:13 changer for me
8:15 and by support that you mean
8:18 you i know in germany you can do a boot
8:21 camp and then the government covers the
8:23 costs right
8:26 yeah so um they offer something
8:29 called um a vitamin goodshine in germany
8:32 it means like a voucher for further
8:34 education
8:36 um now in the last couple of years it's
8:39 very popular that the boot camps kind of
8:41 keyed into this
8:42 and um you can use this towards boot
8:45 camp
8:45 at the time when i was transitioning and
8:48 there wasn't no i'm not saying there was
8:49 none of these bootcamps but they weren't
8:51 as many as there are now so i didn't
8:54 really actually know about that option
8:56 so the abyss amp gave me one and i was
9:00 at a school that was like kind of a
9:02 corporate company and they mainly did
9:04 like courses for accountants
9:07 but essentially
9:09 i got to go there
9:11 not be like harassed about getting a job
9:13 and i had a computer and wi-fi and that
9:16 was really for me all i needed i was i'm
9:18 very self-directed i created like a
9:19 google calendar of like i'm going to
9:21 study maths for this hour and then i'm
9:23 going to look at this code academy
9:25 course and then i'm going to maybe do
9:27 like this challenge on
9:29 on code wars or something like this you
9:31 know um so i just needed time
9:34 and of course to have time you also need
9:36 money and that was something that the
9:38 german government really supported with
9:41 how do you know what to put on that
9:42 calendar because i imagine that
9:45 it could be over overwhelming like there
9:46 are so many options if you list if you
9:49 look at this
9:50 there are curricular online like how to
9:53 become a self-taught engineer and then
9:55 you see this chic checklist which is
9:57 like kilometer long right and then you
9:59 see and you had spins because you don't
10:01 know where to start right so how did you
10:04 uh with data science it's uh like even a
10:07 bigger problem right i think you have
10:09 all these thousands checklist everyone
10:11 every checklist is different with
10:13 backend engineering i think it's the
10:14 same so how did you prioritize how did
10:16 you decide what is uh right for you
10:20 yeah absolutely great question i think
10:22 um i've come across a lot of good
10:24 resources since i started out
10:26 so i really like some of these road maps
10:28 and that you can find that kind of give
10:30 you a high level of the things that
10:31 would be useful
10:33 um i did not have that so a lot of it
10:35 was kind of good feeling
10:37 um i knew i was really interested in
10:39 like data science as a topic but i
10:41 didn't really understand i mean i might
10:44 also still not really understand what
10:46 exactly that means for me
10:48 um
10:49 but i started with the andrea ing
10:51 machine learning course on coursera
10:54 um which is kind of like pretty in-depth
10:57 and it uses
10:59 matlab
11:00 sorry
11:02 not a language that i have
11:04 ever used or looked at since but um
11:07 i think i kind of directed it around
11:10 what i was really interested in
11:12 i also started doing a lot of um the
11:14 kind of
11:15 base courses that code academy offer and
11:18 i think um
11:19 now what i would recommend folks is the
11:21 free code camp
11:23 um curriculum that they have that's
11:25 really developed over the last few years
11:28 because you do need some direction
11:30 um i was totally overwhelmed and i have
11:34 learned some things that probably
11:36 were not that useful like i
11:38 well i enjoyed it but like i sat and did
11:40 a lot of like maths classes from like
11:42 stanford online and i'm not really sure
11:45 that in any way fits into what i do on a
11:47 day-to-day basis but
11:50 maybe it will come up
11:53 okay so you were was i correct when i
11:57 said that you picked python right so you
12:00 you
12:01 you studied python in code academy in
12:05 and
12:06 so you were learning python you were
12:08 learning math you were also taking this
12:10 android inc
12:11 class
12:12 and you said
12:14 you were sitting somewhere there was a
12:16 room with a computer with wi-fi right
12:19 um and then what happened next like how
12:21 did you get that internship how did you
12:23 go from learning math sitting somewhere
12:25 in front of a computer learning python
12:27 to actually
12:29 getting into
12:30 getting paid for what you do
12:33 so i was part of a really great program
12:35 called rails girls summer of code and
12:38 very sadly the year i joined um which
12:41 was 2018
12:44 was the last year that it ran
12:46 um this was a program that paid like
12:49 financially supported you to work on an
12:51 open source project for three months and
12:54 um you would have coaches and you would
12:56 work with people from the project
12:58 directly
13:00 it would look a little bit different for
13:01 each group of course and the other
13:03 amazing thing was you did it as a pair
13:06 so i saw this advertised and i thought
13:09 like oh that would be a great
13:10 opportunity to get some like real world
13:12 experience
13:14 um but i didn't know anybody else who
13:16 was learning to code so i just asked on
13:19 a slack group hey does anyone want to do
13:21 this with me
13:23 and i have very little response um but
13:25 this one amazing person rt um reached
13:28 out to me and we didn't know we were
13:30 complete strangers but we
13:32 met and then decided to go on this
13:34 journey together
13:36 um
13:37 which yeah was it was like very
13:40 intense way to learn about yourself and
13:43 about somebody else but that gave me the
13:45 opportunity then to go into the
13:48 application process with the kojo where
13:49 i now work
13:51 um
13:52 and say like hey i do kind of i don't
13:55 know this just on paper i also have the
13:57 experience of working with the team
13:59 um and
14:01 ultimately that's i i believe what we'll
14:03 say help me be successful
14:05 i think there is a similar thing you
14:07 said uh rails girls or
14:10 how was yes
14:12 i think there is a similar thing called
14:14 google summer of code at least from the
14:16 description of what you said
14:18 so google summer of course is they
14:21 give you some sort of scholarship
14:24 to work for a summer
14:26 on some open source project before
14:31 up until
14:32 last year i think it was only for
14:34 students but now you don't have to be a
14:36 student to actually take part in that
14:37 thing
14:39 exactly yeah i wanted to remove this
14:41 jurisdiction
14:43 yeah exactly i wanted to say that one
14:45 was for students only but they lifted it
14:46 and there's also another one um i don't
14:48 know if you're familiar with it
14:49 outreachy
14:52 it doesn't just run in summer so it
14:54 doesn't have a summer tag in there it
14:55 runs twice a year but it's a very
14:58 similar concept
15:00 so you get paid
15:02 for contributing to open source and you
15:04 get a mentor who helps you yeah that's
15:06 pretty cool so you did that there was a
15:09 person rt who were doing this with you
15:12 and then he connected you with people
15:14 from
15:16 kosair did i pronounce it correctly
15:18 because yeah yeah
15:20 and then you got your internship right
15:23 yeah so rtm
15:25 she and i did that at the same time
15:27 and
15:28 it's okay i didn't um i think i didn't
15:30 say it for now but uh
15:32 mate what was amazing is she actually
15:34 got her first programming job half like
15:37 just before we took on the internship
15:39 and if she had dropped out i couldn't
15:41 have done it but she kept going so that
15:44 we could pass it together um
15:46 yeah and i met akoja because i went to a
15:48 meetup so i think hopefully
15:51 touchwood now and it's looking like
15:54 meetups will start to be a little bit
15:55 more in person again it's a great way to
15:58 meet companies and
16:00 yeah that for me
16:01 meant there was like a bit of a personal
16:03 connection to talking to the developers
16:05 at kosher and kind of gave me also
16:07 insights for when i was applying about
16:09 what the company was about
16:13 so there is a question that i see how
16:15 did you get your first job in the
16:17 industry and i think you just answered
16:18 that
16:19 i don't know if internship counts as the
16:22 first job or not but i think the
16:24 experience is pretty much
16:26 a real industry experience but then as i
16:28 understood you stayed there as a
16:30 full-time employee after finishing the
16:32 internship right
16:34 so i didn't apply as an intern i um i
16:37 applied for like a mid-level back-end
16:39 position um
16:40 yes i got myself qualified for
16:44 um and they decided to create the
16:46 internship position for me i see
16:49 that's pretty cool
16:50 so you actually did do an internship
16:52 with them and it was like maybe i don't
16:54 know like some sort of a test period
16:56 right where they could see how you work
16:58 and then actually hire you as a
17:00 full-time
17:02 that's so that's cool so i guess one
17:04 take away from this is like don't be
17:06 don't afraid to
17:08 don't be afraid to apply to
17:11 jobs that you
17:12 don't seem to be qualified for right
17:15 yeah for the people who are listening
17:17 who are job hunting and for the people
17:18 who are listening in
17:20 companies
17:22 sometimes it's really worth taking the
17:23 risk of like
17:25 making space for folks to join
17:28 how did you convince them that they
17:31 actually should create internship for
17:32 you so how did you make this impression
17:34 this good impression on them
17:37 well
17:38 i mean this was their decision so i i
17:40 didn't suggest the internship so i don't
17:42 fully know um but for me i believe in it
17:46 was because i was uh showing a lot of
17:50 like
17:51 um inquisitiveness so the interview
17:54 process i found really hard they asked
17:57 me a lot of questions i just didn't know
17:59 the answer to about like networking
18:01 layers and i left the interview i was
18:03 like
18:04 balling my eyes out and i
18:06 i'm i'm pretty sure i'm not the only or
18:08 last person to go through that
18:10 but i think what i um tried to really
18:13 key into was reflecting the questions
18:16 back
18:17 um and kind of like showing it an
18:19 openness and willingness to try and pick
18:22 up on things and i think that worked a
18:24 lot in my favor because
18:25 for an intern and this would be the
18:27 biggest requirement um honestly like
18:30 they understand that you're not probably
18:33 gonna be contributing although i think i
18:36 contributed actually a bunch during my
18:38 internship
18:39 um but the focus for an intern should
18:42 really be like their development and
18:43 their learning so
18:45 i think you only want to go into that if
18:47 it's someone who
18:48 demonstrates that they're there to learn
18:52 networking layers is this oci
18:54 model
18:55 with seven layers
18:58 yeah it is like i i don't fully know it
19:00 so like i didn't learn much there
19:04 that's with physical level and then
19:05 there is like all the way up yeah i'm
19:08 not sure it probably has some practical
19:10 applications
19:15 yeah there's there's some good
19:16 understanding there in like
19:18 understanding exactly how the thing
19:20 you're building is being served to
19:22 to this but um
19:24 i honestly can say i've not used this
19:28 okay and then there is a follow-up
19:30 question from the same person at what
19:31 age but before you answer yeah you you
19:34 you don't have to answer that of course
19:35 but maybe it doesn't even matter at what
19:38 age you
19:39 do this because you said you changed
19:41 your career three times right um yeah
19:44 like at least in germany do you feel age
19:46 makes any difference when you
19:48 try to get into this junior dev position
19:52 um
19:54 yeah i mean i think age is the most a
19:56 thing in many industries
19:59 and not alone tech but also in tech um
20:02 so
20:02 i was
20:04 um 32 i think 32 33 when i was making
20:09 this transition so that was also part of
20:11 my reasoning is that i was like
20:13 out of the 20s where i felt i could do
20:15 anything and uh feeling like i needed a
20:18 proper job um
20:21 i
20:23 i'm not sure i specifically did hit any
20:26 barriers when it came to
20:28 my age
20:30 um
20:31 but i do think this is something that
20:33 some that folks do see
20:36 and i would say it's like also a real
20:38 concern like i've seen this question in
20:40 multiple times when i've talked with
20:42 folks in the community
20:44 um and
20:45 i can tell you also for myself i was
20:47 also nervous about this of like
20:50 is this a good time in my life to kind
20:52 of
20:53 um make this kind of change and decision
20:56 and of course it very much depends on
20:58 the individual's setup to
21:00 what the answer is um
21:02 to that question but
21:04 i would say overall
21:06 i didn't have a problem with this
21:08 personally
21:10 i think this question comes up in pretty
21:12 much every interview about career
21:14 changing that yeah we had here in a data
21:17 talks club maybe every second one but it
21:20 seems to be a popular
21:22 a common concern
21:24 i've seen the opposite also of folks
21:26 thinking um like if they're quite young
21:29 will they be taken seriously and i think
21:31 that's also a very valid concern um
21:34 something that i faced in my career when
21:37 i was younger
21:38 or younger let's say um bye
21:41 i hang out there good questions to ask
21:43 yourself but it's really going to depend
21:45 on your kind of like
21:48 more factors
21:49 um
21:50 i don't think i
21:52 kind of have come across a company where
21:53 they were like we don't want to hire you
21:55 because you're older um
22:01 yeah obviously they can't say it
22:02 directly but sometimes you know
22:09 another question from nelson and i think
22:11 this is also similar to a question i
22:13 prepared what are some of the challenges
22:16 that you faced during the beginning of
22:18 your career so what was the most
22:19 challenging thing for you
22:21 of things i'm
22:24 convincing myself that this was this was
22:26 a good decision and to keep going and to
22:28 not be stressed out as much like
22:31 of course i now wish i could look back
22:33 at myself and be like hey don't worry
22:35 chill it's gonna work out you can enjoy
22:37 some of this process and don't worry
22:40 like of course financial concerns i
22:43 was heavily supported by the government
22:44 and i'm fortunate that my partner also
22:46 was supporting me
22:48 but i was still like you know if i don't
22:50 get a job in six months how much longer
22:52 can i go on the money that i have and
22:55 you i think
22:57 this was really challenging of like
22:59 keeping yourself motivated and focused
23:01 on the goal
23:02 um a little bit of fear is
23:05 probably never a bad thing in general in
23:08 life but like not letting that overwhelm
23:10 you
23:11 so how did you keep yourself motivated
23:13 how did you keep yourself
23:16 you know
23:18 that you said like you weren't sure if
23:19 it's worth it so how did you convince
23:21 yourself that it was actually worth it
23:23 and you should
23:25 keep doing this
23:27 community community community
23:30 um i think being like going to meetups
23:33 which i i didn't wasn't familiar with
23:36 the concept when i started out right i
23:38 turned up at one and was like oh okay i
23:40 get to learn for free i get some pizza
23:42 and a beer while i'm doing it this is
23:44 amazing
23:45 um but also so much more than that like
23:48 being able to talk to people being able
23:49 to like listen into these kind of
23:51 conversations or ask questions
23:54 um and talk to other people who have
23:55 maybe recently done something similar to
23:57 what you want to do or even those that
23:59 are going through it right now
24:02 and you can really
24:03 bolster each other because i feel like
24:05 it's a lot easier to like speak up for
24:08 somebody else than sometimes it is for
24:10 yourself
24:11 so it's really great if you have other
24:13 folks who are at a similar point and you
24:15 can kind of like be there cheerleader
24:18 and they can be your cheerleader
24:21 yeah that's an interesting
24:23 thought i hear that also that it's
24:26 difficult to find a mentor so there are
24:29 a lot more meetings than mentors right
24:31 and the way you can solve this problem
24:34 is by
24:37 i don't know
24:38 like a few people of the senate who are
24:41 at the same level who they can just sit
24:43 together and form a master mind group
24:45 right mastermind is i don't know where
24:47 this term comes from but basically form
24:49 a group where everyone is at the same
24:51 level and everyone is kind of mentored
24:53 to each other
24:54 right and i think this is what you did
24:56 right
24:57 yeah and that's what the uh rail skull
24:59 summer of code that was their concept
25:01 that's why you had to do it in a pair
25:04 um
25:05 because that was that was really part of
25:07 the journey so like rt and me we had
25:09 very different backgrounds and
25:11 being in that situation together we
25:13 could understand each other a lot more
25:15 and even than
25:17 per se the coaches because once you've
25:19 also been in tech for a while
25:21 i feel like it's a little bit hard to
25:23 remember some of the challenges that you
25:25 faced
25:27 before you go into tech
25:29 it's very different
25:31 and um
25:33 did you also do this at with pie ladies
25:36 or mostly because you mentioned that you
25:38 can learn for free you can get some
25:39 pizza is it something that uh by ladies
25:42 also do like this uh community learning
25:44 events or it's more like a meet up when
25:46 you just attend and listen to talks
25:50 so maybe a good subway is talking about
25:52 um the role that i'm playing
25:54 with pi ladies um so very early on they
25:57 were asking apply ladies for folks to
25:59 help with organizing and of course i was
26:02 like well i've literally just learned
26:04 two lines of python i can't organize a
26:07 community group
26:09 well actually it turns out you can um so
26:11 a lot of the skill sets that are
26:12 required for organizing a community
26:14 group are
26:15 actually not related to coding and there
26:17 are a lot of the foundational skills
26:18 that we kind of actually also find
26:20 really desirable in software engineers
26:23 and normally put under the brackets soft
26:24 skills
26:26 but um
26:27 yeah i think it was a really strong move
26:30 to be honest to get involved in the
26:31 organizing because you kind of connect
26:33 in a different way to the community
26:36 group
26:36 and i'm not saying you have to become an
26:38 organizer to have that kind of
26:40 interaction but um i think it kind of
26:42 helps
26:43 so
26:44 at pi ladies we we run a number of
26:46 different like kind of
26:48 events um and we also have a global
26:51 slack
26:52 um very similar kind of i think to the
26:54 data talk slack where it's a place where
26:56 folks can help each other share learning
26:58 resources
27:00 um share job opportunities and kind of
27:02 reach out when they need support
27:05 and i think
27:07 you've got to find your community right
27:09 like
27:11 data talk club i really like the
27:12 community and i get a lot from it but
27:14 that might not be the community for
27:16 everybody pi ladies is the same um where
27:19 our group is open to everybody and
27:22 regardless of gender or background
27:25 our primary focus is on supporting
27:27 gender minorities in tech and in the
27:29 python community but we have folks in
27:32 the community that
27:33 don't even program with python and they
27:35 just like the community so you've got to
27:37 find a place that works for you i would
27:39 say
27:41 how did you fight your impostors
27:42 imposter syndrome so you just you said
27:45 that you learned your
27:47 first two lines of python code so that
27:50 i don't think you felt like you were
27:52 qualified to run a python group after
27:55 that
27:57 like how did you actually you said that
27:59 you know at the end you realize that
28:02 like it doesn't matter like the skills
28:04 you need to run a group
28:06 are very different from being
28:08 fluent in python right but how did you
28:10 convince yourself that
28:12 you got it that you can do this
28:16 i'm very stubborn person i think
28:20 um no i think i i really i really lean
28:23 into this idea of like it was to do with
28:25 having the support of the people
28:28 and voicing those concerns and other
28:30 people's uh voicing their concerns and
28:32 realizing i was not
28:34 not alone like
28:36 i remember being at meetups where they
28:38 were showing us like jupiter notebooks
28:40 which i i could imagine a lot of folks
28:43 in this community are quite familiar
28:44 with but i had never come across a
28:46 jupiter notebook and even getting it
28:48 running on my machine like take took me
28:51 essentially to hold me up um
28:54 and then i get in the ui and i'm like
28:56 i've no idea what this does and it was
28:58 that was it was really horrible
29:00 experience to be honest because i felt
29:02 very alone and
29:04 um pretty useless let's let's put it
29:06 that way so
29:08 i would also say though that i noticed
29:11 you know that experience was not
29:14 isolated like i'm not the only person
29:15 that has experienced that at the meet-up
29:17 so something i very much try to do
29:20 actively is
29:21 when i'm in a group try to see for the
29:23 signs if anybody is like
29:26 not so sure or not so comfortable with
29:28 what's going on and reach out to them um
29:30 and i think we could all do a bit more
29:32 of that because it helps a lot just to
29:34 know that you're not alone and like
29:38 trying to get this running on windows
29:39 and then trying to get it run on mac or
29:41 linux is
29:43 is difficult it's annoying even like
29:46 the most advanced engineers i kind of
29:48 hit these problems
29:50 did you need to run jupyter on windows
29:52 or on mac yes i bought a windows machine
29:55 because i thought that's what
29:56 programming was
29:59 and since then you got linux yeah i
30:01 remember it was also not easy for me as
30:03 well i was coming from java world to
30:06 python and
30:08 i had a windows computer as well but
30:10 then
30:11 it wasn't super easy like now it's
30:13 easier with anaconda but
30:16 like a while ago i don't know maybe you
30:18 were doing this four years ago i can
30:20 imagine that tools weren't the same as
30:22 now right
30:23 yeah and i mean even
30:26 i had i have used computers throughout
30:28 like
30:29 most of my life i mean yeah because i've
30:31 i've already told you my age so you kind
30:33 of can probably figure out that i wasn't
30:35 uh
30:36 as a child as a teenager we kind of like
30:38 started to get these interactions with
30:40 computers right and like
30:42 text editing and but i had i've never
30:44 really used the terminal for instance
30:46 and we we have folks joining the
30:48 community who you know even that level
30:50 of digital literacy i think is what i
30:52 would kind of call it
30:54 um
30:56 this is something that's like not i
30:58 think for younger folks today it's maybe
31:00 feels more natural because you know we
31:02 all kind of have mobile phones most of
31:04 us maybe have a computer of some sort
31:06 or access to one
31:08 but for a lot of folks that was kind of
31:10 not a given
31:14 yeah and interesting that you bring this
31:16 up about terminals
31:18 like an average
31:19 computer user even if they are
31:22 younger who started like who was born
31:26 and were growing up when computers were
31:29 around
31:30 i don't think they use terminal that
31:32 often and the reason i'm asking i'm
31:34 curious about that it's as an instructor
31:37 of
31:37 machine learning zoom comp and data
31:39 engineering zoom comp i see that many
31:41 people even those who already have
31:42 experience let's say in data science
31:45 they are not very comfortable in the
31:47 terminal
31:49 so for me it was natural
31:51 uh i just didn't even think that for
31:53 some people it's uh you know something
31:55 outside of the comfort zone comfort zone
31:57 so how did
31:58 you how did you i don't know learn to
32:01 use it let's say
32:04 i i think there are a few nice courses i
32:06 think code academy again also offered i
32:08 didn't know anything
32:11 yeah i did some courses on this for sure
32:13 and um
32:16 yeah i think the only thing with doing
32:17 it in a browser-based tool is you're not
32:18 actually on your machine
32:20 so i remember during the rails girls
32:22 summer of code i wanted to dual boot my
32:24 machine into linux because it became
32:26 apparent to me that um
32:28 being the person at the meet up with
32:30 windows wasn't always the most fun
32:32 um and i knew that like a lot of the
32:35 places that i had kind of heard about
32:37 that had jobs also didn't work with
32:40 window machines so i thought okay i'm
32:41 gonna dual boot into linux
32:43 um and
32:45 i don't know how many folks have done
32:47 this but
32:49 my goodness at some point my machine
32:50 just wasn't really turning on anymore
32:52 and i had to get someone to help me who
32:54 then got into the main terminal and like
32:57 as we was able to run all of these
32:59 commands and kind of watching learning
33:01 by doing or learning by having to do
33:04 because uh otherwise you have no
33:06 computer
33:13 to linux and then something will go
33:15 wrong and you have no choice but to
33:16 figure out how it works right
33:19 pretty much
33:21 and then in terminal actually like i
33:23 also had this situation where
33:25 the
33:26 graphical interface wouldn't load so the
33:28 only thing i had was terminal
33:30 yeah
33:31 actually there are terminal based
33:32 browsers so one of them is called links
33:35 and i was able to use it for google and
33:37 stuff that was fun
33:41 and then of course there is there are
33:42 things like men
33:44 that might know that like you know the
33:46 old way of getting help instead of
33:49 looking up something in the search
33:50 engine but you know just using uh
33:53 manuals on your computer terminal
33:55 manuals yeah
33:57 yeah i mainly just looked up on my phone
33:59 and then was like okay this command i
34:03 also i wasn't very wise to the fact that
34:05 you maybe shouldn't just run any random
34:07 command you find on line on your
34:09 computer but uh generally it worked out
34:11 fine
34:13 and yeah coming back to pay ladies so
34:16 what kind of events do you actually
34:17 organize so i know one which is a meet
34:19 up like after work like the physical
34:21 meet up of my meetup or after work there
34:24 are speakers you
34:26 watch the talk you're the dogs and then
34:28 there is some networking i don't know
34:29 before and after is it the only type of
34:31 event you organize so there are others
34:36 um so
34:39 previously like before the pandemic
34:41 let's say uh we were predominantly
34:43 running every month this kind of event
34:45 that you just described and really
34:47 encouraging our members to give talks
34:49 and share knowledge but also we would
34:50 invite folks in and we would normally be
34:52 hosted by a different company every time
34:54 so you also had the chance to kind of
34:56 network and meet
34:57 me companies and we started to do some
35:00 like weekend day events and we were
35:03 trying to run stuff that would be more
35:05 beginner friendly we were trying to run
35:07 some um
35:08 events that were essentially for what we
35:10 just talked about of like how do i even
35:12 install python on my machine um how do i
35:15 set up github um because you need those
35:17 steps really to kind of join a lot of
35:20 the workshops um that are then run
35:24 by the by the community
35:26 um
35:27 and we had also been involved in a few
35:29 conferences doing like panel discussions
35:32 and kind of uh
35:34 kind of doing collaborations with other
35:35 meetup groups the pandemic changed a lot
35:38 so first of all of course we could not
35:40 be in person so we started to do things
35:42 remotely um we've experimented with a
35:45 few different tools um we've been using
35:48 gather town for a kind of more like
35:50 brainstorming events where we help folks
35:52 write their and
35:54 call for paper application
35:56 i'm so shortened it's called cfp and
35:58 that's if you want to be a talk a
36:00 speaker at a conference you need to
36:01 submit something like this with a
36:03 abstract and a bio so we wanted to help
36:05 folks
36:06 kind of figure out doing that
36:08 that's the most
36:10 applying for a conference yeah
36:13 well actually we ran one in january and
36:15 i think we had at least
36:18 three folks from that event then go on
36:20 to speak at pycon de um which is
36:25 which is really awesome
36:26 um but right now we're trying to
36:28 experiment a lot more with being much
36:31 more transparent with how we organize
36:33 and also making it easier for other
36:35 community members to organize so we're
36:37 really open for anything we have
36:39 currently
36:40 some study groups going on every month
36:42 for data structures and algorithms
36:46 um
36:47 yeah sure predominantly
36:49 we're writing that in python but to be
36:51 honest you can join regardless of the
36:52 language and we are also doing an open
36:56 source hack evening the next one is
36:58 actually on tuesday
37:00 this is in person so it's a limited
37:03 attendance
37:04 but that's an opportunity to get started
37:07 working on an open source project and we
37:08 have some mentors there from like skype
37:11 scikit-learn
37:13 um and jean ai
37:16 yeah
37:17 and
37:18 this hack evenings are offline events
37:20 but these study groups are online or
37:22 also offline
37:24 the study groups are currently
37:26 online
37:27 and the hack evenings are offline and
37:29 the talk evenings are currently online
37:31 too and we stream them similar i think
37:34 to you like on youtube um we'd love to
37:36 do a hybrid
37:38 because we found during the pandemic um
37:40 and i'm not sure how this was i don't
37:43 know if you've always done your things
37:44 online um
37:46 i can't imagine it must be very
37:48 difficult to first find a venue than uh
37:52 i don't know
37:53 like uh
37:56 i think there are a lot of like a lot
37:58 more overhead right now you i don't know
38:00 get food or things like this
38:02 i
38:08 it's interesting i think there's
38:09 different overhead with online um
38:12 but what we would love to do is hybrid
38:14 so we would love to like we found being
38:15 remote allowed us to reach more people
38:18 um
38:19 because we could also do collaboration
38:21 with other chapters in germany so pi
38:23 ladies is a global organization
38:26 and um there's four chapter
38:28 i think actually a fifth one just
38:30 got created during piconde
38:33 uh in cologne
38:34 so
38:36 being online had a lot of benefits and i
38:38 think moving forwards it would be really
38:40 nice to offer like more of a hybrid
38:41 approach but i do know that a lot of
38:43 folks in the community really value the
38:45 in-person events
38:47 and
38:48 for some things for sure like i feel
38:50 like especially if you have someone who
38:53 is not so
38:54 like familiar with the terminal or how
38:56 the computer is set up
38:58 it can really help to be kind of like in
39:00 the same room next to them um to go
39:02 through that
39:04 because like if it's streamed to youtube
39:06 like this one right
39:08 it's only
39:09 you know
39:10 it's only one directional you cannot
39:13 raise the hand and ask a question of
39:15 course you can write in live chat but
39:16 it's very difficult to help through live
39:19 chat
39:20 so how can people if somebody wants to
39:23 take part in your events where do they
39:26 find them is it on meet up by ladies
39:28 berlin or there's another place
39:31 yeah exactly meet up
39:33 pilotes berlin is the best place there's
39:35 also then a link into our slack um and
39:38 the global slack is kind of where we
39:40 mostly promote things that we're doing
39:44 i think you mentioned
39:46 that a bit how did you find them or how
39:49 did
39:50 they find you
39:53 up by ladies like how did you start
39:55 working with them like how did you start
39:57 trying in the group
39:59 yeah it's a really good question i
40:01 actually um
40:03 i'm not sure if i remember fully sorry i
40:05 realized my battery is like
40:07 on zero so i'm just kind of making sure
40:09 that it gets plugged in um
40:14 i think i just came across me up
40:16 and i i knew that python was something
40:19 that i would probably be that i wanted
40:21 to kind of invest in because um
40:24 it's got very a lot of applications and
40:27 i kind of already had this concept of
40:28 being interested in the data science
40:31 field although that's actually just to
40:32 be clear not the field that i work in
40:35 um
40:37 yeah
40:39 and they were advertising for organizers
40:41 during the meetup so
40:43 okay so they just ask hey does anyone
40:45 want to
40:46 organize this and you thought okay maybe
40:48 that would be me
40:50 yeah
40:51 that
40:53 i'm i am that kind of person so yes but
40:56 uh
40:57 you know i think like there's a lot of
40:58 benefits to being involved in organizing
41:00 as i mentioned before
41:02 um
41:03 not just like the networking with other
41:05 members but also the element of like
41:07 meeting companies so i've been to lots
41:09 of companies and talked to them
41:12 and i can tell you it's kind of
41:15 a different conversation to when you're
41:16 going there and just being like hey i
41:18 want a job sorry i think that's really
41:20 great it also kind of
41:22 helps you build um
41:25 like i think we're gonna also talk a
41:26 little bit about public speaking but it
41:27 also really helps you kind of get
41:29 comfortable also in this area
41:31 um and i i personally find it really
41:34 rewarding uh working with others and
41:37 like seeing their successes as well is
41:39 is really cool and
41:41 i think that's why i mentioned earlier
41:43 it like really feeds back into these
41:44 foundational skills
41:46 which if you're interested in going into
41:48 like a management role
41:50 uh at some point in your career
41:53 are the kind of skills that um you would
41:55 have to build up so
41:59 and
42:00 before running this events i had no idea
42:03 how actually how difficult organizing
42:05 these things are
42:07 so yeah
42:10 so i imagine that how this can be useful
42:13 at work for of course non-technical
42:15 topics but let's say you want to
42:16 organize something at work and then all
42:18 of a sudden you have all the skills that
42:20 you need for that
42:21 right or like how the team should work
42:24 like what do they need and then
42:26 you already have this i don't know if
42:28 it's right
42:29 it's correct to call it
42:30 project management kind of things but
42:34 you know like organizing things
42:37 i mean i remember helping to organize
42:39 one of the off sites for our dev team
42:42 and the cto was like you might have set
42:44 the bar a little high now
42:48 so
42:48 yeah it does it does but then you don't
42:50 want to get stuck only doing that work
42:53 yeah i imagine
42:55 so you mentioned public speaking and
42:57 this is something we indeed wanted to
42:59 talk about
43:00 so i know that you
43:02 are quite
43:04 an active speaker and you mentioned that
43:06 you spoke at
43:08 you gave a presentation or what was it
43:10 the lightning talk it doesn't matter
43:12 before even
43:14 getting into it you already gave a talk
43:16 on an id conference
43:19 and
43:21 yeah so
43:22 i wanted to ask you here again related
43:25 to
43:26 how did you organize how did you feel
43:28 like
43:29 you can organize uh run at community
43:32 when you don't know much about the
43:33 technology so here as well so how did
43:36 you convince yourself that you can
43:38 actually give a talk even though you're
43:40 just starting
43:46 yeah i mean i think
43:49 we
43:49 i
43:50 think most people even people who i
43:53 spoke to that i felt were like really
43:55 proficient speakers also have um
43:59 nerves and this kind of what we call
44:00 imposter syndrome of feeling like we
44:03 don't have anything to add to the
44:05 conversation or
44:06 um it's not something that we
44:09 have the ability to do um and i i
44:11 definitely
44:13 have i continue to feel this like
44:15 actually recently and i'm
44:17 gonna say this is like uh you know i
44:20 think you have to celebrate your wins
44:21 but recently i've been asked to give a
44:23 keynote at pycon italia
44:25 um which
44:27 honestly i'm still that's cool wondering
44:31 why
44:32 they asked me but like you have to
44:34 celebrate your wins and then i you know
44:37 my initial response was just to say oh
44:38 no sorry i can't do it um
44:41 but then i was like
44:43 don't talk yourself out of this
44:45 opportunity so a lot of the time i think
44:47 we are our own worst enemies and kind of
44:50 really holding ourselves back um
44:53 so i think
44:55 the first talk i gave
44:58 after i had like transitioned into tech
45:00 was at the next cloud conference so
45:03 nexcloud is the open source
45:05 um software that i worked on with the
45:08 rails gold summer of code
45:09 and and they have a conference and i
45:12 gave a small talk there about um git
45:15 commands that i had learned and kind of
45:19 had fun
45:20 finding various wizard of odd characters
45:22 and aligning them with the different gig
45:24 commands
45:26 and i think that's a good way is to get
45:28 started with a smaller group that you're
45:31 more comfortable with
45:32 um so the contributor conference um i
45:35 mean it wasn't tiny but it's like
45:37 not a huge conference and it was
45:40 predominantly people that i kind of
45:41 already knew
45:43 um and i think yeah speaking at meetups
45:45 is also a really good way to do this
45:47 um
45:49 because then you can get a feel for how
45:51 you what topics you also want to talk
45:54 about
45:55 and um also like how you want to present
45:57 them i feel like this is something i'm
45:59 also still learning a lot but i've also
46:01 realized there's some topics i don't
46:03 want to talk about that i just
46:06 i feel like i have a lot to say or like
46:08 they don't interest me as much and
46:10 um i think i had to go through this
46:12 process of doing a lot of speaking to
46:15 actually get to that point
46:18 and i imagine let's say you just learned
46:20 git commands or i don't know if that was
46:22 the case when you gave that talk about
46:23 git commands but let's say you learned
46:25 them two months ago and now like how do
46:28 you actually convince yourself that
46:31 i know enough of this
46:33 not to embarrass myself when i talk
46:36 about these things because you know
46:38 things can go wrong
46:40 always even for experienced speakers
46:42 live demos will go wrong
46:44 like so how do you convince yourself
46:46 that it's okay
46:48 uh to do this
46:51 i think the fear is what happens when
46:53 that person at the end puts their hand
46:55 up and asks me a question
46:56 i don't know the answer to and i've put
46:58 myself in this position of expert
47:01 um
47:02 and
47:03 i've given talks where people put their
47:05 hand up at the end and ask that question
47:06 i didn't know the answer to and felt
47:08 embarrassed because i felt like i
47:10 positioned myself and
47:12 as an expert i think
47:15 this is
47:16 obviously um
47:18 totally understandable that people would
47:20 feel this way
47:21 the thing
47:22 is when you're giving a talk on a topic
47:26 actually you know the expectation is
47:29 not that you know everything about it
47:31 like
47:32 especially if it's a broad topic right
47:34 so get i talked about specific gig
47:36 commands that i had recently learned and
47:39 got familiar with but if someone had
47:40 asked me about a different gate command
47:42 i just wouldn't have known like there is
47:44 a certain breadth of the topic that you
47:46 just can't cover
47:48 um i think also it's like why are you
47:50 giving the talk right what is what is
47:52 the kind of like personal edge on this
47:55 and that is something that
47:57 no one is more expert on than yourself
48:00 so um if it's your experience so for me
48:03 i was talking also not just about the
48:05 gate commands
48:06 in a way of like oh here's some git
48:08 commands you can learn but also like my
48:10 experience of having to learn those git
48:12 commands and my feeling towards them
48:14 so if you can put your torque in this
48:16 angle
48:18 then
48:19 you should feel confident because this
48:21 is this is this is the added layer of
48:23 personality that only you can add
48:25 and no one else is an expert on that
48:27 than yourself
48:28 so i think it's it's totally fine to
48:30 feel that fearful but um also there's
48:33 really good techniques that i've learned
48:34 from watching other speakers
48:36 of how to kind of gracefully
48:39 say i don't know
48:41 um
48:42 so how to gratefully say i don't know
48:45 rather
48:46 apart from you know just being up front
48:47 and saying
48:48 sorry i don't know all that
48:51 um i mean it's also totally fine to just
48:53 be like hey i don't know uh that um i
48:56 think one thing you can do is see it as
48:58 an opportunity to learn so you can say
49:00 hey that's a really interesting point
49:02 that you raised and i'd love to talk to
49:04 you more about it
49:05 and so you kind of you know you don't
49:08 have to on the spot have an answer you
49:10 might also it might be something that
49:11 you think you can answer but not
49:13 immediately and you can say hey i need
49:15 some time to think about that come find
49:16 me after the talk and we can talk about
49:18 it further
49:19 um but yeah i mean if someone asks you
49:21 something and you don't know like
49:23 actually that also happened to me where
49:25 someone came and was
49:26 um asking me about my talk and i was
49:29 talking about um
49:32 this
49:32 big o notation in algorithms and like
49:36 and different algorithms implementations
49:38 in python and i think i had made a small
49:40 error in one of my slides and someone
49:42 came and spoke to me about that at the
49:43 end so that was great it was a learning
49:45 opportunity for me too
49:48 after the talk right not uh during the q
49:51 a
49:53 yeah yeah i think there's definitely a
49:54 lot to be said for
49:57 for this if you're the person asking
49:59 questions like yeah be mindful and if
50:02 you're giving feedback also be mindful
50:04 of how you deliver feedback um like even
50:07 in the pycon i heard about some folks
50:09 just kind of
50:11 going up to speakers and being like i
50:13 just disagree with you but like not
50:15 really constructively saying why and it
50:17 it's totally fine to have your opinion
50:19 on something um
50:21 but also when it's a subjective comment
50:23 a subjective topic maybe also think
50:26 about like what real
50:27 worth your comment adds to that
50:32 yeah so how helpful
50:33 this speaking in public public speaking
50:36 was for your career
50:38 did it help you land uh you know a job
50:41 or broaden your
50:43 network
50:46 i think it's really useful and i think
50:48 it's very beneficial so i really do i
50:51 don't think it's for everybody you
50:52 obviously
50:54 first of all have to feel comfortable
50:55 with it and it has to be something that
50:57 you would like to do
50:58 um but i think the visibility it brings
51:00 you is actually
51:02 quite useful you get first of all you
51:03 get to be invited on an awesome podcast
51:06 or
51:07 like this kind of thing and talk to
51:08 alexis so why would you not want to do
51:10 it
51:11 um but i think also it does broaden your
51:14 network and
51:15 so far i haven't i haven't changed jobs
51:18 so i haven't really
51:19 um
51:21 looked at it in this way although i have
51:22 had job offers after i've given talks
51:25 um i've also spoken to people who then
51:28 want to work at a closure so i've helped
51:30 the company that i work for i have some
51:33 sort of brand recognition in the tech
51:35 industry and and indirectly then get
51:37 maybe get hired at the company so
51:40 i think there's a lot of pluses and um
51:43 you know i think
51:45 we need more representation also like
51:47 there's a lot of conferences that have
51:49 um you know a very good selection of
51:52 speakers but they don't have a lot of
51:54 like different speakers and as i
51:56 mentioned before it's this personal
51:58 layer of a topic that i think
52:00 adds the interest so
52:02 um one thing that we'd like to do at pi
52:03 ladies is really support more people not
52:05 just to talk at our meetup groups
52:08 but then also talk at other uh platforms
52:11 and conferences and you know some folks
52:14 get paid for this from somebody
52:16 to data talks club we are always looking
52:18 for guests and speakers i
52:21 absolutely have a few people for you
52:24 um do you have any tips
52:26 regarding public speaking like if
52:28 somebody wants to
52:29 improve their public speaking speakers
52:31 public speaking skills or i don't know
52:34 just get started do you have any tips or
52:36 suggestions
52:38 yeah i would and
52:39 maybe start small like so start with
52:42 like a 10 minute talk there's a great
52:44 conference called python pizza all the
52:46 talks are 10 minutes
52:48 um so you you know not that 10-minute
52:51 talk is easy but don't get me wrong i
52:53 think crafting a 10-minute talk
52:56 yeah in some ways it's more difficult
52:58 yeah exactly
52:59 but i think also you can be a bit more
53:01 contained and like and try not to cover
53:04 too broader topic like be more specific
53:07 really think about this personal element
53:09 of like what why you're giving the talk
53:11 okay so like
53:13 it's great if you want to talk about
53:14 like a docker compose or you know um
53:17 some
53:18 new library but
53:20 what's your connection to that why why
53:22 are people turning up to listen to you
53:24 talk about that
53:25 and i think also and do some dry runs so
53:28 something we do with pi ladies is when
53:30 we have speakers we normally do a dry
53:32 run which means that they present the
53:34 talk maybe not even in a finished state
53:37 to a couple of the organizers
53:40 and we give feedback and i think this is
53:42 this is a great way to refine um i
53:44 haven't done many talks that i've given
53:46 over and over again
53:48 uh but i hear folks also kind of
53:51 do this to have you have you done that
53:53 where you've talked and then you've gone
53:54 under the same talk somewhere else
53:57 yeah i did a couple of times
53:59 um usually people just there was uh i
54:02 gave a token by uh
54:05 by data berlin
54:07 before pandemic and then somebody saw
54:09 the talk and said hey do you want to
54:10 give the same talk in our conference
54:13 i said yeah of course
54:15 but then sadly um sadly pandemic
54:18 happened so i couldn't travel to
54:20 bucharest i wanted to travel to
54:21 bucharest
54:22 so i had to do it
54:24 online but that's still okay
54:27 and and was that a useful experience
54:29 then for like refining the material
54:33 yeah and also i think for me personally
54:35 i
54:36 usually try to give the same talk at
54:38 work before going to a conference so
54:40 this is like a driver
54:42 yeah yeah that's true yeah that's a
54:44 great idea conferences like i can't
54:46 imagine like when you go and give that
54:48 keynote in pycon uh italia italy
54:53 there must be a lot of people
54:56 watching you
54:57 like oh yeah yeah you're not making me
54:59 nervous at all
55:04 yeah i mean
55:07 that it's definitely no freaking like i
55:08 think being on the stage at go-to that's
55:11 a big stage in that bcc hall
55:14 is a huge
55:15 stage and even though there wasn't like
55:17 a huge amount of people attending
55:20 that is a different experience to maybe
55:22 having done it during the pandemic and
55:24 being on zoom calls and talking like
55:27 indeed
55:28 it's too edged i like the interaction
55:30 with the audience that you get if you do
55:31 it in person you don't really get that
55:34 online
55:35 yeah i see that we don't have a lot of
55:37 time left and i really wanted to talk to
55:39 you about the company where i work
55:41 ecosia i hope i pronounce it correctly
55:44 and i know that you're doing some
55:46 amazing stuff there so can you tell us
55:49 more about that
55:51 i will give you a very quick overview so
55:54 um
55:55 yeah akosha is a search engine just like
55:59 google or go any of your preferences um
56:02 but we're putting our profits into tree
56:05 planting because we believe that this is
56:07 the most significant way and to have an
56:09 impact on the changing climate in in a
56:12 positive way so
56:14 um the company model essentially works
56:16 like any search engine when you make
56:18 searches some of the results are ads and
56:21 when you click on the ads we earn some
56:23 revenue and um essentially we are we're
56:26 very transparent with our financials um
56:28 but we put our profits into tree
56:30 planting instead of like into investors
56:32 pockets and of course
56:35 this is the profits right after we've
56:36 paid all of our bills and
56:38 uh have some for growth and so forth
56:42 um
56:42 right now i think it's at 54
56:45 of our revenue and that's something
56:47 that's like one of our real goals is to
56:49 like have a like be earning more revenue
56:51 so we can put more into the tree
56:53 planning
56:54 um
56:56 we the work there for me right now is
56:59 mainly uh like back end engineering work
57:01 so we have we work with like
57:03 microservices and the microservices
57:05 actually are predominantly written in go
57:08 um golang
57:09 so um i don't i didn't write as much
57:12 python for most of the time that i've
57:14 been working there but recently i kind
57:16 of moved over a little bit into a new
57:18 team that's working on um adding more
57:22 green information on the search results
57:24 and and we've kind of had a few projects
57:27 ongoing but we started to do a little
57:28 bit of like intent recognition
57:31 i'm also working with some of the
57:33 universities here in berlin
57:36 so yeah this was my big hope for
57:39 the machine learning zoom cam which was
57:41 just amazing i will say again uh was to
57:43 try and apply a few more of those skills
57:46 into
57:48 my day-to-day work um unfortunately it's
57:50 not quite worked out that way as much as
57:53 i would have liked i will be honest um
57:55 but i think having that base and being
57:58 the person i am i will still continue to
58:00 advocate to kind of
58:02 yeah use these resources and and see how
58:06 it can like improve our product and help
58:08 us plant more trees
58:10 yeah great
58:11 um before we finish there is one
58:13 question with three quotes maybe we can
58:15 cover that quickly
58:17 so
58:17 the question is did you face any
58:19 discrimination for being a woman in tech
58:22 it is said that tech bros can be pretty
58:25 annoying
58:28 um
58:30 it's an interesting way of phrasing the
58:31 question sorry that's why i'm laughing
58:32 uh yeah i mean like
58:34 let's be real there is definitely a
58:37 gender imbalance in tech
58:39 uh not only in tech i mean the other
58:42 industries that worked in film and
58:43 television and coffee
58:45 equally i have this problem
58:47 um and i mean yeah i think being a woman
58:50 is one axis of that but if you also fall
58:54 into some of the other marginalized
58:55 groups in tech you're also certainly
58:57 probably gonna face a lot more problems
58:59 than i did
59:00 um i think being a native english
59:02 speaker
59:03 i had a lot of privilege there in terms
59:05 of the fact that tech in berlin is
59:07 predominantly an english-speaking world
59:10 um so i know a lot of folks in the
59:11 community where
59:13 this is a barrier
59:15 that they face
59:16 um
59:17 i think
59:18 there is an underlying um sexism in our
59:22 society so of course that exists in tech
59:25 as well
59:26 and i
59:28 definitely feel like the tech industry
59:30 has enough resources to start doing more
59:32 about this and not just sexism but like
59:36 all the different intersections of
59:38 discrimination
59:39 and marginalization that happens so i'm
59:42 very hopeful that this is a space where
59:44 we can really make an impact and i'm
59:46 always open if people have ideas of how
59:48 we can do more to do so
59:52 yeah thanks
59:54 so before we finish
59:56 how can people find you sleepy pioneer
59:59 uh in twitter right that's the way to my
1:00:02 twitter and github
