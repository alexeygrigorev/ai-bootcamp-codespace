1:35 science Career Development development
1:37 we have a special guest today Katie
1:39 Katie do I plant it correctly kitty it's
1:43 fine yeah Katie Katie Bauer yeah hi
1:46 Katie so Katie is a data science leader
1:48 known her for writing and thinking about
1:51 data career and managing effective data
1:53 teams so she is currently the head of
1:55 data at close
1:57 close genius leading from another tongue
2:01 twister
2:03 leading software platforms for beauty
2:06 Professionals in the U.S cellular and
2:09 Studio space so previously led to this
2:12 infrastructure team and analytics
2:14 organizations
2:16 I think he also worked in Twitter at
2:18 Twitter and uh yeah and a bunch of other
2:20 places as well yeah welcome
2:23 yeah thank you for having me very
2:25 excited about this conversation today
2:27 so before we go into our main topic of
2:30 developing data science career
2:34 let's start with your background can you
2:36 tell us about your career Journey so far
2:39 sure
2:40 um like a lot of people who ended up
2:42 working in data science in the early 20
2:44 teens I originally got into the field
2:48 because I was looking for a way to not
2:50 have an academic career I I was going to
2:54 be a linguist for a while and then
2:57 decided that I would rather do something
2:59 different for a little bit I thought
3:00 maybe I would go back but I
3:03 ended up not doing it
3:05 um I I came out to the Bay Area after
3:07 finishing school to work in Tech and the
3:10 the role I ended up in ended up being
3:12 very data Centric and over time I just
3:15 kind of became an all-purpose state of
3:17 person
3:18 um I started off as a business analyst
3:20 did a lot of report building and
3:22 automation
3:24 improve my coding skills and eventually
3:26 became a data scientist I worked on
3:28 production ad targeting algorithms and
3:31 then eventually made my way over to
3:32 social media for a large part of my
3:35 career I was one of the first data
3:37 scientists at Reddit I was there for a
3:39 long time as an individual contributor
3:41 and eventually became a manager working
3:43 mostly on consumer product concerns
3:46 there
3:47 and then I eventually moved over to
3:50 Twitter where I ran a small organization
3:52 focused on the infrastructure
3:54 organization and really kind of
3:55 measuring the ROI on the company's
3:57 technology decisions
4:00 um throughout all of that I have been
4:02 very uh
4:03 self-reflective I guess spends a lot of
4:06 time thinking about careers and all the
4:08 different forms and shapes they they can
4:09 take and I've watched my peers uh make a
4:13 lot of choices that were different for
4:14 me as well and um I have really come to
4:17 believe that data is its own distinct
4:21 career path and it has a lot of
4:22 different ways in and a lot of different
4:24 ways out that are are unique to it you
4:26 don't really see the same sorts of
4:28 things in like PM careers or software
4:30 engineering careers
4:32 and right now you're not in social media
4:35 anymore
4:38 close genius is not in social media
4:41 no
4:42 um it's a b SAS company
4:45 um sort of a mixture of B2B SAS and and
4:47 payments um it is software that helps
4:51 individual
4:52 um and I guess now teams uh salon owners
4:55 to run their business so it does a lot
4:57 of back office stuff helps them manage
4:59 appointments and schedules take payments
5:01 uh it's something that really allows
5:03 them to focus on kind of the Artistry of
5:06 what they do and not have to worry about
5:07 sort of the the admin it's something
5:10 that actually gets people a lot of
5:11 social Mobility too so it's a really
5:13 good company from a social standpoint
5:15 it's interesting to see how this SAS
5:17 businesses develop so there are some
5:20 very generic software uh but it's not
5:23 really well tailored to the needs of you
5:26 know a specific Niche like beauty salons
5:28 right so then there is uh there are
5:31 companies like yours uh appear and help
5:33 in this industry but that's really cool
5:35 and what do you do there as a head of
5:38 its head of data right yeah uh that is
5:42 my title the head of data um broadly my
5:45 job is making sure that the company is
5:47 getting the most out of its data data is
5:50 a strategically valuable asset and it's
5:52 something that can both be used to
5:54 improve the operation of the company and
5:56 also to potentially deliver value
5:58 directly to the company's customers
6:01 um right now I am in the process of
6:03 building a best-in-class data team I am
6:05 hiring so if anyone is interested in
6:07 coming to work for this company you
6:09 should let me know uh but the the main
6:11 focus right now is really kind of
6:12 getting the team stood up maturing our
6:15 operations and then figuring out how we
6:17 we grow and scale and make gloss genius
6:20 a better company
6:21 who are you hiring what kind of roles
6:25 uh product analysts marketing scientists
6:27 and analysts and analytics Engineers so
6:29 lots of different things
6:31 was it Halloween I you set them quite
6:35 fast
6:36 so product analysts I hear I I
6:39 understood product analysts and
6:41 analytics engineers and marketers
6:43 marketing analyst right yeah someone
6:46 who's going to mostly work on data
6:48 problems related to marketing and go to
6:50 market but statistical skills are
6:53 especially important in that role for
6:55 anyone who's involved in the space
6:58 attribution has gotten more complicated
7:00 over the past couple of years because of
7:02 iOS tracking changes so uh we did we
7:05 definitely need someone with good
7:06 statistical chops for that role you
7:08 don't have any data scientists yet
7:11 yeah uh we're not using that title for
7:13 now now um I mean this is something that
7:16 I could go on about but what exactly
7:19 data scientists mean is always an
7:21 interesting question
7:22 so what does it mean to you
7:26 for me it's a bit more like a term like
7:28 software engineer it's kind of a broad
7:31 cover term that can describe a lot of
7:33 different roles I mean I've had data
7:35 science in my title for most of my
7:37 career and it's been completely
7:38 different at every company I've worked
7:40 for
7:41 um at one point I was productionizing ml
7:43 algorithms I have done what a lot of
7:45 people call analyst work under that
7:47 title I have written beta pipelines and
7:49 done a lot of data engineering under
7:50 that title
7:52 um to me it's it's more of a description
7:54 of a broad category of things and it
7:56 gives you a good idea of what someone is
7:58 not doing but it doesn't necessarily
8:00 tell you the specifics a lot of times
8:02 you have to get that more contextually
8:03 from understanding the company it's
8:05 maturity the stage of the team uh there
8:09 are a lot of other things that give you
8:10 better ideas of what specifically you
8:12 will be doing
8:13 there's already a question how do we
8:16 apply for a role in your company I guess
8:18 you have a careers page right we do
8:22 um if you Google I guess squash seniors
8:24 careers you'll you'll probably find it
8:26 um you can also send me a message on
8:27 Twitter
8:28 um or you can send me a DM on LinkedIn
8:32 okay yeah so what do you usually well we
8:36 just talked about data scientists and uh
8:38 you said that this is quite an um
8:42 ambiguous term it can mean anything or
8:44 maybe not ambiguous but broad you said
8:47 broad like it can mean anything and it
8:49 usually describes what people don't do
8:52 rather than what they do but what do
8:54 data science managers do in this case
8:57 um yeah that that is a very good
9:00 question
9:01 um in some ways being a data science
9:02 manager is not that different from being
9:05 a manager for a technical role of any
9:07 sort
9:08 um you're you're kind of responsible for
9:09 building a team that is able to meet
9:12 your organization's needs and solve
9:14 certain types of problems
9:16 um so like a lot of advice that you hear
9:19 for engineering managers
9:21 can apply to data science management or
9:23 data management analytics management
9:25 whatever term you want to use I'm
9:26 probably going to use the term data
9:27 science management for the rest of this
9:28 conversation
9:30 um but like there are particular aspects
9:33 of the way data teams are organized and
9:36 the way people add value as data
9:39 scientists that mean you have to
9:40 approach things differently as a data
9:43 science manager
9:44 one of those is that I I think like one
9:47 of the biggest constraints really for
9:48 people who are running data science
9:50 teams is that the details in the domain
9:53 context matter a ton it is really hard
9:56 to give good specific advice to a
10:00 cross-functional person if you don't
10:01 really understand their domain or if
10:04 you're a manager like it's really hard
10:05 to give someone good specific feedback
10:07 on their work if you're not familiar
10:09 with the domain
10:10 so that is a constraint that I think
10:14 impacts data science teams more than
10:16 almost any other type of technical team
10:19 you usually have to know the business
10:21 you need to have good context for how
10:23 things work how the company makes money
10:25 what you need users to do to make money
10:29 um and that ends up creating an unusual
10:30 structure on data teams uh where you
10:33 have what is often referred to as an
10:34 embedded model
10:36 um where someone on your data team will
10:39 like they might report to a data science
10:41 manager or some other kind of data
10:43 leader uh but their day-to-day decisions
10:46 are very informed by who they're working
10:49 with cross-functionally so you may have
10:51 analysts or data scientists go sit with
10:54 a product team and essentially be a part
10:56 of that team like a lot of what they do
10:59 day to day is determined by a dotted
11:02 line manager so that's someone who is
11:05 probably a product manager or an
11:07 engineering manager or like a person in
11:09 marketing or something who assigns them
11:12 tasks
11:14 um or helps negotiate tasks with them
11:16 and then the data science manager is
11:19 someone who's broadly responsible for
11:21 the quality of the craft of data science
11:23 and the career growth of a data
11:26 scientist uh another term for this that
11:29 you hear a lot is a matrix organization
11:31 where you have essentially a horizontal
11:34 team that then goes and sits with
11:38 certain certain verticals
11:40 another complicated part of this is that
11:43 if you are a data science manager whose
11:45 team
11:46 spans many verticals it can be kind of
11:49 hard for you to to know all the details
11:51 of what everyone is doing
11:53 but that is
11:56 there are ways of getting around then I
11:57 suppose
11:58 so in summary so we have usually let's
12:01 say there is a data scientist or just a
12:03 data professional embedded in the team
12:06 so you mentioned this Matrix structure
12:08 where this person has a data leader data
12:13 science manager right and then there is
12:14 a dotted line some other manager usually
12:17 a product manager or engineering manager
12:19 and the role of a data leader data
12:22 science manager is helped with the
12:25 quality of the craft and career growth
12:27 so I think we will probably spend most
12:30 of the of the interview today talking
12:32 about career growth but before that I
12:34 wanted to ask you about the first thing
12:37 the quality of the craft what does it
12:39 mean
12:40 yeah well I mean this is uh something I
12:43 encounter every now and then working
12:44 with maybe like a product manager
12:47 um they mostly care about having
12:48 something something they can use as a
12:50 basis of a decision like for them data
12:54 is some sort of end product like maybe
12:56 it's a dashboard it's a report a model
12:59 they receive something and for them they
13:01 don't really care how it was created
13:04 like that's not important to them but as
13:06 a data science manager it is your job to
13:09 make sure it's made well it's made in a
13:11 way that's maintainable it's made in a
13:14 way that will scale those are things
13:17 that you as a data science manager are
13:19 probably responsible for more than
13:21 almost anyone else because you're also
13:24 let's say the person that you're you're
13:26 managing
13:27 um they build a bunch of stuff they work
13:30 in a domain for a while and then they go
13:31 do something else maybe they leave the
13:33 company maybe they get promoted into a
13:35 higher role maybe they change to a
13:36 different domain as a manager you're
13:39 then responsible for whatever they built
13:41 and you better hope that it was made
13:43 well because you're going to have to
13:45 either take it over yourself or find
13:46 someone else to take it over who doesn't
13:48 necessarily have context so making sure
13:52 that things are done well
13:54 um and in documented ways like that's
13:55 also a responsibility for a data science
13:57 manager that you probably should take
13:59 pretty seriously but it's not something
14:03 that other people necessarily have the
14:05 job of thinking about so it's more like
14:07 quality control rather than you know
14:11 actually going there and making sure
14:13 it's scalable it's more like okay I
14:15 think here this thing will not scale or
14:18 you might be missing a piece of
14:20 documentation there or things like this
14:22 right so you might have some sort of a
14:25 checklist and you go again each point
14:27 okay like we're missing this line here
14:30 how do we go about
14:32 yeah yeah that's right just kind of
14:34 oversight
14:35 um you can do it in a lot of different
14:36 ways maybe sometimes it's checklist
14:38 maybe sometimes it's setting up a
14:40 process of peer review so that other
14:42 people have context or can give feedback
14:44 on something not necessarily you it
14:46 could be a teammate of that person but
14:49 uh you are responsible for making sure
14:50 that things are done well okay so it's
14:53 more like establishing process and then
14:55 as a part of this process it could be a
14:57 checklist it could be a review or any
14:59 other way of getting there so the the
15:02 job of the manager in this case is
15:03 making sure that the process is there
15:05 and people pull this process right yeah
15:08 doing things to ensure a high level of
15:10 quality
15:12 and to the second point there in the
15:15 responsibilities of data leaders was
15:17 career growth and it's a big chunk a big
15:21 chunk of the responsibilities to make
15:23 sure people grow grow
15:25 and how do they do the managers usually
15:29 do this what kind of tools and processes
15:31 there are probably a process too for
15:33 that right so what do they usually do
15:36 for to help people grow
15:38 yeah well I think the the first thing
15:40 that you should think about when you're
15:42 a manager trying to support someone in
15:44 career growth is taking inventory of
15:47 where they are at that point in their
15:49 career and the First Dimension you
15:52 should think about is whether they are
15:54 junior or senior and Junior and senior
15:58 like that might be a literal title that
16:01 your company has but I'm not going to
16:03 use it that way in this conversation
16:04 just because it may mean different
16:06 things at different companies
16:08 um and there's probably levels within
16:10 Junior and senior that would be
16:12 meaningful potentially but those are the
16:14 two buckets I'm broadly going to speak
16:16 about
16:17 um in this conversation uh and when I
16:19 say junior I really mean someone who
16:23 is still kind of learning how to be a
16:25 data scientist whereas a senior person
16:28 has reached what is called a career
16:30 level or a terminal level these are
16:32 terms that are sometimes used in
16:33 management circles to refer to someone
16:35 who is kind of burnt level yeah I mean
16:39 that one sounds a little a little
16:40 dangerous uh or lethal
16:43 um but it's really like someone has
16:45 reached a level that it's like they know
16:46 how to be a data scientist
16:49 um they can mostly operate autonomously
16:51 and make good decisions you don't have
16:52 to necessarily like be too involved in
16:55 their day-to-day necessarily
16:57 um
16:58 and like once you reach that level at a
17:00 lot of companies they're fine with you
17:03 staying there forever like you can still
17:05 get raises every year for for merit or
17:07 cost of living adjustments but like
17:09 you're not required to grow to a new
17:11 level whereas a lot of times if you're
17:13 that's what terminal means right yes
17:15 yeah that's what I mean it's like kind
17:17 of the end of the ladder
17:20 levels are expecting you to uh like for
17:24 example a junior is expected to grow
17:26 right so if junior is not growing then
17:28 maybe there is a problem but for a
17:30 senior it's fine to stay a senior
17:32 forever yeah and like there are lots of
17:35 levels that you could go beyond senior
17:37 and one of the things that's that's very
17:39 interesting about reaching a senior
17:41 point in your career is that it you
17:44 really start getting forking paths at
17:46 the senior level like there's kind of
17:48 only one way to grow as a junior it's to
17:50 become senior uh but when you're a
17:52 senior you have so many other options
17:54 like you could become a people manager
17:56 uh you could start growing into kind of
17:59 like a technical leadership track role
18:01 like a staff senior staff principal
18:03 distinguished like these mean particular
18:06 things at different companies
18:08 um but they're they're often
18:10 um something that becomes leadership but
18:12 specifically through a technical lens
18:15 um another thing that happens a lot for
18:17 people who hit uh their their career
18:19 level or their terminal level is that
18:21 they end up going and exploring adjacent
18:23 careers so they might go and be a PM uh
18:26 they might become some kind of software
18:28 engineer uh they could be a TPM
18:31 um there are other things that people
18:33 often Branch into uh but at any rate
18:36 like the first thing you should think
18:40 about uh when you're when you're a
18:41 manager trying to work with someone on
18:43 Career growth is where are they because
18:46 people need very different things
18:47 depending on where they are
18:49 and I guess for senior as we as you
18:52 mentioned they are quite independent
18:55 already there at the airport's terminal
18:58 level we are no longer expecting them to
19:01 grow but uh I guess people still they
19:04 they do this data science thing quite
19:07 well and then maybe they have been doing
19:09 this for a couple of years already and
19:12 maybe it becomes boring right so the job
19:16 of a manager also to keep an eye on this
19:19 and also help
19:20 seniors develop too right or so what
19:23 kind of support what kind of support do
19:26 seniors need because from
19:29 from what I see seniors are like
19:32 technical experts on the project they
19:33 know everything they know how to do
19:36 anything everything how to fix anything
19:38 they help Juniors they have I don't know
19:40 they talk to product managers right so
19:42 but still even they require some support
19:45 right
19:46 yeah
19:48 um there are a couple different ways you
19:49 can think about it
19:51 um there is sort of the path of a
19:53 generalist versus a specialist
19:56 that's one type of growth that you could
19:57 start thinking about once you hit a
19:59 senior point in your career
20:01 um generalists of course will be broadly
20:04 knowledgeable of a lot of different
20:05 things in the company or maybe a lot of
20:07 different techniques that are relevant
20:08 Specialists maybe they Deep dive on a
20:12 particular type of modeling for example
20:14 um at a company that does a lot of
20:16 experimentation or as complicated things
20:18 like Network effects that they need to
20:20 factor in you could become a causal
20:21 inference specialist for example as a
20:24 form of career growth and like that is a
20:26 thing that you can go very very deep on
20:29 um but if I if I had to give kind of a
20:31 general purpose piece of advice about
20:34 growing the career of a senior person is
20:37 that very frequently the thing that you
20:39 need to do as a manager is help them
20:42 kind of move up levels of abstraction
20:44 and thinking and help them see bigger
20:47 picture things a bit more I'm like this
20:50 has certainly been true of me at
20:51 different points in my career and I also
20:53 think this is true for management
20:55 careers is that it can be very easy to
20:59 get focused on your day-to-day like be
21:00 very immersed in the details and not
21:03 remember to take a step back and think
21:05 about well like why are we doing this in
21:07 the first place or kind of like what is
21:10 the next step of this or what are three
21:11 steps ahead
21:13 um or or even trying to understand
21:15 organizationally
21:16 acquire what you're doing fits in this
21:20 is something that if you are trying to
21:22 grow the career of a senior person it's
21:24 very important to focus on it can be
21:27 very easy to just go and do stuff that
21:29 you know and one of the hardest things
21:31 to do is step back and realize that
21:34 there's a bunch of stuff happening just
21:37 slightly outside of your space that you
21:39 might be able to add value in that Arena
21:41 or you might have a perspective that's
21:43 useful or it's just something that you
21:45 should be aware of because it might
21:46 impact what you're doing right now
21:50 so as a manager how do you help seniors
21:53 take a step back so what what you
21:56 mentioned is
21:58 we need to or we need to help seniors
22:01 ask themselves uh why are we doing are
22:05 they doing what they are doing right and
22:07 how does it affect the business in
22:09 general I guess so how do we help them
22:11 do this
22:13 yeah the two biggest tools I see in a
22:16 manager's toolkit in this case is
22:19 increase their exposure to leadership
22:21 and to delegate things to them whether
22:25 they think they're ready or not in terms
22:28 of exposing them to higher levels of
22:30 leadership or just bigger scope problems
22:33 sometimes that is just well before I get
22:37 into this I'll say like there is
22:40 definitely a
22:41 phenomenon that you experience a lot as
22:43 a manager where something is happening
22:45 broadly in the company that is not quite
22:48 decided yet
22:49 and because that is not decided
22:52 the thing that people are talking about
22:54 may be doing like
22:56 they may reverse their thinking so
22:59 sometimes if a manager seems like
23:01 they're not talking about something they
23:03 you know is going on but you can't
23:04 really figure out what it is it's
23:06 probably because there's a decision that
23:07 needs to be made that hasn't been made
23:08 yet
23:10 um and you don't want to tell someone
23:11 that the decision has been made because
23:13 then you might have to backtrack and
23:14 then it's just stressful for no reason
23:18 um one type of way that you start
23:20 growing senior people is exposing them
23:22 to some of this ambiguity and complexity
23:25 and helping them learn how to understand
23:27 it sit with it and navigate it
23:31 um which a lot of times is just actually
23:33 bringing them into situations that
23:36 they've not been in before like making
23:37 sure you give them a lot of context so
23:40 they they understand it constructively
23:43 um and asking them what they think
23:44 asking them to weigh in and preparing
23:48 them to participate constructively in
23:51 those environments some people would
23:53 think of this as getting people involved
23:56 in politics maybe but politics is also
23:59 kind of a bad word for what is really
24:01 just having good relationships at the
24:04 company so getting senior people to
24:06 invest in relationships with with
24:08 cross-functional peers uh with data
24:11 scientists on other teams who are senior
24:13 this is a big way to start exposing
24:16 people to different concerns and
24:18 different levels of abstraction and
24:20 problems that the company is trying to
24:22 solve
24:23 when it comes to delegation and this one
24:26 this one is
24:27 scary sometimes to do to people on your
24:30 team is a lot of times as a manager you
24:34 are told that your team needs to solve a
24:36 problem and it can be very vaguely
24:39 stated to the point where like you as a
24:41 manager are not even sure where to start
24:43 even with your contacts even with your
24:45 experience
24:47 um it can be tempting to try and shield
24:50 the team for lack of a better word by
24:52 trying to do a lot about scoping
24:54 yourself
24:55 but one of the best things you can do as
24:57 a manager is give that to a senior
24:59 person
25:00 and ask them to start solving that
25:02 problem you're giving them
25:04 responsibility and like there's
25:06 constructive ways to give them
25:08 responsibility like you don't want to
25:10 just give them some like completely
25:12 open-ended thing that they're not
25:13 prepared for at all
25:15 um but by giving them responsibility you
25:18 are giving them a gift like you are
25:19 giving them the opportunity to
25:22 be the owner of something that is
25:24 important and it's also important for
25:26 you as a manager to delegate more
25:28 because that is part of how you grow is
25:30 by growing leaders beneath you
25:33 but even if it feels like you're you're
25:35 dumping something at someone's feet that
25:38 they're not ready for they often
25:39 surprise you and they they often rise to
25:42 the challenge and like make sure you're
25:45 you're supporting them as they go
25:47 through something that may be new for
25:48 them but a lot of times people really
25:50 like having big things delegated to them
25:54 and I was about to ask you about Juniors
25:58 but I noticed that we have a highly
26:00 appointed question about choosing the
26:04 next step for a senior so the question
26:06 is it's a senior data scientist how
26:08 should I think about my future career
26:10 path choosing the IC route lead or stuff
26:14 versus the management management route
26:17 data science manager so like well what
26:20 could you suggest help can you decide if
26:23 management is for me or I want to be a
26:25 technical person
26:27 yeah well one thing I'll say is
26:29 if you like a lot of career choices at
26:32 the senior level are reversible
26:34 um so it's okay to go and try something
26:36 for a little bit
26:38 um you could go try being a manager for
26:40 a couple of years and if it turns out
26:41 it's not for you you can very easily go
26:44 back to being a senior engineer and you
26:46 will be a better senior rather a senior
26:48 data scientist
26:49 um and you will you will
26:50 be a better senior data scientist for
26:53 having
26:54 um for having been a manager because
26:56 you'll understand a bit more about how
26:58 organizations work there is a really
27:00 good article about this phenomenon by
27:02 charity majors of honeycomb she's an
27:05 engineer rather than a data scientist
27:07 but I think this concept applies on it's
27:09 called the IC manager pendulum highly
27:11 recommend it very very good article on
27:13 this subject
27:15 um but all this is to say like if you
27:17 choose to try management it is not like
27:20 a permanent decision you can always go
27:22 back
27:23 um but if you want to try out management
27:25 before you actually make that jump I
27:28 highly recommend finding ways to
27:31 essentially be responsible for other
27:33 people
27:34 um and seeing how much you like it a
27:36 very common form of this is mentorship
27:38 maybe it is an intern that you are
27:41 responsible for a summer or a more
27:44 Junior person on your team that you lead
27:46 on a project and in general leading big
27:49 projects with more than one contributor
27:50 is a very good way for you to try out
27:53 being responsible for other people's
27:55 productivity
27:57 um this is a thing that people don't
27:59 always think about uh when when they're
28:01 thinking about becoming a manager is uh
28:04 sometimes you tell people what to do and
28:05 they don't listen to you
28:07 um and learning how to
28:11 um deal with that constructively uh or
28:13 like not even just like you tell people
28:16 you give people orders like
28:18 it maybe sounds like that's what I'm
28:19 saying but it's more like how do you get
28:21 people excited about work that needs to
28:22 be done and see it as the opportunity
28:25 that it hopefully actually is
28:27 uh or I guess like if it's just
28:29 boilerplate work that needs to get done
28:31 help them understand the value of it
28:33 even if it's not exciting and help them
28:35 feel appreciated for having done it
28:38 um that's a really good experience if
28:40 you're considering people management
28:41 because there's a lot of things about
28:43 people management that aren't fun
28:46 um and sometimes it's it's project
28:48 management uh it's something you're
28:50 going to have to do a lot if you go on
28:51 the management track so you should
28:52 definitely explore it
28:55 um if you have the opportunity to at
28:57 your company
28:58 and I think we spent a bit of time
29:00 talking about delegation and I think
29:02 also for a senior person to learn how to
29:04 delegate what they're working on to a
29:06 junior is a really good experience
29:09 very much so
29:12 yeah and I think this article that you
29:14 mentioned the IC management pendulum and
29:17 I think the summary there is uh as far
29:20 as I remember so you join a company as a
29:22 senior you go to a manager then you lift
29:25 the company you join another company as
29:26 a senior you grow to a manager and you
29:28 keep doing this until you get tired
29:30 right yeah I mean it could be at the
29:32 same company too I've seen uh people
29:35 that I've worked with they step into a
29:38 management role they do it for a couple
29:39 years and then maybe for whatever reason
29:41 they decide they want to go back to
29:43 doing IC work it might be like they have
29:46 a kid they want to like have a little
29:47 less responsibility while they're
29:49 sorting out their personal life it may
29:51 just be that they have an itch to get
29:53 back to doing Hands-On work and that's a
29:56 great reason too like there are lots of
29:58 different reasons why you would switch
29:59 between the two
30:01 um and it's it's good to do it keeps
30:03 your technical skills sharp
30:04 um but you're never too far away from
30:07 understanding how managers think either
30:10 but I guess most of the time managers
30:12 spend not managing seniors but rather
30:16 managing Juniors right because
30:19 from my experience Juniors usually need
30:22 more support than senior seniors are
30:24 pretty independent and we need to help
30:26 them grow but Juniors require more
30:29 support so like
30:32 how do we
30:33 like maybe start with uh
30:36 Juniors like how can we manage them like
30:39 what does it actually require for a
30:42 manager to manage a junior
30:46 yeah well I do think you're right to say
30:48 they require more support
30:50 um and that support doesn't always need
30:52 to come from the manager and I I
30:54 actually think sometimes it's good when
30:55 it comes from other people on the team
30:58 um right yeah yeah pretty much uh and
31:02 like this is this is like a great org
31:03 design technique uh if you have the
31:06 option at your company is
31:08 um You Spin up a new domain for data
31:11 scientists to work and you put a senior
31:13 person there first and then you add a
31:15 junior person second because then the
31:18 senior person can grow from mentoring
31:20 the junior person and the junior person
31:21 gets a lot of day-to-day support from a
31:23 senior person
31:25 um but like Juniors need more more
31:28 support
31:29 um as you're saying and thinking about
31:31 the types of support I I think are is
31:34 maybe a good way to start digging into
31:36 working with Junior people
31:39 um
31:40 since they're still kind of learning The
31:42 Craft
31:43 um there will be a lot of just skills
31:45 based support that they need
31:48 um I strongly encourage you if your
31:50 company has a career a ladder or two
31:52 look at what those things are and have a
31:54 conversation with the junior people
31:56 about where they are on different
31:57 competencies
31:59 um that's a very good way to kind of
32:02 give them
32:03 more objective criteria
32:06 um and like it might be okay this person
32:09 needs to learn this programming language
32:11 better
32:12 um or they need to learn how to
32:14 structure a data pipeline or maybe they
32:16 need to learn some stat skills as a
32:18 manager
32:20 yeah usually Juniors come from
32:24 University
32:25 with a lot of the goods let's say
32:27 modeling skills right so they have no
32:29 machine learning well but when it comes
32:30 to uh you know all these data pipelines
32:33 and so on usually what universities do
32:36 not prepare them to do is those tests
32:41 and pipelines and so on yeah definitely
32:44 like there's a lot of like boilerplate
32:46 technical things that they just need to
32:48 learn and one of the best ways to help
32:51 people learn that is give them projects
32:53 where it's required for them to learn
32:54 that uh because then they like it's part
32:57 of their job to learn that thing so it's
32:59 very easy to make time for it
33:02 um another big thing that Juniors often
33:05 need to learn kind of what you're
33:06 getting at as well as how companies work
33:09 and that's like a little bit harder to
33:11 teach people
33:13 um but a lot of times it is actually as
33:16 you're talking about different people on
33:18 a project that they're working with like
33:19 what is that person's role uh what what
33:22 type of role is that like if they're
33:24 working with product managers talking to
33:26 them a bit about well this is the type
33:28 of thing that product managers do for a
33:30 company these are how they're the ways
33:32 in which they're
33:33 evaluated like helping understand their
33:36 incentives and their mental models and
33:38 why they make the choices that they do
33:39 like that's a very important thing to
33:41 talk to Juniors about as well
33:44 um I definitely know early in my career
33:46 product managers would make choices that
33:48 I found absolutely baffling
33:51 um and I if someone had just explained
33:53 to me uh like product managers were like
33:55 trying to hit XYZ goal by this amount of
33:57 time and like ultimately the thing for
33:59 them is like they need to hit this goal
34:01 because it enables some other thing we
34:03 need to do in a subsequent quarter like
34:05 I would have understood so much better
34:07 how to work with product managers but no
34:09 one did that for me uh so I think this
34:12 is an important thing as well uh
34:15 how to actually do this recently so at
34:19 the company where I work recently a
34:22 junior data scientist joined and usually
34:24 as a part of your onboarding she talked
34:26 to me and then one thing she asked is
34:28 how can I grow faster in this company
34:31 how can I learn better how the company
34:33 works and then I got puzzled like okay
34:35 this is not something that Juniors
34:37 usually ask me and then it was okay what
34:39 do they usually what should they tell
34:41 here and what I ended up telling was
34:44 something similar to what you just said
34:46 which is funny so I said to talk to
34:50 product managers and learn how they work
34:52 but they didn't tell her how exactly to
34:55 do this and now I get a chance maybe to
34:58 ask you so next time somebody asks me
35:01 how to do this then I have an answer so
35:03 how should they actually talk to product
35:06 managers and find what the incentives
35:09 are that they have and how do they make
35:11 their decisions
35:13 yeah
35:15 um I mean product managers are people so
35:17 you can just ask them to do a virtual
35:19 coffee or a real life coffee
35:22 um if you have that option and just ask
35:24 them like hey I'm new here I'm still
35:25 learning about uh this company and about
35:28 product managers I would love to have a
35:31 chat with you to learn about your job
35:32 here and learn about your career
35:35 um it's something that people usually
35:36 like to talk about and and they like
35:38 being helpful uh so like usually if you
35:42 if you give people that context and just
35:44 say that you want to learn about them
35:45 and what they're doing they're happy to
35:48 talk to you about that
35:50 um you could even do a recurring meeting
35:52 with someone who you work with regularly
35:54 that's a great way to build a
35:56 relationship and like it find a
35:58 frequency that actually fits in with
35:59 your schedule make sure you've got time
36:02 for deep work and like you have
36:05 something to say but uh just building a
36:07 relationship with those people and
36:09 talking to them about work can teach you
36:11 a lot about how they think
36:13 and finally that he mentioned that have
36:16 something to say because recently my
36:18 manager gave me a piece of advice that I
36:22 should talk to senior leadership like
36:24 senior product managers and like had
36:27 some product directors and ask them what
36:30 are their problems and the problem I
36:32 have is
36:33 like they are so important people they
36:35 are always busy uh like what the like
36:39 how how do they like how do I even start
36:42 like okay we have a meeting and then
36:44 it's a you know this awkward silence and
36:46 then what they even tell them
36:50 um yeah I mean it's a good question and
36:52 like as you work with increasingly
36:54 senior stakeholders you definitely need
36:57 to use your time wisely
36:59 um I recommend just thinking of a couple
37:02 of questions you want to ask them and
37:03 going in with those prepared
37:05 um a general
37:07 way that you could start is just kind of
37:09 asking them about like what are you
37:11 trying to like this sounds like maybe a
37:14 little aggressive but like what are you
37:15 trying to do at this company like what
37:17 are your priorities what are your goals
37:19 what are you worried about what are you
37:20 excited about
37:22 um like you should set the context up
37:24 front in talking to a senior leader like
37:27 I was told I should I should meet more
37:30 people I'm trying to kind of learn more
37:33 not just senior leaders let's say I'm a
37:35 junior and then I get the same advice to
37:38 talk to a product manager or in this in
37:41 both these cases right it's a similar
37:43 situation like okay now this person is
37:45 in front of me what do I ask them and
37:47 then I think you said like do your
37:49 homework right so think of what to ask
37:51 them ask them about the priorities what
37:54 is and so on but it also can be
37:56 surprising so if somebody is having a
37:58 lunch with me and then asks okay what
38:00 are you worried about and then I uh
38:03 that's fair that's fair maybe that's not
38:06 how you start
38:07 um but like what you're saying do your
38:09 homework
38:10 um a really good way to start a
38:11 conversation
38:12 um like look someone up on LinkedIn ask
38:15 them about particular things on their
38:16 resume that they're interested in or
38:18 even just ask them a general question
38:19 like I mean you started this
38:21 conversation today by talking about my
38:23 my career trajectory ask them how they
38:25 got into product management ask them how
38:27 they became interested in working for
38:29 the company that you work for that's a
38:32 good way to break the ice
38:33 yeah that's a secret actually so I start
38:36 with this question on purpose and then I
38:38 take notes and then based on these notes
38:39 I come up with other questions in
38:41 addition to what we prepare in addition
38:43 to the content yeah that we did right in
38:46 order to prepare for this interview
38:49 okay so wherever we so we were talking
38:52 about uh providing mentally providing
38:55 management
38:57 help Engineers right yeah and um
39:01 yeah I guess like well I was gonna say
39:05 like if I have to like summarize like
39:06 the thing that Juniors need the most
39:09 um it is practice and exposure
39:12 um they need to do lots of different
39:14 types of work to kind of learn the
39:16 fundamentals and you learn it best by
39:18 going through the motions a couple of
39:19 times and kind of learning the typical
39:21 life cycle of a project what techniques
39:24 make sense in certain places
39:26 um it's good to make mistakes in low
39:28 stake ways as well because you often
39:30 remember mistakes better than you
39:31 remember successes
39:34 um and then exposure it's good for them
39:36 to work with a lot of different types of
39:37 people see different ways that things
39:39 are done uh so they can kind of develop
39:42 their own preferences and opinions
39:45 um and as they become increasingly
39:47 senior
39:48 um it's their job to deploy those
39:49 opinions and to use them constructively
39:52 at the company so it's good to just see
39:54 a lot of different ways of doing things
39:56 so people don't specialize too early you
39:59 should definitely not specialize as a
40:01 junior person because there's still a
40:04 lot of basic things to learn and you
40:06 might not know what you like yet
40:09 okay but uh oh I'm just wondering so
40:14 seniors are independent so we need to
40:17 help them with by delegating some of the
40:20 stuff that we need to do seems like a
40:22 good deal right so you just have the
40:24 stuff you need to work till you give it
40:26 to seniors and then we have Juniors and
40:28 we need to spend a lot more time with
40:31 them right so thinking how to we help
40:33 them grow how do we I don't know pair
40:36 them with seniors how do we make sure
40:38 they are not getting stuck how do they
40:41 we make sure they are not getting
40:42 specialized like you just mentioned so
40:45 why should we even bother High Engineers
40:48 why don't we just hire all seniors oh an
40:50 old Senior Team and then we'll delegate
40:53 all the tasks to them and tasks to them
40:55 and you know go drink coffee all day
40:58 yeah
41:01 um
41:03 of course
41:05 um no I mean a lot of people some people
41:07 do think that way where it's like we
41:09 should just hire as many senior people
41:10 as possible
41:12 um but it's good to hire Junior people
41:14 because well okay so we talk a lot about
41:17 build versus buy uh in the industry
41:20 broadly
41:21 um and when it comes to building a team
41:23 hiring senior people is kind of like
41:25 buying hiring Junior people is kind of
41:27 like building
41:29 um you can never
41:30 hire exactly the person you want uh so
41:34 with Junior people you're kind of
41:35 growing them into the next generation of
41:37 leaders that you need uh so really one
41:40 of the best advantages of having Junior
41:41 people is you've got people uh who they
41:45 they grow up in the environment that
41:47 you're in and they have really good
41:48 context for it by the time they're
41:50 senior so they end up being amazing at
41:53 your particular company
41:54 but another thing that's really
41:56 important about having Junior people is
41:58 that it helps grow senior people like a
42:01 senior person can be uh responsible for
42:05 a lot of different things uh they can
42:08 lead an area they can make a lot of
42:10 technological choices but ultimately at
42:13 the end of the day a big part for them
42:14 of growing and scaling themselves is
42:17 being responsible for more Junior people
42:19 and you get into a weird situation if
42:21 you haven't only Senior Team where
42:23 people are trying to manufacture
42:24 mentorship opportunities for themselves
42:27 like they'll like awkwardly try to
42:28 Mentor each other or claim that they're
42:30 the mentor of the other person uh and
42:33 it's just good to have Junior people uh
42:36 around who can learn from the seniors
42:38 and who the seniors can learn by working
42:40 with
42:41 it's it's just part of building an
42:44 organization that is sustainable long
42:45 term like you want to make sure there
42:47 are people coming up and as your senior
42:49 people do end up graduating like maybe
42:50 they decide they want to go to a
42:52 different company you are ready with
42:54 Junior people to rise up and fill their
42:56 spot
42:57 okay it's also with Juniors uh they are
43:01 so they do not have so much experience
43:05 like seniors and they always quite often
43:09 ask things like okay but why does it
43:11 work this way why you do this way not
43:14 this way so seniors might know but you
43:16 have to explain these things to Juniors
43:17 and then while doing this we also learn
43:20 right it's like maybe I don't know if
43:22 it's a valid comparison maybe not so
43:24 much but like with kids yeah no I mean I
43:27 I do think that's right though like you
43:30 learn a lot by having to explain
43:31 something to someone and also like what
43:33 you're saying like a junior person comes
43:35 in they have a fresh set of eyes maybe
43:37 they see something that it's like this
43:38 doesn't make sense
43:40 and like it actually doesn't they're
43:41 right you should change it and you
43:43 wouldn't have noticed it because
43:44 everyone else is just used to it
43:47 um it's helpful to have people who are
43:48 thinking about things differently as
43:50 well
43:52 okay
43:53 so yeah and this uh so you mentioned
43:56 build versus buy but in case we're
43:58 talking about software the software we
44:01 built will not leave the company in two
44:03 years but the junior might but it's
44:05 still worth fighting them yeah yeah
44:07 definitely well and just also like I
44:09 think we talked about right yeah
44:12 definitely and like as a manager another
44:14 important thing to remember is careers
44:16 are long uh you may work with these
44:18 people again in some other context maybe
44:20 it won't be at the same company uh but
44:22 it's good to have worked with people
44:24 before and know what they're like no now
44:26 that you can trust them and
44:28 um also just go in with a good
44:30 relationship from the start
44:32 maybe they will be your manager at some
44:35 point yeah also true
44:39 well we have quite a few questions so
44:41 the the most important question that we
44:45 have is as a head of data what skills
44:48 would you look for in a data science
44:49 manager what attributes would you use
44:52 for evaluation in an interview
44:55 um
44:57 well to figure out what I would need for
44:59 a data science manager it would partly
45:01 be determined by what stage of company
45:03 I'm at
45:05 um if I today were trying to hire a data
45:08 science manager
45:10 um I would probably be looking for
45:12 something different than I would be than
45:13 an established company so if you're
45:16 ahead of data at a small company and
45:18 you're looking for a data science
45:19 manager you're probably going to look
45:21 for someone who has been a manager
45:23 before and has a good idea of how to run
45:27 projects how to grow careers
45:29 has some sort of broader sense of the
45:33 company's strategy or it seems capable
45:35 of thinking about it
45:37 um like a lot of the like
45:40 if I take a moment to try to think about
45:42 like Dimensions I think are important
45:44 for people leadership you do need to
45:46 know about the craft pretty well and
45:48 have a sense of like common career paths
45:50 for that craft
45:51 uh you need to be good at growing people
45:54 and you need to be able to work
45:56 cross-functionally with other leads at
45:59 your level so a data science manager I
46:01 would definitely want someone who can
46:03 talk to engineering managers to product
46:05 managers all the different stakeholders
46:08 that you would have to work with and
46:10 certainly in the interview process I
46:11 would ensure that you meet some of those
46:14 people so you can get a sense of your
46:17 Chemistry with them
46:19 so you mean like you get a product
46:21 manager put them in the same room with
46:23 the candidate and then you have them
46:25 talk and then you observe
46:26 yeah I mean it's usually like some kind
46:28 of well I mean I'm not like watching
46:30 them through like a YouTube video or
46:32 something but it's usually like uh like
46:35 when I'm designing interview panels I
46:37 think it's pretty important for there to
46:38 be some sort of cross-functional like
46:40 you talk about values you talk about
46:42 strategy for the domain something like
46:44 that
46:45 um just so that the two of you can get a
46:47 sense of whether you would like each
46:48 other because like the the candidate
46:50 interviewing for the position should
46:52 also
46:53 really care about whether they will like
46:55 the people they're going to work with
46:56 and use the interview as an opportunity
46:58 to think about that
47:01 um so one of the things you mentioned
47:03 that you would evaluate is strategy like
47:05 how strict like how they can help with I
47:08 don't know defined in the company
47:09 strategy and things like this but to me
47:12 this term is
47:13 I have problems understanding what the
47:16 strategy is so maybe can you tell us how
47:19 exactly can you evaluate this
47:21 yeah that's fair that's fair it is kind
47:23 of a vague word much like data science
47:26 um it's by strategy I really mean they
47:29 are capable of reasoning about the
47:31 decisions they would make in this role
47:33 in the trade-offs of those decisions uh
47:36 so it might be let's talk about a
47:38 problem similar to one you would
47:39 experience like there are two options
47:41 you could choose
47:43 um what would be the advantage of doing
47:45 one versus the other how would you
47:47 measure that like how would you reason
47:49 about the way those choices would bear
47:52 out in metrics how you might think about
47:55 building a team to support that or what
47:58 sort of systems you would need it's
48:01 really trying to figure out like can you
48:03 plan can you understand the environment
48:05 you're in and come up with a solution to
48:07 address the problems that you see
48:10 and I guess for most of these cases or
48:13 for most of these skills and dimension
48:15 that human Dimensions that you mentioned
48:17 the best way to check if the candidates
48:21 have the skills is to ask them about
48:23 their past experience right like tell me
48:25 about the time when you needed to help a
48:28 train your girl right
48:30 yeah
48:31 um I mean
48:33 terrible
48:34 um where possible I prefer to put people
48:36 in a scenario where they demonstrate the
48:38 skill
48:40 um because it's easy to make up a story
48:41 or tell an overly nice anecdote about a
48:45 time that you did this thing it's a lot
48:47 better to get someone in a situation
48:50 where they they have to demonstrate
48:52 their critical thinking skills or for
48:55 something like coding like that they're
48:58 comprehending code that they see or
49:00 maybe writing some
49:02 um it's it's way more important to see
49:05 how they behave than it is to hear them
49:07 tell stories about how they behave it's
49:09 not always easy to do that of course
49:10 like this is a big thing with people
49:12 management interviews in general that
49:14 I'm not sure how to address like some of
49:17 the situations that people managers need
49:19 to
49:19 talk about in interviews like have you
49:21 ever ever had to put someone on a
49:23 performance Improvement plan for example
49:24 like you can't simulate that really like
49:27 you probably have to ask them a story
49:29 about it uh but we're possible it's it's
49:31 good to but
49:33 you mean to give some describe a
49:36 situation some context and then ask how
49:39 would you behave right so imagine you
49:41 have a I don't know uh employ employee
49:45 who is not delivering and so on like
49:48 describe the context and then what you
49:51 would do right
49:52 yeah definitely just kind of describe
49:54 what plan you would take or like if they
49:57 have previous experience it's helpful to
49:59 hear about it
50:00 um but uh I don't know in terms of like
50:02 putting someone in a situation for like
50:04 a strategy discussion that might be a
50:06 case study where you talk about like the
50:09 company has this problem or a fictitious
50:11 company totally not this company has
50:14 this problem
50:15 um let's talk about potential Solutions
50:17 and how we would we would measure them
50:19 hmm
50:21 but um I know that uh for this there are
50:25 people who are only just starting their
50:27 career in data science who are also
50:30 listening to this conversation so maybe
50:32 we can
50:34 talk about today's situation a bit too
50:36 so let's say there they want to get
50:38 hired as a junior right and we
50:41 now talked about the Juniors
50:44 um so now the competition is quite
50:46 severe right so there are
50:48 like the there are many Juniors there
50:51 are not so many Junior positions so do
50:53 you have any suggestions to them like
50:55 how can they set themselves apart from
50:58 the rest how can they get hired how can
51:00 they get noticed
51:02 yeah uh one one thing that I strongly
51:06 recommend is being open to a lot of
51:09 possibilities
51:11 um if you are a junior like there are
51:14 some companies that would be better to
51:16 work for probably
51:17 um in that like they have like a large
51:19 team where you could learn from a lot of
51:20 different people and if you have that
51:22 option you should try to go for it
51:25 um but like that isn't always true
51:27 um and a lot of times you can't get your
51:29 dream job as your first job so be open
51:31 to a lot of different possibilities and
51:34 go to a position where you can get in
51:36 the door
51:37 um get get paid well and learn a lot and
51:40 then you can start looking for something
51:41 that you're perhaps more interested in
51:43 broadly but in terms of standing out
51:48 um if the company
51:51 does not explicitly say they want
51:53 someone senior uh and you can find the
51:55 hiring manager it's helpful to talk to
51:57 them
51:58 um don't worry about like impressing
52:01 them with like some kind of portfolio
52:03 necessarily some people really like that
52:06 um some people will not read it uh
52:09 hiring managers often have a lot of
52:12 um
52:13 a lot of people contacting them uh so
52:16 like if you're if you're asking them for
52:18 a lot uh in that communication they may
52:22 not have time to respond or they might
52:23 like even if they want to they may not
52:26 have the ability to give you detailed
52:28 feedback uh basically be be friendly be
52:31 professional do your homework in terms
52:34 of understanding what the opportunity is
52:36 uh and you know just be be bold in
52:40 reaching out
52:41 and so let's say I got hired to the
52:44 company I started as a junior
52:46 and so how
52:49 how do I go about I don't know my first
52:51 month where should I talk to to make
52:54 sure that uh I know I grow my career I
52:57 get as much as possible from this
52:59 company so hopefully there is a manager
53:01 who is doing what we just described
53:04 right so but how can I as a junior help
53:07 this manager help me
53:09 yeah
53:11 um a very good thing to do is just be
53:14 very open and honest about how things
53:16 are going
53:18 um there's a common mode and this is
53:20 like even worse in remote environments
53:22 where if you were a junior person and
53:24 you get stuck on something you don't
53:26 want to talk about it uh because you you
53:28 feel like you should be able to prove
53:30 yourself or you should know better or
53:32 you should be able to solve it yourself
53:33 don't do that just tell people if you're
53:35 stuck it's their job to help you
53:38 um they it is better for you to tell
53:41 them proactively too because they might
53:43 otherwise Wonder like well what are they
53:44 doing
53:45 um they're there to help you uh and it's
53:47 a lot faster to solve it just by asking
53:50 someone and like it maybe it's not your
53:51 manager maybe it's a senior person on
53:53 the team who you feel comfortable asking
53:54 or just another junior or a teammate but
53:57 when you are like at any point in your
53:59 career really but like especially when
54:01 you're junior just talk to people a lot
54:04 especially when you feel stuck because
54:06 it's a lot easier to grow if you are
54:08 getting help from a lot of people
54:10 one of the concerns I heard from Juniors
54:13 is they are afraid of
54:17 you know interrupting other people the
54:20 senior because the senior is busy this
54:22 is a very senior person they have a lot
54:24 of stuff a lot of work right and so like
54:28 they don't feel
54:30 um like you know interrupting them every
54:33 two hours with more and more questions
54:36 what do you think they should do like I
54:40 think it's totally okay right to
54:41 interrupt but uh yeah I mean if you have
54:45 some suggestions
54:46 yeah if you're worried about that
54:49 um one thing you could do is ask them
54:51 for some kind of regular check-in and
54:53 then back to your questions uh so as you
54:56 come up with stuff like throughout the
54:58 day write it down in a doc somewhere or
55:00 a note uh and then when you have another
55:02 check in with that person ask a bunch of
55:05 stuff then
55:06 um it's also potentially worthwhile to
55:09 ask the person like when are good times
55:11 for me to interrupt you
55:13 um or to reach out
55:15 um and like a lot of companies also have
55:18 some sort of like like it has all sorts
55:21 of different names like sometimes it's
55:22 the Rubber Duck channel uh where you
55:24 keep going oh yeah support right yeah
55:29 and software engineering you're supposed
55:30 to talk to the rubber duck on your desk
55:32 uh because just talking through a
55:34 problem helps you solve it
55:36 um like usually there's some kind of
55:37 channel uh slack Channel or whatever I
55:40 don't Microsoft teams maybe something
55:43 yeah like it just there's usually some
55:46 kind of support mechanism at a lot of
55:48 companies to go and describe a problem
55:49 and like even just describing it can
55:52 sometimes help you figure it out but
55:53 then other people may see it and respond
55:56 um that's also a good place to
55:58 potentially seek out help
55:59 yeah it sometimes feels awkward like I
56:02 also sometimes find this in this
56:04 situation when I go to the support
56:06 Channel I describe the problem and then
56:08 I hit enter and then one minute after
56:10 that I realized how to solve this
56:12 problem and then people already start
56:14 answering but I already know how to
56:16 solve it yeah definitely
56:19 okay
56:20 um I feel we're jumping a little bit uh
56:23 like you know from head back to Junior
56:26 and then back but this is a very
56:28 interesting question so I want to ask
56:30 you that too I know we don't have a lot
56:32 of time but maybe we can try to cover
56:35 this uh too so what are the challenges
56:38 that you're currently facing as head of
56:40 data and what challenges you didn't
56:43 anticipate earlier
56:46 yeah
56:47 um I mean like one of the the big
56:49 challenges you always experience in
56:50 senior leadership roles is that no one
56:52 is going to tell you how to do your job
56:55 um you kind of have to figure it out on
56:56 your own uh so you may see a lot of
56:59 different problems and you're not sure
57:01 where to start
57:03 um that's certainly something that like
57:05 I wouldn't say I necessarily see a lot
57:06 of problems but I see a lot of things
57:09 that we'll need to address at some point
57:11 and figuring out what order I do it in
57:13 uh is is a big question for me and when
57:16 I'm spending a lot of time thinking
57:18 about
57:19 um
57:20 I I wouldn't say that I've seen anything
57:22 so far that I've been extremely
57:24 surprised by there are certainly genres
57:26 of problems that I know will appear on
57:29 any data team
57:31 um
57:31 what one thing perhaps that is top of
57:34 mind for me
57:36 um as a senior leader in data is how do
57:39 I change this company into a place where
57:43 my team can be successful like I need to
57:45 make my team successful but I also need
57:47 to build a culture of data literacy and
57:49 excitement about data and there are a
57:52 lot of different dimensions to that like
57:54 how do I build High trust in our data
57:57 how do I make sure people know how to
57:59 interpret it how do I make sure people
58:01 know where to find data how do I make
58:04 sure people are regularly engaged with
58:06 it these are problems that I need to
58:08 solve that are organizational
58:11 um and I can't just like send an email
58:13 and be like you all need to go look at
58:15 this dashboard every day like
58:17 if I did that uh no one no one would
58:20 maybe someone would listen to me I don't
58:21 know
58:23 um so it's a lot of like building
58:24 excitement and building culture and that
58:27 is not easy to do but it's also one of
58:30 the things that I like most about this
58:32 type of role so I'm very excited about
58:34 it
58:35 they just for any of those things that
58:38 you mentioned data literacy data
58:40 excitement uh trusting data like any of
58:45 this topic each of this topic deserves
58:47 like a separate interview a separate
58:49 episode right so yeah
58:52 maybe I'll come back sometime yeah
58:54 fortunately we need to wrap it up so we
58:58 need to finish so is there anything else
59:01 that you wanted to to say but you didn't
59:04 have a chance to if you want to say
59:06 something before we finish today
59:09 yeah um I guess the the final bit of
59:12 advice I have for managers thinking
59:13 about career growth is um careers are
59:16 really about Direction
59:18 uh and one of the most important things
59:20 you can do for people on your team is
59:22 help them feel like they have a sense of
59:23 direction and that they are building
59:25 towards something uh and if if you can
59:27 achieve that you are a master of career
59:30 growth
59:32 okay interesting I'm wondering how to do
59:34 that
59:35 maybe you have some probably have a
59:37 threat on Twitter about this right
59:40 if I don't I shouldn't I should write
59:42 one yeah you should definitely
59:45 okay thanks uh you started using Twitter
59:48 when you worked at Twitter or earlier I
59:51 I've been a long time user
59:53 um and I have become more active over
59:55 the past couple of years uh with
59:57 quarantines and whatnot but I'm fairly
1:00:01 active on Twitter so that is a good
1:00:02 place to talk to me if you want to
1:00:03 continue the conversation somehow
1:00:06 okay because I was going to ask you how
1:00:08 to find you but I think you mentioned
1:00:09 that even earlier Twitter LinkedIn right
1:00:12 yep okay yeah that was a great shot
1:00:15 thanks for joining us today thanks for
1:00:17 answering all these questions they also
1:00:19 want to thank everyone who joined us
1:00:20 today too and ask questions I saw that
1:00:23 there is a lot of discussion in the live
1:00:26 chat unfortunately I couldn't really
1:00:29 keep up with this because I was
1:00:31 interviewing but I will check so I hope
1:00:34 we didn't miss so many many questions
1:00:37 but yeah thanks everyone it was uh great
1:00:40 talking to you and have a great weekend
