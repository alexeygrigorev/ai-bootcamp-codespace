0:01 [Music]
0:09 welcome to another session of uh data
0:12 podcast well it's a bit unusual today
0:14 well alexis is here i'm here but in
0:17 instead of alexa hosting the podcast
0:19 this time i'm going to be
0:21 hosting it and i'm going to be grilling
0:22 him with questions
0:24 so a bit about alex and i we've known
0:26 each other for about
0:27 i don't know how long has it been like
0:28 say a year or two
0:30 yeah like something between that
0:33 yeah i think we met a long time ago i
0:35 don't know how uh but we started
0:37 chatting and since then we've been
0:38 chatting every other month
0:40 and
0:41 through that i think
0:43 i've seen how alexa has come to me the
0:46 crazy idea of wanting to start his
0:48 community
0:50 i thought he was crazy and i was like
0:51 wow that's a lot of work and i've seen
0:53 him really grown into
0:54 the crazy amazing communities today and
0:58 i have always had a lot of questions for
0:59 him so today i'm going to be taking my
1:01 chance
1:02 uh but first let us try to learn more
1:05 about alexey the person the person he is
1:08 at work
1:09 um so alexis in 2010
1:12 you graduated with a degree in
1:14 information technology and became a
1:16 software engineer mostly focused on java
1:18 so fast forward more than 10 years later
1:20 you're now a principal data scientist at
1:22 olx
1:23 how did that
1:24 happen
1:26 yeah so that's a
1:28 long story so i don't know how i can
1:30 compress 10 years into
1:32 i'll try to be short because actually
1:34 eugene interviewed me
1:36 half a year ago or something like that
1:38 so there is a long article that you also
1:40 published on top of data science right
1:43 so if you want to have to know a longer
1:45 version of that you can go check the
1:47 article
1:48 um
1:49 but yeah so
1:51 my background yeah java development and
1:54 then i was doing that for a couple of
1:56 years
1:57 and
1:59 then
2:01 one day i came across this website that
2:03 is called coursera maybe some of you
2:05 heard about this and on this website
2:08 there was a course called machine
2:09 learning and then i watched that course
2:11 it was by andrew eng
2:13 from stanford and then i really loved it
2:15 and then i thought okay i think i'm
2:17 wasting my time doing this java stuff
2:20 i should do something else i should
2:22 actually use some of the math skills i
2:24 picked up at university
2:26 in
2:28 and do this do this kind of stuff
2:31 so then i started doing more courses
2:34 and then i thought then i started
2:36 interviewing with companies and then
2:38 they said
2:39 yeah you know you don't have enough
2:41 experience enough education so then what
2:43 i did is i
2:45 joined a masters and then at the same
2:47 time i started freelancing
2:49 and then with freelancing
2:51 it was actually very easy to start
2:53 freelancing i was surprised
2:56 by that and then fast forward two years
2:58 i got a portfolio good portfolio with my
3:00 freelance projects with my master's
3:04 degree master's diploma thesis
3:07 and that was enough to get a job then
3:09 since then i'm doing data science
3:11 full-time
3:13 yeah engineering in my engineering
3:15 background was very helpful
3:17 in getting my first job as a data
3:19 scientist
3:20 and then at the second company i where i
3:24 worked i focused more on actually
3:26 engineering things on setting up the
3:28 infrastructure doing taking care of all
3:30 these data pipelines
3:32 and all that
3:35 because there was nobody else who wanted
3:37 to do that and i thought okay maybe that
3:39 would be me who takes care of that and
3:41 it worked out really well because back
3:44 then and they think this is still true
3:45 today
3:46 companies really value this kind of
3:48 experience so a lot of people who took
3:51 the courses they know how to train a
3:53 model in a jupiter notebook
3:55 but what's after that like how can you
3:58 deploy these things
3:59 and or how do you like before that how
4:02 do you can you work on data pipelines
4:04 and then having this experience
4:06 uh that i got at the startup really
4:08 helped me in basically every every place
4:11 every place where i interviewed everyone
4:13 was interested in that
4:15 yeah and so this experience as a startup
4:18 doing a bit of everything was also very
4:20 helpful uh
4:22 in corporate environment so leaks now
4:24 where i work is more like a corporation
4:26 than a startup i've been with elix for
4:29 more than three years so i joined as a
4:31 senior data scientist
4:34 and
4:34 yeah i think i was doing a pretty good
4:36 job because i got promoted two times
4:38 there
4:39 so my manager noticed
4:41 so i have a very good manager who
4:43 noticed that uh
4:45 all my effort and uh i got a few promos
4:48 and
4:49 yeah i guess that's it condensed like 10
4:52 years of experience condensed into a
4:54 couple of minutes
4:56 nice thank you for sharing us sharing
4:58 that with us i mean do you have any
4:59 lessons from from from your experience
5:01 so far to what have you got so what so
5:04 far
5:05 yeah maybe not
5:07 lessons
5:08 is maybe advice is to try to
5:14 you don't have to stay
5:16 within your comfort zone right so try to
5:19 step outside of your responsibilities so
5:22 this is what i did with uh what we said
5:25 in data pipelines and uh what not
5:27 and that really helped so this opened
5:31 um
5:32 the door to many many opportunities so i
5:34 think that's one thing and then another
5:36 thing is it's very similar so
5:40 it's not only about technology it's not
5:41 only about engineering so also try to
5:44 get into product development try to
5:46 understand
5:48 try to learn from your product manager
5:50 because they're there for a reason right
5:52 so they are making sure that we as a
5:54 team are working on the right thing so
5:56 try to learn from them so i did these
5:58 two things um and that was quite helpful
6:01 in my career
6:02 so maybe that and one another lesson
6:05 that may be something that they learned
6:07 the hard way is don't chase the
6:10 exciting things
6:11 like if there is a neural network that
6:14 can do amazing things it doesn't mean
6:15 that you need
6:17 that network for your business problem
6:20 probably like uh
6:22 a couple of statements will be enough or
6:24 a logistic regression or something like
6:25 that
6:27 cool um so thank you for that alexa so i
6:30 think
6:30 one other question um so you know you
6:33 share with us about all the technical
6:34 stuff that uh that you did uh early in
6:37 your career but now that you're a
6:39 principal data scientist now yeah you're
6:40 somewhat more senior can you share a bit
6:42 about what do you do uh in your work i
6:45 guess this is a question for people out
6:47 there who are thinking you know what do
6:48 actually senior data scientists do or
6:50 principal data scientists what do they
6:51 do
6:52 yeah so you can think of me as
6:55 an internal consultant so we have a lot
6:58 of teams at alex who work on different
7:00 things so we have a team that works on
7:02 moderation we have a team that works on
7:04 search and recommendation we have a team
7:06 that works on uh
7:08 um
7:09 like other things so we have like
7:12 six teams or something like this
7:14 and
7:16 i'm like a consultant to this team so i
7:18 don't belong to any particular team but
7:20 more like if somebody needs help with
7:22 something i come there and help usually
7:24 this is about
7:27 let's say somebody comes up with a model
7:30 and now they want to find out what's the
7:31 best way of deploying this model
7:34 or before that
7:36 like before even we start working on a
7:39 project
7:40 sometimes product managers reach out to
7:42 me saying hey can you help us figure out
7:44 if machine learning actually is needed
7:46 here or how would you go about using
7:48 machine learning here what kind of data
7:50 we need so i'm doing a lot of
7:53 consultancy sort of and then also
7:55 coordinating and alignment because i
7:58 don't belong to any particular team i
8:00 can see what other teams are working on
8:03 i can i know what kind of projects they
8:05 work on and when a new project starts i
8:08 can say wait a minute this looks similar
8:10 to what the other team did one year ago
8:12 go talk to them so
8:14 i
8:17 need to do this kind of thing
8:19 quite often uh saying they talk to this
8:22 team or talk to that team
8:24 and then also maybe last bit is um
8:27 like taking part in architectural
8:29 discussions
8:31 or
8:31 making technical decisions that affect
8:33 many teams like uh
8:35 how do we standardize the way we are
8:37 doing data science like
8:39 even things like what kind of package
8:41 manager we use so it's uniform across
8:43 all the aims
8:45 so
8:46 yeah and also maybe
8:48 one last aspect is mentoring and
8:50 education
8:52 i'm doing courses for example one of the
8:54 last course i
8:56 did was machine learning for product
8:58 managers
8:59 to tell them
9:01 why
9:02 we need machine learning what is
9:03 possible to do with machine learning and
9:05 things like that
9:07 and then also mentoring people like
9:08 let's say we have an analyst who wants
9:11 to become a data scientist what do they
9:13 need to do
9:14 to make the transition or there is a
9:16 data engineer who wants to become a
9:18 machine learning engineer
9:20 or sometimes
9:21 a couple of years ago we had this
9:22 discussion
9:23 um like who is it who is the machine
9:26 engineer what kind of responsibilities
9:27 they have and then sitting there with
9:29 other teams and then defining these
9:31 responsibilities that's also something i
9:34 i do
9:36 oh that's very high leverage work i mean
9:38 getting teams to talk to each other to
9:39 make sure that they don't reinvent the
9:41 wheel
9:41 removing unnecessary work and also
9:43 educating people
9:45 and you know creating courses and i can
9:47 sort of see where the motivation comes
9:50 to start data talks club
9:52 so i remember more than a year ago at
9:55 the end of 2020 i think alexis mentioned
9:57 this idea of building a community and
9:59 that turned out to be 20 talks club and
10:01 now data talks club i think now we have
10:03 almost nine thousand or is it ten
10:04 thousand already it's almost
10:06 almost ten yeah so that's pretty crazy
10:09 can you take us back to the very
10:10 beginning what gave you this idea
10:13 yeah so
10:15 when i started even before i started my
10:17 career even before i had my first
10:19 computer
10:20 communities were already like a part of
10:22 my life so i was interested in
10:25 programming
10:27 and then yeah actually i did have a
10:29 computer but i didn't have internet so i
10:31 was i became interested in programming i
10:34 had delphi borla delphi this is like a
10:37 programming language which is based on
10:38 pascal
10:40 and yeah i needed to do some stuff there
10:43 but without internet it's very difficult
10:45 uh the help
10:47 you know when you press f1 there's this
10:49 help thing it wasn't super helpful and
10:52 it also was in english and i didn't
10:53 speak english that well back then
10:56 so i had to rely on
10:57 others to help me with that and for me
11:00 it was a community so i found forums
11:03 online forums where developers who
11:06 liked delphi
11:08 when they were where they were hanging
11:10 out
11:11 and i had to to go actually to go to my
11:13 mom's place or my father's place
11:16 uh to access the internet so i would go
11:18 there and then ask for advice and then
11:21 sometimes
11:22 after a couple of months like after half
11:24 a year i would also jump in and answer
11:27 questions so that was great
11:29 so when i was at university when i
11:31 already have had access to internet i
11:34 was a part of many different online
11:35 communities not only
11:38 development related but also like some
11:39 hobbies i was into bootleg music so this
11:42 is like when you go to a concert like a
11:45 metal band concert and you film the
11:47 concert and then you exchange with other
11:49 enthusiasts
11:51 yeah so that was uh
11:54 so i i was really into this online
11:56 communities
11:57 and then i became a java developer
12:00 the first thing i did i registered at
12:02 java talks which was a
12:05 online community for people who are java
12:08 developers and this is actually where
12:09 the name comes from for from for a data
12:11 talk
12:12 yeah
12:13 yeah so i i was
12:16 inspired by that name
12:18 and i just started answering questions
12:20 there in that community and then after a
12:22 couple of months people thought that i'm
12:24 super experienced person who knows
12:26 everything i wasn't i was a junior i had
12:28 no clue what i was talking about
12:30 but in people's mind minds i was
12:34 you know somebody who knows an answer to
12:36 everything and that was a really nice
12:38 experience so and then the same story
12:41 happened when i decided to come to
12:43 switch from java development to data
12:45 science i joined a couple of online
12:47 communities and i started
12:49 i tried answering questions there and
12:52 that helped also to get
12:55 you know to know things to see what
12:57 doesn't work for people where they get
12:59 stuck what they need help with
13:01 and then doing some research and then
13:03 putting an answer
13:05 there
13:07 and yeah so for me communities were a
13:09 big part of my life
13:12 and then at some point i was
13:14 like in 2020 i was quite active on
13:17 linkedin i was i would do a post every
13:19 day um with you know different career
13:22 advice uh like daliana is doing right
13:25 now um so i was doing that sort of thing
13:28 and um i was getting a lot of questions
13:31 in
13:32 direct messages on linkedin where people
13:34 would say hey i have this situation can
13:36 you help me or i have that situation can
13:39 you help me
13:40 um i was also doing some career
13:42 consultation so i would have like a
13:44 30 minutes zoom call with people also
13:47 they would ask me different questions
13:51 funny thing is sometimes people would
13:53 come to me and say hey i'm a qa engineer
13:55 how do i switch to
13:56 let's say product management i have no
13:58 idea right i am not a qa engineer i
14:01 don't know anything about product
14:02 management but the final thing uh is
14:05 that i was able to actually help them by
14:07 just listening and asking hey but what
14:09 do you like more
14:11 and then so people would just talk and
14:13 then you know this rubber duck thing
14:15 you just need to talk to somebody to to
14:18 make a decision
14:19 and then yeah so i was doing that for
14:22 a couple of months and then i thought
14:23 okay would be nice to first
14:26 all these direct messages i get from
14:28 linkedin to somehow
14:31 scale that because it wasn't easy to
14:33 answer each and every one
14:35 and then the second thing was all these
14:38 uh
14:39 consultation goals that i had like how
14:41 about putting all these people together
14:43 in some place
14:44 and
14:45 having them to talk to each other
14:47 and this uh
14:49 is how
14:50 data talks club for the idea for data
14:52 docs club appeared so i thought they
14:54 they need a place to to hang out
14:56 together i
14:59 woke up i went to go daddy i registered
15:02 the domain there it took i don't know 10
15:04 minutes then i went to mailchimp i set
15:06 up a landing page it also took like 10
15:08 minutes and then i put this link to a
15:10 few places mostly github so i put it on
15:14 my github account
15:16 and then when people would reach out to
15:18 me i say i would say here is this
15:20 community you can actually not only ask
15:23 me a question but also get an answer
15:25 from others to join it and then people
15:28 would
15:29 like would damn me and then i would
15:30 reply with that and b they would just
15:33 stumble uh
15:34 upon my
15:35 github and then find a link there and
15:37 also join
15:39 and
15:41 yeah and it got some traction
15:43 people like i started talking to people
15:45 i started to
15:47 ask them different questions hey what do
15:49 you do why did you join what brought you
15:51 here
15:52 um
15:53 then yeah it was going quite well and
15:55 then we had the first event um
15:57 which attracted also quite a few people
16:00 and then i will also uh you probably
16:02 know the materials from envelopes
16:04 envelopes community they have a podcast
16:07 and i was a guest on his podcast nah
16:10 and i really liked the format so the way
16:13 he invited people and then
16:16 basically what we are doing right now
16:17 right so we are having an interview but
16:20 it's live
16:21 so people can join ask questions
16:24 and then it is recorded and released as
16:26 a podcast
16:28 so i really like that format and
16:32 yeah i decided to try something similar
16:35 and yeah this is how it started
16:38 you recall i recall you shared some
16:40 statistics with me at beyond right i
16:42 think like
16:42 first mother the growth was clean after
16:44 the six months i mean what happened
16:47 could you refresh your memory about how
16:54 yeah i don't remember the numbers
16:57 so i think uh
16:59 like the first year by the end of 2020
17:03 um we had like
17:06 500 people
17:08 um wow
17:10 by the end of 2021 it was
17:14 9 000. so yeah
17:17 but mostly like it what i did the first
17:19 month um i think i i sat here i told you
17:23 that i was um
17:25 welcoming everyone in the community i
17:27 was trying to get to know them i was
17:29 trying to ask uh what brought them here
17:33 and
17:35 trying to learn what kind of problems
17:36 they have
17:38 and
17:39 what people are interested in
17:41 and what i can do to solve their
17:43 problems so this is what i was doing the
17:45 first month um so welcoming people
17:48 trying to understand what kind of
17:50 programs they have
17:52 and then um
17:53 that actually doesn't scale well when
17:55 more people join at some point i just
17:57 stopped doing that because like when uh
18:00 three four people join per day i can do
18:02 that but when 10 people or 20 people
18:05 join per day that's not possible to
18:08 to welcome everyone and ask them
18:11 these questions and then
18:13 the first quarter
18:16 we started events so a friend of mine he
18:18 asked me if i know a place where he can
18:21 give a talk
18:23 and i said yeah actually you know what
18:25 there is a place where you can do that
18:27 there's a place now
18:28 yeah
18:30 i think eugenie also attended that event
18:33 it was about sage maker
18:35 deploying models with stage maker right
18:37 it was from dmitry
18:39 um that was the first event and like 70
18:41 people or something like that joined the
18:43 first event i thought wow so cool i
18:46 should do more of that
18:48 actually the second event was like 20
18:50 the 31 was like 10. so i think it's just
18:53 you know the excitement of something new
18:55 so that excitement gradually went down
18:58 and then it
19:00 i think around 20 people is
19:02 the
19:04 um
19:05 the usual attendance i would say
19:07 so 70 is very it's more like an outlier
19:11 uh yeah so this is when i started
19:14 actively announcing that we have events
19:16 that we have this awesome community i
19:18 was creating linkedin posts so before i
19:21 was like in more in the stealth mode
19:24 but then this is where we went live
19:26 and then in first six months so
19:30 we experimented with different
19:31 activities
19:33 like this book of the week
19:35 thing when we invite book authors and
19:38 ask them questions about their books
19:40 um so i took this idea from a forum
19:43 called
19:45 called javarange so they used to do
19:47 something similar so i thought it would
19:49 be cool to do
19:50 something like that in data docslab as
19:52 well
19:53 then yeah we started the podcast
19:56 and then at some point even a conference
19:58 we did a small conference i think you
20:00 also were a speaker there on that
20:02 conference one year ago
20:05 yeah that attracted quite a few people i
20:07 think this is how it started so after
20:09 that conference i think more than 1 000
20:12 people
20:13 joined the community
20:14 and then gradually now by the end of
20:17 this year it reached
20:20 yeah
20:20 nine thousand was almost 10 yeah yeah
20:24 so i recall uh
20:26 so i i recall the first time uh that i
20:28 really got a shock was man alexey
20:30 invited me to share on data talks club
20:32 right
20:33 okay what's data talking about
20:35 you learn more about it and that's when
20:37 i realized that alexa was actually
20:39 putting out two videos or podcasts a
20:42 week
20:43 uh that's a lot of work i mean on top of
20:45 a full-time job at orax i was wondering
20:48 uh could you share with us how do you do
20:50 it how do you sustain were there times
20:52 that you actually felt like skipping for
20:54 a week
20:56 yeah there were times what helped
20:57 actually with not skipping is
21:00 planning in advance so i would uh sit
21:04 right now for example and plan one month
21:06 in advance
21:07 and then i would announce this and once
21:09 it's announced it's very hard to skip
21:11 right because already people signed up
21:13 they expect me to show up uh and then of
21:16 course there is a guest who comes uh
21:19 yeah so there is no way uh for skipping
21:22 after it announced so i tried to do this
21:25 like uh for
21:26 a month in advance so that really helps
21:29 to
21:31 to sustain
21:33 that
21:34 um
21:36 yeah and the the way it works yeah so i
21:38 need to reach out to people
21:40 um asking hey we have this
21:43 great community we have weekly events do
21:45 you want to speak at our event or be a
21:48 guest to our podcast
21:49 um only half maybe answer and
21:53 out of this half maybe you a half say
21:55 yes so um yeah it's uh
21:59 it's not always easy to find speakers
22:01 um what i found helpful is when i ask
22:04 somebody for a recommendation
22:06 i ask hey do you know somebody who can
22:08 speak at our event
22:11 and then when i reach out i say uh
22:14 person x recommended to reach out to you
22:16 and they said that you would be
22:18 interested in speaking well what do you
22:19 think about that and that increases uh
22:22 chances of getting a positive answer
22:25 a lot
22:26 yeah so with webinars it's easier so
22:28 usually there is not so much preparation
22:30 on my site i usually the guest
22:34 the speaker takes uh like it's mostly on
22:37 them to prepare so i only need to get
22:39 like i tell the description
22:41 um it's a
22:43 biography
22:44 like a picture so that's not easy oh
22:47 that's not difficult for me to prepare
22:49 for that
22:51 with podcasts it's a bit trickier
22:52 because i actually need to do some
22:54 research
22:55 um
22:55 [Music]
22:56 put together so it's usually there is a
22:58 topic
23:00 so first of all i need to know what kind
23:02 of things i can ask this person so then
23:04 i need to do some research look at the
23:06 internet footprint of this person see
23:08 what they usually talk about
23:10 or ask them hey what do you want to talk
23:12 about but when i do this they say oh i
23:15 don't know what do you want to ask me
23:17 and then yeah i usually need to do some
23:19 research and then come together a list
23:21 of questions
23:22 then i sent this doc to a guest so then
23:24 the guest says okay yes i can answer
23:26 this this and this question but you
23:28 don't like this question let's remove
23:30 that so we do like a couple of
23:31 iterations and once they are comfortable
23:34 with the questions then we make an
23:35 announcement so there is
23:38 like
23:39 some time to prepare in for podcasts but
23:42 i actually enjoyed doing that quite a
23:44 lot so doing some research and preparing
23:46 these questions
23:49 and then after that i announced it on a
23:51 couple of platforms so we use eventbrite
23:53 even bright we use meetup so i'm making
23:56 some announcements there
23:58 um
23:59 and i use
24:01 automation tools like zapier so it's
24:04 like
24:05 the moment i post something on
24:07 evanbright then it posts a link to
24:11 slack it posts a link to twitter it
24:13 posts a link to linkedin and it really
24:15 helps me with a lot of routine stuff
24:18 so that's that's helpful um
24:22 so that's a bit easier for me to manage
24:24 these things so that's another reason
24:26 how i sustain doing this because i rely
24:28 on tools like zapier to make my life
24:31 easier
24:32 um
24:33 yeah i guess that's uh that's a summary
24:38 that's really cool in how you use your
24:40 ability to
24:41 as an engineer to try to automate stuff
24:43 and try to make it easier
24:44 for you talk stuff there's just a lot of
24:47 different kind of talks right i think i
24:49 was looking at it there's
24:50 open source spotlight there's minis um
24:52 there's no book of the book of the week
24:55 what are all these different talks about
24:56 and what do you hope to achieve from
24:58 each type of talk
25:01 yeah so indeed
25:04 so
25:04 let's start with open source spotlight
25:06 so open source spotlight is as name
25:09 suggests it gives spotlight to open
25:11 source projects
25:13 so we
25:14 invite open source authors to talk about
25:17 the tools the tools they are building
25:20 um
25:21 so this is something i'm doing more like
25:22 on a background i don't think i ever
25:25 announced that thing that hey we're
25:27 doing this thing just one day
25:29 a video like that appeared
25:32 it was actually
25:33 you probably know neil latia because he
25:35 also interviewed him yeah so he is doing
25:38 a model store um he
25:40 this is like a model store uh
25:43 open source framework for storing your
25:46 models so i interviewed him once and i
25:49 like this format
25:51 of talking to open source authors
25:53 and then i reached out to more and more
25:55 people with that
25:57 so i even though i haven't announced so
25:59 these videos are published to our
26:02 youtube channel so some people
26:04 uh watched it so what i want to do there
26:07 is i want to create a page on our
26:09 website that is called tools and all
26:11 these interviews all these open source
26:13 tools will end up there on
26:16 on data talks clubs website
26:19 so actually by the way we are now i'm
26:21 working on creating a new design for the
26:24 for the website so this new design will
26:26 already have this tools page
26:28 so that's open source spotlight then we
26:30 have
26:31 you mentioned i think minis right so
26:33 minis is something that when i was on
26:36 vacation so i was preparing to go on
26:38 vacation for one month and i thought
26:40 okay like it's not a good idea to
26:44 not have any activity on the youtube
26:46 channel or in the community for one
26:48 month
26:49 so what can i do to actually to have
26:52 some activity there to have people in
26:53 the community
26:55 entertained
26:57 so yeah i thought
26:59 let me reach out to a few people who are
27:02 active in the community
27:04 and ask them about some stuff some
27:06 things
27:08 for 10-15 minutes
27:10 and that was the idea of minis so i
27:12 reached out to a couple of people
27:14 we recorded that
27:16 and then every week of my vacation
27:19 during the time when we usually have a
27:21 webinar i would release this video so to
27:24 keep the channel active
27:26 and that was only for one month i really
27:28 loved i really liked the format
27:31 but given the amount of other activities
27:33 i'm doing it's just difficult to to also
27:36 add that so for now there are no minis
27:39 anymore
27:40 but yeah maybe one day we'll come back
27:42 to that
27:43 and have more of that because i really
27:45 like the format then it's small and
27:47 focused
27:48 unlike this one which is long and not
27:50 focused
27:51 yeah i know
27:52 it's great actually these all these
27:54 different ideas came out uh just out of
27:56 necessity right it's not something that
27:58 was planned
27:59 okay last last question about the
28:01 community before i want to ask you about
28:03 your book
28:04 um so what are some of the most popular
28:06 talks or guests you had and not
28:08 considering engagement well you're some
28:09 of your favorites
28:11 yeah so there are very popular as
28:14 popular
28:15 well known yes so martin klepman who is
28:19 the author of designing data intensive
28:21 applications so he was doing amma in our
28:24 slack community
28:26 so probably that was the most famous
28:28 person we had and
28:30 of course like i put an announcement in
28:32 reddit and it had like 100 likes in uh
28:35 one hour or something like this like
28:37 people really like that brought quite a
28:39 few people to the community
28:42 so that was very well received and then
28:44 uh like i after that i compiled on all
28:47 his answers and also published them as a
28:49 web page and also generated some some
28:52 attention
28:53 then another famous guest i don't know
28:55 if he considers himself famous you
28:57 probably know him it's santiago from who
29:00 is
29:00 who has quite a lot of followers on
29:02 twitter
29:03 um more than
29:05 100 000 right now
29:07 so i would qualify him as as famous
29:11 because that's quite a following that he
29:13 has on twitter
29:14 so i had him as a guest
29:17 he was talking about his transition from
29:19 software engineering to machine learning
29:23 then
29:25 yeah
29:26 another talk that was very well received
29:29 uh
29:30 uh from elena elena samuilova she was
29:33 talking about how your machine learning
29:35 learning project would fail so it was
29:37 also a talk that she gave during the
29:39 conference in this conference one year
29:41 ago
29:42 and it got quite a lot of attention like
29:44 it has more than 1 000 views
29:48 um so that was quite
29:50 a good talk the talk was good and it
29:52 also received a lot of a lot of
29:54 attention
29:55 and then you also asked about
29:57 things that didn't get a lot of
29:59 engagement but more like my favorites
30:02 so there are two talks that i really
30:04 loved i really loved these topics and
30:07 my interview with the guests and these
30:09 are the least popular topics uh the
30:12 least popular episodes of the data talks
30:15 club podcast i don't know why they were
30:18 really good in my opinion so the first
30:20 one
30:21 was about development advocacy for data
30:25 science from ellie o'brien
30:27 o'brien
30:29 yeah i guess
30:30 people are not so much into deaf
30:33 advocacy in the community but the talk
30:35 was very nice
30:37 and the second
30:38 least popular talk was from dimitrius
30:41 from the melops community about
30:43 community building so i guess it's also
30:45 kind of
30:46 off topic for data talks club oh yeah so
30:50 these two events they were quite good so
30:53 i really love i really like the topics
30:56 uh i really like the i liked the guests
30:59 so it was quite an engaging conversation
31:02 but yeah i don't think these two podcast
31:05 episodes got
31:06 enough attention
31:07 uh i suspect that both of these uh
31:10 topics are a bit off topic for
31:12 uh data talks club um
31:16 your audience probably more data exactly
31:18 exactly but i really loved them
31:20 personally because this is something
31:22 that i'm interested in like
31:24 for example talking to the mattress
31:26 about community building
31:27 most of these things that he shared with
31:29 me i could apply immediately
31:32 for data talks club so that was useful
31:34 for me personally
31:37 okay yes one last question uh and i know
31:39 we are coming out on time but one last
31:41 question before i have a lot of
31:42 questions to ask you about your book uh
31:44 i know you've been trying to monetize
31:46 the community you know with the main
31:47 goal of making the community more
31:48 self-sufficient
31:50 uh you know maybe hiring more people
31:51 making it less reliant on you so that
31:54 you can go on vacation and data club can
31:56 still continue uh can you share how
31:58 that's going uh how can people support
32:00 their talks club
32:02 yeah
32:03 i i'm thinking about the word monetize
32:06 if i like it or not because there is a
32:09 bit of a negative sentiment to me about
32:11 this
32:12 i don't know why
32:14 but yeah the idea is to
32:17 earn some money with the work i'm doing
32:19 so
32:20 mostly
32:22 for me i was spending money on the
32:24 community
32:25 uh so i actually spent around
32:28 500 euros per month
32:30 wow that's alive that's uh yeah so
32:33 that's all i have for a good salary but
32:35 yeah that's a couple thousand a year
32:37 that's a lot yeah that's a lot
32:39 um so
32:40 for me like i like doing this but
32:43 getting some of this money back would be
32:45 nice so and i was thinking how can i
32:48 actually
32:49 do that how can i start earning some
32:51 money
32:52 and then the second thing is
32:55 yeah like you said i'm
32:58 it would be nice to
33:00 for me to be able to offload some of the
33:02 things i'm doing to
33:04 to hire somebody to do some of the
33:06 things there are a lot of routine and
33:08 mundane tasks like setting up all these
33:10 events
33:12 that could be
33:14 delegated to somebody
33:16 if i had money for that because i think
33:18 500 euros is already quite a lot to
33:21 spend even more on top of that yeah so
33:23 for the last six months i've been
33:26 talking to
33:28 different companies and then i was
33:29 asking them hey do you would you like to
33:31 support the community
33:33 um
33:34 and it was it is very difficult for me
33:37 so i'm more like i consider myself an
33:39 engineer
33:40 um
33:42 so i don't have this
33:44 how to say sales uh
33:46 mindset so for me it's very difficult to
33:48 sell so to sell it's very unnatural to
33:50 me so i'm more used to
33:53 sitting in front of a computer and
33:55 coding something rather than talking to
33:57 people and then
34:00 convincing them to
34:02 to give me some money that was
34:04 that is very difficult to me
34:07 yeah so so far it wasn't very fruitful
34:12 i'm learning a lot so i'm taking courses
34:14 about sales i don't know if they are
34:16 helpful
34:17 uh let's see
34:19 yeah
34:21 i did find a few
34:23 uh sponsors um there was one um
34:28 so the one person wanted to advertise an
34:30 event so they paid me some money so they
34:33 advertised this event through the
34:34 newsletter
34:36 and
34:37 i don't think people actually engaged
34:39 with this link at all so it was very few
34:42 registrations
34:44 so it was
34:45 super low engagement the event was
34:47 actually good i don't know why um
34:49 and that person said okay yeah like the
34:52 it's just not uh
34:54 um
34:55 how to say like uh it's not bringing any
34:58 value so the return on investment is
35:00 very bad
35:01 well but he paid me money so that was
35:03 already good
35:05 then another one was from topcoder so
35:08 you know this topcoder they host data
35:10 science competitions as well so at the
35:12 end of like it was less than one month
35:14 ago i think so they also gave me some
35:17 money to advertise a competition they
35:19 were hosting
35:20 and yeah they they actually did like the
35:23 result results so the engagement was
35:26 quite good
35:27 so i keep my fingers crossed that they
35:29 will and they like this and this they
35:32 will come back for more things like that
35:36 then i also managed to partner
35:39 with taloka to locate the company
35:41 similar to
35:43 mechanical turk from amazon so they are
35:45 doing crowdsourcing
35:47 and we will organize a workshop it's
35:50 actually already announced it's on our
35:52 website
35:53 so this is a workshop about
35:56 using crowdsourcing for monitoring the
35:58 mod the performance of your models so
36:00 using humans
36:02 to
36:03 uh humans in the loop to see if
36:06 your model is still doing good uh is
36:09 still performing well and if it doesn't
36:11 then how can we
36:13 3d retrain with training for example so
36:16 it's about that i think i
36:18 think the topic is pretty interesting so
36:20 i hope people will also like this and
36:22 will come and the local will like it and
36:25 they will decide to do more events like
36:28 that with us so if you're listening for
36:30 this right now you can go check our
36:32 website there is an event from i think
36:34 it's called crowdsourcing for model
36:36 performance and you if you think this is
36:38 interesting please sign up because they
36:40 will look at these numbers and if the
36:42 numbers are good then they will consider
36:45 to gonna sign up now
36:49 uh yeah and time right now i'm in
36:51 process of talking to a few more
36:53 companies
36:55 i would like to convince them to
36:58 to do something like longer term
37:00 sponsoring like maybe sponsor for a year
37:02 um
37:03 [Music]
37:05 yeah so far i haven't
37:08 how sales people say closed right so
37:11 nobody signed up yet nobody signed the
37:13 contract
37:14 but
37:15 let's see how it goes uh
37:17 it's actually something entirely new to
37:19 me it's way out of my comfort zone
37:22 so i'm also learning that
37:25 i hope we will see new sponsors soon
37:29 i keep my finger crossed and
37:32 yeah so and
37:34 yeah please
37:35 interact with engage with content from
37:38 sponsors if you think it's valuable
37:40 because they're looking at these numbers
37:42 and
37:43 this is what they
37:45 will use to decide if they want to
37:46 sponsor more communities or not because
37:49 that will be very helpful for me
37:51 personally
37:53 like for the community for me personally
37:54 to be able to use some of this money to
37:57 invest back in the community maybe hire
37:59 a personal assistant to take care of all
38:01 these mundane tasks and all that so if
38:04 you're a company if you're working in a
38:07 company maybe you can talk to
38:10 i don't know your marketing department
38:12 and then see if they would be interested
38:13 in sponsoring and supporting data talks
38:15 club and if they would be maybe you can
38:18 connect us that will be super helpful
38:22 and that's the best than just
38:24 uh no i like
38:27 says initially nothing is uh while
38:29 looking for sponsors and it's gonna be
38:31 easier you don't really have the queue
38:32 to have an event
38:34 because he can give his full attention
38:36 so thank you for sharing us with us
38:38 about that alexa about their talks club
38:40 and you know how much work it was
38:47 uh so recently you wrote a book called
38:51 ml bootcamp
38:52 well you've been
38:54 putting a lot of effort into it and it
38:56 was recently published late last year
38:58 uh can you share everything about that
39:00 book uh what is it about who is it for
39:03 and why did you write it
39:06 yeah i'll try to be brief because there
39:07 are still uh questions from the
39:09 community that i want to cover
39:11 uh yeah so this book was for people like
39:14 me for software engineers who
39:16 want to go to machine learning so and
39:19 there i focused
39:22 on teaching through projects and i also
39:24 focused on
39:26 being more end to end rather than just
39:28 here is how you train your model in
39:30 jupiter notebook and here's
39:32 you know these nice graphs so what
39:35 happens after that so there are
39:37 three chapters devoted to deployment
39:40 um there's so like deployment with flask
39:45 and deployment with aws lambda
39:46 deployment with kubernetes so these kind
39:49 of things are there as well and i think
39:51 this
39:52 is one of the things that
39:54 separates this book from other books i
39:56 don't think there are many other books
39:57 that talk about that
40:00 and yeah there is also a course based on
40:02 the book it's called machine learning
40:04 zoom camp
40:06 which is free it's based on the book
40:09 it's just in video format and then it's
40:11 cohort based
40:13 well it was cohort based now it's almost
40:15 over
40:15 um so if you prefer this kind of content
40:18 more you can check it out
40:21 in our slack it's course email melzoon
40:23 camp
40:24 basically each chapter there is a
40:28 like a model in that book but there are
40:30 also there is also homework
40:32 and you're getting some points for doing
40:34 this homework then there are also
40:36 projects and uh to get a certificate
40:39 you'll need to finish the projects so if
40:41 you don't finish the projects then you
40:43 will not get
40:45 a certificate at the end so i think it's
40:48 the most important thing
40:49 is to do these projects so when you
40:52 see how others do something now you have
40:54 to repeat
40:56 to do it yourself but not to just follow
40:59 but do something on your own and that's
41:01 why i
41:03 make it mandatory for people to pass to
41:06 projects to get a certificate
41:08 so yeah check it out
41:11 so why why i mean the course that you
41:14 release is like 13 lessons over four
41:16 months
41:17 uh why do it for free i mean what's your
41:20 motivation behind and how much effort
41:22 did it take to create that course
41:23 oh that's too much i wish i was timing
41:26 myself i didn't know what i was signing
41:28 up for
41:29 when i was uh when i announced it
41:31 because it's just an insane amount of
41:33 work
41:34 yeah but uh yeah i always wanted to do
41:36 the course i wanted to maybe i should
41:38 have started with something smaller
41:40 than that yeah i always wanted to do
41:43 that and see how uh
41:46 how it feels to actually do a course
41:48 yeah and then there was also another
41:51 [Music]
41:53 motivation is to spread the word uh
41:56 about the book
41:57 um because everyone will know that this
42:00 book exists
42:01 at least everyone who is taking who has
42:03 taken the course and then also i wanted
42:05 to attract more people to the community
42:08 so it kind of served multiple purposes
42:11 i really liked the engagement i really
42:13 liked the outcome even though it was
42:15 very difficult to record i really i
42:17 would record some things multiple times
42:20 and i would spend a lot of time editing
42:21 i still haven't finished editing the
42:23 last module about uh keep low serving
42:26 but i really like the result i really
42:28 like the engagement the feedback i got
42:30 from people
42:32 so yeah
42:34 that went quite well so maybe for the
42:36 next course i'll try to do something
42:39 less ambitious
42:41 perhaps
42:42 but i'm quite satisfied with the outcome
42:44 and the feedback i'm getting from people
42:46 is really motivating and inspiring
42:49 well the projects you've taken on have
42:51 always been have always had that quality
42:53 where it's very very big but you managed
42:54 to tackle it anyway uh their talks club
42:57 and then the book and then now the
42:58 course well now we have a couple of
43:00 questions from the community yeah lynn
43:02 asked what advice would you give to
43:04 someone starting in this field um and
43:06 how would they go about finding mentors
43:09 yeah my advice would be to join a
43:11 community
43:13 and this is what i did and i think it
43:15 worked quite well for me every time i
43:17 wanted to
43:18 start in a new field i joined the
43:20 community and it didn't it wasn't always
43:23 career related so as i said i was into
43:26 exchanging these
43:28 bootlegs bootleg videos
43:30 um
43:31 yeah so join a community and then after
43:34 you join don't just
43:36 sit there and watch what people talk
43:37 about
43:38 answer questions do some research and
43:41 then people will think that you're some
43:43 sort of uh
43:45 uh i don't know experienced person who
43:47 knows everything they don't have to to
43:49 know that maybe you're not
43:51 uh
43:52 yeah that's uh the number one advice i
43:54 will give i guess the question from
43:56 amrita have you ever felt like giving up
43:58 during your data science journey uh what
44:00 kept you going what what motivation
44:04 yeah for my data science journey
44:08 yeah i don't remember actually
44:10 having this feeling of giving up
44:12 entirely
44:13 but sometimes i would feel frustrated if
44:15 i cannot derive a formula
44:18 or if i wouldn't be able to understand
44:20 this vm
44:21 now i look back at this and find it
44:23 funny like why did i spend time on
44:25 learning about these vms why did i think
44:27 they are important
44:28 like i wish somebody
44:30 had told me that hey don't waste your
44:32 time on this vms
44:34 so yeah sometimes i felt frustrated i
44:36 thought
44:37 i was learning something important but
44:38 these things weren't important at the
44:41 end
44:42 um but what motivated to keep me going i
44:44 guess was the interest that spark that
44:47 andrew hank um
44:50 created in me like when i first watched
44:53 that video i thought okay wow it's so
44:55 cool you can actually use
44:57 data for these kind of things
44:59 and it felt like large magic to me
45:02 and
45:03 being able to do this sort of magic and
45:06 then seeing the results in action i
45:07 think this is what motivated me
45:10 yeah
45:11 so i still have that motivation maybe
45:14 less so than
45:16 seven years ago because now some of the
45:18 things that uh
45:19 uh become routine like you know this
45:21 perimeter tuning
45:23 and then all this uh
45:25 other things that are maybe less
45:27 exciting but uh
45:29 i found out that i really like the
45:31 engineering component of this
45:33 and
45:34 seen my result in action i think this is
45:37 what still keeps me going
45:39 yeah i know i mean i think initially
45:41 when we first started it's quite amazing
45:43 that you can actually use data to
45:44 predict what's going to happen
45:46 and now building things with your own
45:48 hands
45:49 a question from william how do you keep
45:51 up to date with new tools and advances
45:53 in the field and at work how do you
45:56 evaluate new tools and libraries
45:59 yeah so to answer the first part of the
46:00 question from william is i do not keep
46:03 up to date with new tools and advances
46:06 because it's not possible
46:08 like i remember
46:10 i would use a recess reader
46:13 it was the old reader something like
46:15 google reader but maybe there are people
46:17 who still remember the google reader it
46:19 was awesome
46:20 um so there are some recess readers and
46:23 i would um
46:24 set up a recess feed from archive to see
46:29 and then it just like
46:30 a couple of weeks i understood that it's
46:33 too much
46:34 that there is no it's not humanly
46:36 possible to look at this amount of
46:38 information
46:39 and then at some point i just okay like
46:43 why do i do this like what does it
46:45 actually bring me
46:46 and then i think uh this
46:49 this understanding this realization came
46:51 with a bit of experience understanding
46:54 that uh you know sometimes what business
46:56 needs is not a state of the art
46:59 so i better look at what other companies
47:01 are doing what works for them
47:04 and
47:06 try to stay up to date with that not
47:08 with the recent deployments not with
47:10 recent advances
47:12 uh and with tools also like every day
47:15 there is a new tool like you go on
47:16 twitter and then there are tools
47:19 some new tools that will solve all your
47:21 problems but one month after that nobody
47:23 remembers about these tools
47:25 so probably it's a good idea when uh you
47:27 know you see a trend that like over
47:29 multiple months uh this tool keeps
47:32 appearing people keeps talking about
47:34 this so actually i want to keep to try
47:36 quedro do you know kedro
47:38 no have you heard about this so i've
47:40 heard i've been hearing about this tool
47:42 for quite a while now to actually give
47:44 it a try
47:45 um so this is uh
47:47 like uh pipe psychic learn pipelines but
47:49 better this is how i understood it so i
47:52 want to give it a try but yeah so i just
47:54 try to
47:55 not stay up to date that's uh
47:59 that's my answer and then how i evaluate
48:01 new tools
48:03 then
48:04 i don't
48:07 because
48:08 yeah
48:09 there are many other problems that we
48:11 need to solve
48:12 sometimes you know these tools appear
48:14 and then we have this hackathons when we
48:17 can try to play with these tools and see
48:20 if it's worth including them in the
48:23 pipeline
48:24 but it's not something i do on a regular
48:26 basis so it's not like i
48:28 try to devote like i heard this advice
48:31 like spend 10 percent of your time
48:32 trying to play with new stuff
48:36 maybe this is good advice actually but i
48:38 do not follow that because
48:40 i have too many problems other problems
48:42 that i need to solve that are not tool
48:44 specifics as tools specific they are
48:47 more focused on
48:48 like are we actually building the right
48:50 thing do people care about that like it
48:53 doesn't matter what kind of tool we use
48:54 for that right i agree
48:57 so well besides how you are so busy at
48:59 work and you don't have time to
49:01 evaluate those new tools rob asks how
49:04 are you so productive uh what does your
49:06 process look like how do you balance
49:07 your full-time job at orx and data talks
49:10 club and writing a book
49:12 and doing ml zoom cam do you even
49:14 sleep
49:16 yeah sleep is annoying right so we have
49:18 to get it
49:21 sleep is overrated no i'm joking
49:25 so yeah like i i'm maybe i'm good at
49:28 keeping appearances so but actually i'm
49:32 like i like to slack like i'm i like to
49:34 procrastinate so i'm
49:37 keeping things up like keeping things
49:40 very long before starting doing this
49:44 so yeah my process looks like
49:47 i postponed things till the very last
49:48 day and then do them um
49:50 [Music]
49:51 like
49:52 before the the deadline
49:54 uh so for me what helps is having these
49:57 deadlines and having these deadlines
49:59 public and if i have that like with the
50:01 course
50:03 like because every week i had to release
50:05 something that kept me you know
50:08 not procrastinating too much
50:11 so i don't know if it's a secret but
50:12 yeah
50:14 i don't think that makes sense it's like
50:16 building in public right and then once
50:17 you have a date uh
50:19 people hold you accountable for it
50:21 people are expecting you and you don't
50:22 want to let people down and so therefore
50:24 you deliver
50:25 yeah but unfortunately i have to sleep
50:27 that's i
50:28 haven't found a way around that
50:31 all right so we have a few more
50:32 questions uh queen asked how do you
50:35 learn technical subjects how do you know
50:36 if you're able to apply it well
50:38 and you mentioned that you keep notes
50:40 about your projects could you shed some
50:42 light onto that
50:44 so learning technical subject is i think
50:46 the best way especially for technical
50:48 subjects is to do it through projects
50:51 i think you eugene i think you mentioned
50:54 this concept uh like a year ago maybe um
50:57 just in time learning yeah so you build
51:00 the project and then there is a thing
51:02 you need to learn and then you start
51:04 looking it up and then
51:06 you solve your problem
51:09 and you learn enough just to solve this
51:11 problem so you don't learn entire
51:14 you know machine learning just to solve
51:16 this
51:17 classification problem you just maybe
51:18 learn logistic regression or whatever
51:21 so
51:23 that's
51:24 that's how i try to learn technical
51:27 subjects by doing projects and by
51:29 focusing on these projects so that helps
51:31 me focus on that
51:35 so how do you know if
51:36 you can apply it well
51:38 well that's uh i guess asking for
51:41 feedback uh
51:42 and then uh like at work that would mean
51:44 deploying things and then doing a b
51:46 tests uh things like that
51:48 but
51:50 yeah like for my personal projects is am
51:52 i satisfied with the result uh does it
51:55 work or does it break apart
51:57 uh things like this and then about notes
52:00 is when i try something new i try to
52:03 document everything what i do because i
52:05 know the next day i wake up i will not
52:07 remember anything from this
52:09 and then yeah
52:10 sometimes my bash keeps the history
52:13 sometimes i can just go up and see what
52:15 the comments but this is very unreliable
52:18 so often when i close my terminal all
52:21 the comments that i put are gone i don't
52:23 know why it happens but i do not rely on
52:25 that i put i would create like a
52:27 readme.md file or i would open a google
52:30 document or notion recently i have been
52:33 using notion for that and i would just
52:35 copy paste like from the terminal the
52:38 commands there
52:40 sometimes i would take screenshots with
52:42 errors and then would post there
52:45 and then yeah i shared a couple of
52:47 tutorials like that so i had these
52:49 documents and then i put them together
52:51 as docs like tutorials public tutorials
52:53 and shared
52:55 um
52:56 yeah i have a couple of git github repos
52:59 like that so maybe you can check them
53:03 uh one more question from the slack
53:05 community and then we go on to the slido
53:07 um so dmitrios who's a fellow organizer
53:10 of super communities i think he
53:11 organizes mvl ops community he asks
53:14 where do you get your community related
53:16 ideas from yeah i know where demetrius
53:20 is coming from
53:21 with this
53:24 so
53:25 yeah
53:26 i did get a few ideas let's say
53:29 i got inspired from the stuff demetrius
53:33 is doing what was doing at the envelopes
53:35 community so for example the podcast the
53:37 format we have right now
53:39 of doing it live with the live audience
53:42 so today i think this is the first time
53:44 when it didn't really work well because
53:46 of the internet problems so the first
53:48 time in more than a year so i think that
53:53 yeah i hope it doesn't repeat on friday
53:55 when we have another one but yeah
53:57 so this idea i
54:00 borrowed from the matrix then there are
54:03 some ideas
54:04 like for example from java ranch which
54:06 is a java community so they invited book
54:09 authors to ask them questions i also
54:11 brought this idea so i got a lot of
54:12 inspiration from other communities
54:15 um
54:16 and perhaps also added
54:18 a personal twist to these ideas
54:21 for example the minis and the open
54:23 source spotlight
54:24 yeah exactly exactly yeah but mostly it
54:26 comes from uh
54:29 some from other communities like malop's
54:31 community
54:33 and
54:34 from people from the community members
54:37 sometimes people would reach out to me
54:38 saying hey i have this awesome idea do
54:41 you want to try it and then usually yes
54:44 let's try it and then there are very few
54:47 a few initiatives like that that
54:48 unfortunately didn't work out well so
54:50 for example about networking sessions
54:53 but somebody reached out to me saying
54:55 hey it would be nice to just
54:57 hang out in zoom and then we started
54:59 with right that it didn't work out
55:02 but yeah this is how these things happen
55:06 right i think we have the last question
55:08 for this podcast which is from slido
55:10 have you ever considered live coding
55:13 sessions or
55:14 coding
55:16 and commenting sessions
55:19 yeah that would be interesting not for
55:21 data talks club i haven't we haven't
55:22 really tried that
55:25 um
55:26 for yeah for ml zoom comp actually there
55:29 were a few office hour sessions when it
55:32 was live coding
55:33 so maybe check it out
55:36 but notice there's something
55:40 like something that we regularly do that
55:42 would be a good idea to try something
55:44 like this so yeah thanks for the idea
55:47 um but uh we are already doing a bit of
55:50 that so check out our machine learning
55:52 zoom cam for
55:54 office hours
55:56 all right so that's it for all the
55:59 questions is there anything else that
56:00 you felt that i didn't ask but you
56:02 really wanted to share with the audience
56:07 well i think i just want to thank
56:10 everyone who
56:12 have been with me all this time
56:15 who joined at the beginning who joined
56:17 uh half a year ago who just joined this
56:20 community
56:22 so you kept me motivating
56:25 seeing the community growing is awesome
56:27 this is a
56:28 really good feeling so thanks for being
56:31 a part of that and i'm looking forward
56:34 to the next into this year to do even
56:36 more of that so i hope i stay sane and
56:39 find sponsors and
56:41 delegate some of this work but i'm
56:45 i'm really excited about this year
56:47 so thanks for being a part of that
56:50 thank you to everyone who's out there
56:52 listening and maybe next year we have
56:53 another you know a review of how it went
56:56 this year and we'll do the same format
56:58 all right thank you everyone
57:00 goodbye everyone and thank you eugene
57:01 for interviewing me
57:03 hi guys my pleasure yeah goodbye
57:07 [Music]
57:17 you
