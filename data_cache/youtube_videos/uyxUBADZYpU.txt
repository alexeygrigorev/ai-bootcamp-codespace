1:03 yes let's do it
1:06 okay I am almost ready too
1:09 okay now I am
1:12 um so we'll start this week we'll talk
1:14 about biohacking and improving
1:16 productivity uh by the way do I say
1:18 biohacking or biohacking what's the
1:20 right way of pronouncing I think it's
1:21 biohacking okay so let me do another
1:24 another attempt this week we'll talk
1:27 about biohacking and improving
1:29 productivity we have a special guest
1:32 today Ruslan Ruslan is a data scientist
1:34 who lives in Berlin he has tried a lot
1:36 of healthy and not so healthy things to
1:39 stay focused and productive eventually
1:41 he found a bunch of techniques protocols
1:44 Concepts about our brain body and mind
1:46 that might be helpful to others in the
1:49 data community and today we will talk
1:51 about all these things that he
1:52 discovered and by the way Ruslan is
1:55 looking for a job so if you need an
1:56 awesome data scientist to join your team
1:58 your team you can find him on LinkedIn I
2:01 also will add his contact details in the
2:03 show notes
2:05 so welcome to the shortest launch thank
2:07 you so much it's I'm very excited to be
2:09 here yeah I'm very excited to have you
2:12 here today too the questions for today's
2:14 interview were prepared by Johanna Byer
2:16 thanks Johanna as always for your help
2:18 and before we go into our main topic of
2:21 biohacking uh let's start with your
2:23 background can you tell us about your
2:25 career Journey so far yeah sure
2:28 um so after the high school I went to
2:31 study international business management
2:34 and then I moved to Berlin and finished
2:36 my bachelor in in this field and did
2:39 marketing and I worked in several SAS
2:41 companies afterwards related to
2:43 marketing and it was more like of a
2:46 business side of things so I was talking
2:48 to clients and I was just very bored and
2:51 then I realized that I want to do
2:53 something more exciting for me and I
2:55 went for my masters and in my Master's I
2:58 studied business intelligence and
2:59 Process Management and I did some data
3:01 science projects and I completely fell
3:03 in love with the topic so after this
3:06 project I realized I want to pursue a
3:08 career in data science and deal with
3:10 machine learning models help business
3:12 make data-driven decisions and make the
3:15 world a little bit better through this
3:16 and that's how I got into data science I
3:20 landed a first an internship at OLX and
3:24 then I have been working there as well
3:26 as a data scientist and I also did my
3:28 master thesis about deep learning so
3:30 it's a topic very dear to my heart as
3:33 much as productivity and all the stuff
3:35 I'm going to talk about so yes
3:38 and when did you discover this topic of
3:42 biohacking and productivity was it
3:44 during your Bachelor uh degree years or
3:47 later or when you already were into data
3:50 science uh actually I've been interested
3:52 in that for a long time I just didn't
3:55 know that it's called data science sorry
3:56 biohacking and until recently but I was
3:59 always researching about some
4:01 productivity tips or mental models and
4:04 Frameworks how you can organize your
4:05 time because I was one of those students
4:07 who didn't study much during the actual
4:09 normal study times and then I would
4:11 write the papers before the deadline and
4:13 prepare in the last day for the exam and
4:16 I was always saying every one of us yeah
4:18 like so many most people I mean at least
4:21 yeah and I thought to myself after
4:23 another deadline that I wish next time I
4:27 would actually properly prepare and then
4:28 I thought how do I trick my brain into
4:30 doing this or what are the habits that I
4:33 should have in order to do this and
4:35 that's how I got into this topic and
4:38 then it turned out that it's it's not
4:39 just about mental models but also like
4:41 your health and some protocols you can
4:44 do to just help you in
4:47 doing the work you want to do in the
4:49 best way possible for you
4:51 yes so what are these habits that helps
4:54 you during your
4:55 studying and then later
4:58 uh yeah it's not just pulling in
5:00 everything till the last minute
5:02 postponing some stuff to the last minute
5:04 I mean I realized that I mostly postpone
5:06 stuff because uh I understand that the
5:10 solution I'm gonna create is not perfect
5:11 so if it's not perfect it doesn't really
5:14 make sense to start it right and then
5:16 once the deadline approaches you just
5:18 realize you have to do it and then
5:19 perfectionist perfectionism goes away
5:22 and then you just do it so I just
5:24 learned to work around it to be honest I
5:26 realized that if I'm starting a project
5:28 and I I'm not happy about particular
5:32 things that are challenging things then
5:34 I just need to give myself some time to
5:36 think about it and then accept parts of
5:38 it that are not perfect and then I feel
5:41 that I'm unblocked and I can just go on
5:43 and work on it so that's kind of my
5:46 ultimate hack for solving
5:49 procrastination for example okay so one
5:52 thing is having deadlines so this is
5:55 doing things almost last minute because
5:57 it helps you to fight perfectionism and
5:59 then the other thing is just accepting
6:01 that it will never be perfect right and
6:03 then exactly you have to do it
6:05 okay
6:07 um is there more to that or just these
6:08 two things
6:09 then should we finish our episode now oh
6:12 no I mean that's like genuinely about
6:15 procrastination but procrastination is
6:17 not the only thing right that I I was
6:19 trying to solve it by hacking so uh for
6:22 me it's also about how to stay
6:24 consistent in learning some things that
6:26 don't have that line for example right
6:27 or if uh even if there's a deadline you
6:31 know and you need to like Focus very
6:33 intensely on the subject how do you do
6:36 it like how can you help yourself to do
6:38 it and also uh going procrastinating and
6:41 leaving everything to the last minute is
6:43 very very stressful and not healthy so I
6:45 wanted to understand how can I have a
6:47 better healthier lifestyle and actually
6:49 work from my strength to solve the tasks
6:51 and do what I love so that's how yeah
6:56 and how is biohacking different from
6:59 like usual productivity methods like
7:01 having deadlines or having a plan or
7:03 having things like that I think it's a
7:06 bit more grounded in science
7:09 so so by hacking actually just the term
7:13 is a buzzword and it can be explained by
7:16 in like in so many different ways from
7:18 genome editing you know to simple like
7:21 going for a walk or taking a break from
7:23 the screen every half an hour so uh it's
7:26 every really like the definition that
7:28 you give you give it is can be very
7:30 different so the biohacking that I'm
7:33 practicing mostly is behavioral
7:36 um and I don't do like special drugs or
7:38 medicines but only vitamins and and
7:41 stuff that helps you overall doesn't
7:43 affect your
7:44 let's call it chemical State very much
7:47 so without chemical interventions and I
7:50 found that just to speak about mushrooms
7:52 today yeah no I'm not talking about that
7:55 today
7:56 I mean they're like really a lot of
7:59 extreme things that people can do so I
8:02 just want I mean when I started doing it
8:05 I started for me it should be behavioral
8:07 again so that I can create some habits
8:09 that can help me and it should be
8:11 affordable right and it should be
8:13 something very easy so that the barrier
8:15 to entry is very low and anybody can you
8:18 know can try it out see for themselves
8:20 if it's helpful or not
8:22 so that's kind of my approach to
8:24 biohacking and uh yeah I thought in the
8:26 beginning it's also just a productivity
8:28 tips and tricks and just general
8:31 knowledge about health uh and brain but
8:33 it turned out that this is part of
8:35 biohacking so and it's very powerful and
8:38 useful so that's why
8:40 that's how I got into it
8:42 so taking a break going for a walk uh so
8:46 these are
8:47 this considered biohacking in your
8:49 definition I think so for example going
8:52 for a walk is related to dopamine
8:55 production in our system and a dopamine
8:57 is a hormone that basically drives the
9:00 effort for us to do something and
9:04 dopamine is also a hormone that is
9:07 related to motor movements so when we go
9:10 for a walk we literally produce dopamine
9:12 that can later be used or help us to
9:15 like study and learn and work better so
9:19 it is one of the ways to increase the
9:21 dopamine in the morning and it has some
9:23 other great benefits like light
9:25 consumption
9:26 so it is a biohacking actually if you do
9:29 it in the right moments
9:31 what is this dopamine
9:33 we actually I think a few interviews ago
9:36 we spoke with Mike alexadat who was
9:39 describing his experience of going from
9:42 Individual contributor software engineer
9:45 to a manager and then one of the things
9:47 he mentioned there was that when he was
9:49 an engineer
9:52 um he would all often get this uh what
9:54 he referred to as dopamine shots he
9:56 solves a problem he fixes the back then
9:59 he gets a shot of dopamine and then he
10:01 feels good about this but when he became
10:03 a manager uh he gets like the
10:06 gratifications he was getting was
10:08 delayed because it's not him who is
10:10 doing all these things but somebody else
10:11 and it was quite difficult for him back
10:14 then I didn't really ask him what is
10:16 dopamine but now I have a chance to ask
10:18 you so what is this and how is it
10:20 related to what he was talking about
10:21 sure so first of all I need to make a
10:24 disclaimer that I am myself not a
10:26 neuroscientist right I just use a
10:28 general knowledge available even though
10:30 I'm trying to be a bit more scientific
10:31 about my research and conclusions and
10:34 look for Relevant sources I will try to
10:36 give you my definition and understanding
10:38 of dopamine so we have different
10:40 hormones in our brains that are
10:41 responsible for different actions we do
10:43 and dopamine is a hormone that is
10:46 produced in her brain on a certain
10:47 Cadence with a certain volume so it's
10:51 basically responsible for us doing some
10:53 stuff so us reaching a goal going for a
10:56 walk it's responsible for motor
10:59 movements in our you know in our body
11:02 so that's what it does it's different
11:05 compared to serotonin for example which
11:07 is the hormone of like happiness and
11:10 feeling good inside of your body
11:13 so if you I don't know take a bath for
11:15 example and it's very nice so you just
11:17 had some good food even though food
11:18 increases up I mean like the good
11:20 feeling you have in your stomach gives
11:22 you serotonin so it's the a bit opposite
11:25 of dopamine because dopamine is
11:27 something you need to do outside of your
11:28 body to
11:30 you know something from the outside that
11:32 keeps it up
11:33 the white does fix in the back give you
11:36 the woman
11:37 because you solve a problem
11:40 requires you to understand the problem
11:42 the journey it takes and then eventually
11:44 you solve the bug you solve the problem
11:46 your brain celebrates it gives you more
11:49 dopamine and
11:52 sets you up for fixing more bugs in the
11:54 future
11:55 I mean if you think about it it's really
11:58 grounded in like basic things like you
12:00 need to walk around as an organism to
12:03 find some food right so if you find
12:05 sugar for example we get a lot of
12:07 dopamine from having sugar because sugar
12:09 was not highly available for our
12:12 ancestors right so that's why our brain
12:14 currently rewards us a lot for eating
12:17 sugar stuff and it's the same for doing
12:19 some mental exercises as well I think
12:22 yeah interesting so can you tell us
12:24 about your journey into biohacking so
12:26 didn't you your University times you
12:30 were procrastinating putting all things
12:32 till the last moment uh but then you
12:34 realized maybe it's not the the best way
12:36 of doing this and then at some point you
12:38 discovered biohacking so how did it
12:40 happen and what exactly did you discover
12:42 there what kind of things did you try
12:44 there and how did they help you sure I
12:46 would say the first thing that I tried
12:48 that was very influential for me was
12:49 meditation
12:51 and meditation is a very good technique
12:53 to to stay focused and alert and it
12:57 helps you to strengthen your prefrontal
12:58 cortex so you would have a better
13:00 impulse control just prefrontal what
13:03 yeah it's a part of your brain that is
13:07 located like in front uh so prefrontal
13:10 in front
13:12 um and it's related to cognition
13:15 so definition is what cognition is
13:18 thinking so all the high level thinking
13:20 that you have like not your primitive
13:22 brain that wants to eat and sleep but
13:24 rather the brain that solves the bug or
13:27 plans vacations is okay talks right now
13:31 right so this is what we use now for
13:32 communicating I think so yes right now
13:35 in this moment yeah we have a prefrontal
13:38 lobe quite active nowadays it's
13:41 somewhere here right yeah so those who
13:44 listen to this not see I'm touching my
13:46 forehead right now
13:50 uh so yeah so I started with meditation
13:53 and that was very good uh I had a lot of
13:56 great feelings from it and it was I mean
13:59 when I talk about meditation I mainly uh
14:02 talk about sitting in a chair and
14:05 breathing and accounting to yourself
14:07 from one to ten and just feeling your
14:10 body so this kind of like meditative
14:13 State and I'm not talking about any like
14:15 spiritual things because I didn't really
14:17 practice that
14:19 so that was one of the things that
14:21 helped me a lot it'd be just wanted to
14:22 talk a bit about that so
14:25 did it not feel to you like waste of
14:28 time when you tried that like because
14:29 you're sitting in the chair and you're
14:31 breathing and Counting well you can
14:33 actually work on things
14:36 yeah well the thing is that our
14:39 when I think about our bodies I think
14:42 that we're not made to function to solve
14:44 bugs 24 7. you know we usually have our
14:47 own Cycles in life like we obviously go
14:50 to sleep and then we wake up and we have
14:52 certain time when we are the most
14:53 productive and then our productivity
14:56 goes lower a little bit so we need to
14:58 take breaks like there are sleeping
15:00 cycles of one and a half hours
15:02 so we would fall asleep and then we
15:04 would wake up and then these Cycles
15:06 continue as we go throughout the day so
15:09 you cannot expect that you would be
15:10 super hyper focused for three or five
15:12 hours straight you need to take breaks
15:14 so usually because social media is very
15:17 addictive we would take breaks of social
15:18 media but meditation is a very good
15:21 healthy way to get a break and it also
15:23 helps with learning a lot for example
15:25 because when we are learning something
15:28 our brain changes and it's called
15:31 neuroplasticity and the Brain Change
15:33 actually happens when we sleep or when
15:35 we meditate for example it's a protocol
15:38 called non-sleep deep rest
15:41 and this is exactly when the brain is
15:43 changing so if you learn something
15:46 meditation is also very powerful
15:49 how did you open your mind to try
15:52 meditation you just heard that it's good
15:55 yeah I just heard from a lot of people
15:58 that meditation is good and I followed
16:00 some you know CEOs of some companies on
16:03 Twitter that said hey meditation is very
16:05 nice you should try it out
16:07 um and that's how I give it a shot and I
16:10 use the different apps for guided
16:12 meditation I know there's
16:16 open source and it's called medito and
16:19 it's basically available for free and
16:22 you can just download and use it uh
16:25 there is going to be a person with a
16:27 nice voice telling you close your eyes
16:29 relax count from one to ten and stuff
16:32 like this
16:33 and it usually is like five minutes 15
16:36 minutes 20 minutes I did an experiment
16:38 when I was doing one hour meditation
16:40 every single day for a month
16:42 because another very famous investor
16:44 Naval ravikant he suggested to do this
16:47 it was a very different type of
16:50 meditation though but it was also very
16:52 helpful
16:53 how did you understand that it's helpful
16:57 well first of all
16:59 we it's it's about awareness and being
17:02 self-aware so
17:05 we have so many thoughts and so many
17:07 things happening with us right now
17:08 nowadays we have complete information
17:11 overflow we hear so many things see so
17:14 many things in Instagram like you know
17:16 in social media basically that having a
17:19 break to just listen to yourself try to
17:21 understand how you're feeling
17:23 feels like a very big relief even though
17:26 it's uncomforting in the beginning
17:27 because it's not something we usually
17:29 used to uh in my experience it really
17:32 felt like a relief and then you get out
17:34 of the meditation and you feel relaxed
17:36 you feel like you took a break and now
17:38 you can go back into doing whatever you
17:40 you want
17:41 they've been doing this for quite some
17:43 time right yeah I think I have like on
17:45 and off moments so sometimes I'm doing
17:47 it sometimes I'm not doing it and I
17:49 think it's also okay because I don't
17:51 want my productivity system to be like
17:53 punishing me for not doing something you
17:55 know I'm trying to listen to myself see
17:57 like do I have a resource as they call
18:00 it for it right now or not and if I
18:02 don't it's also fine
18:04 um but when I'm studying a lot like
18:06 nowadays for example I meditate as well
18:09 because it helps because it's too much
18:11 right you need to go through like
18:14 consume a lot of information process a
18:16 lot of information right so you need to
18:18 give your mind a break exactly I see and
18:22 that's you know some cognition happens
18:24 while we're meditating anyways so the
18:26 brain position is again learning right
18:28 thinking yeah it's happening while we
18:31 meditate as well just in the background
18:33 we're not aware of it and the Brain
18:35 makes sense of information we learned
18:37 and updates the neural network
18:40 okay so you tried meditation what did
18:42 you try after that
18:44 after meditation I there were like a lot
18:48 of topics that I've heard about but I
18:50 wasn't sure how scientific they are so
18:52 for example it's important for you to
18:54 for the thing to be scientific yeah more
18:57 or less because
18:58 um well I'm a data scientist and I've
19:00 always been a fan of scientific methods
19:02 you know so everything we do should be
19:04 verified you know blindly controlled
19:07 studies so it's like some good
19:08 experiments with a scientific base and I
19:10 wanted to do it not because of a placebo
19:13 just although Placebo is a very powerful
19:15 tool and this is maybe part of a mental
19:17 attitude we can talk about but I wanted
19:19 to know that it actually helps somehow
19:22 to increase and you know reach your
19:24 goals
19:25 so um I tried to find some information
19:28 about meditation and I saw that it's
19:30 indeed very very like supported by
19:32 studies reduce the stress helps you to
19:35 focus better and you learn faster and so
19:37 on and then I tried cold showers for
19:39 example
19:41 yeah I'm not a big fan of it right now
19:44 after gold now for cold showers
19:49 yeah and then I also try to have like a
19:53 proper approach with light for example
19:55 which is not many people know about
19:58 so uh
20:01 when we wake up we need to get a lot of
20:03 light and then when we go to bed we
20:06 should have very little light and I did
20:08 know about this protocol and I've heard
20:11 about it on the podcast
20:12 and I've been a big fan ever since
20:15 because
20:16 when we talk about health and biohacking
20:18 like sleep is the foundation of
20:20 everything
20:21 uh
20:23 so the podcast I'm talking about is
20:25 called huberman Lab podcast and there is
20:28 a professor huberman who talks about
20:32 light and he's a neuroscientist and he
20:35 says that if people would ask him what
20:37 is the most important factor for
20:39 productivity and for health across all
20:41 the domains he would say is light
20:44 and that kind of makes sense because we
20:46 live on planet Earth and we have daily
20:48 Cycles so our bodies as a revolution
20:51 adapted to the planet condition and we
20:54 want to wake up with the sun and go to
20:56 bed
20:57 you know fall asleep when the sun is out
21:00 and it means during the winter we should
21:02 go
21:03 sleep at three o'clock
21:05 it's a good one but no it means we
21:08 should get try to get more light as much
21:12 light as we can in the morning when we
21:13 wake up and just have little light
21:16 before you go to bed
21:17 how do you do this like just uh
21:21 the usual bulbs that we eat light bulbs
21:23 that we have in our homes are sufficient
21:25 for that or we need to have some fancy
21:27 set up
21:28 uh the main principle behind this is
21:31 that we need to get enough light into
21:33 the ice and it just happens to be that
21:35 being outside gives you the most light
21:37 even if it's cloudy outside because the
21:42 the glass on the Windows it blocks a lot
21:44 of light
21:45 and you can even measure it with your
21:48 phone you can download some app to
21:49 measure the Lumen inside the
21:52 home or an outside so being outside in
21:55 the morning is really helpful to get
21:57 enough light and this sets you up for
21:59 the whole day so it says your proper
22:02 cortisol and melatonin Cycles which are
22:06 like other two hormones that are related
22:07 to how active our body is and how sleepy
22:10 we are
22:12 so just being outside gives you a lot of
22:15 light and so that's why it's called
22:17 behavioral biohacking right so because
22:19 you don't really
22:21 take any mushrooms you just know that
22:24 your body needs light so you go outside
22:27 in the morning even though in Berlin
22:29 sometimes the mornings are really
22:31 depressive during winter you still go
22:33 out and then it gives you some light to
22:36 enough light to sustain you throughout
22:38 the day right yeah and it's about again
22:41 our like Evolution development we needed
22:44 the light to Signal our body that now is
22:47 the time to go and pick berries or hunt
22:49 or do the work and we are biologically
22:53 the same as we were 100
22:55 000 years ago maybe even 200 000 years
22:57 ago even though our lifestyle changed a
23:00 lot our biology has not so it in my
23:03 practice would be a hacking I try to
23:05 replicate a lot of like this natural way
23:07 of things how our body should function
23:09 you know in a healthier way and getting
23:11 enough light in the morning
23:13 is for example good interestingly if you
23:18 have a candlelight in the night it
23:19 doesn't so I would just say that if you
23:22 have a lot of light in the night then it
23:25 messes up with your cycles and it's
23:28 proven that like high exposure to light
23:31 in a in the night lowers your dopamine
23:34 level for next day so you will not be as
23:35 motivated to do stuff on the next day
23:38 so artificial light are not very good
23:40 and if you have some light it should be
23:42 behind your eye level for example but
23:45 it's it's behind your eye level how does
23:48 it actually so I'm sitting right here so
23:51 this is my eye level right so I'm
23:52 pointing at my eyes
23:54 I need to put something right here like
23:57 a small lamp below my eyes so maybe near
24:01 my laptop right where exactly I do
24:04 something so at any point of time if you
24:06 want to use some light it should be
24:08 below your eye level
24:10 so so that you would need to look down
24:12 on it not up
24:14 and then it should not be strong yeah it
24:18 should be very dim
24:19 and interestingly the candle or the fire
24:22 they don't produce the same effect
24:25 because I think our body adapted to
24:27 candle and fire so far but not too
24:29 artificial lights this should be a lamp
24:32 like LED LED lamp or like usual light
24:35 bulb yeah but just not bright one should
24:39 it be like white lights yellow light it
24:41 doesn't matter as far as I know it
24:43 doesn't really matter even though I've
24:45 heard about blue light being a bit more
24:46 like negatively affecting dopamine and
24:49 the whole cycle but as far as I
24:51 understand and no it doesn't really
24:53 matter I mean I think the most
24:55 the biggest problem we have is not about
24:58 the lights and lamps but it's about
25:00 phones right A lot of people go to bed
25:03 with their phones I mean myself included
25:05 and they would just have high brightness
25:06 and that is definitely not good for for
25:09 having like a healthy long sleep
25:11 um
25:12 so so do you have any recommendations
25:14 when we should
25:17 put away our phone like how long before
25:20 going to bed
25:22 um I would say if I'm going to bed at
25:25 like eight or
25:26 sorry if I'm going to bed that's around
25:28 12 or 11 like after 8 I should not have
25:30 a lot of flight
25:32 like if I try to follow a natural order
25:34 of things that you know the sunset would
25:37 be around eight o'clock then maybe after
25:39 that we do not want to get a lot of
25:40 exposure to Bright Light what about the
25:43 phone like how
25:46 I just decreased lightness on my phone
25:49 and keep using it or what they do with
25:51 this yeah I usually put it on the
25:53 minimum brightness I think for me it's
25:55 like the default level sometimes during
25:57 the day I just cannot see anything
25:59 yeah but during the day it's okay to
26:01 have a bright light it's good to have a
26:03 bright light in the morning
26:04 I just think about it like have a lot of
26:07 light it's healthy for you and then as
26:10 you go closer to the evening just have
26:12 less light and that's fine
26:13 there is a question from Lisa have you
26:16 tried out those daylight lamps can you
26:19 recommend any my apartment is quite dark
26:21 naturally and I was wondering about
26:23 those daylight lamps yeah I didn't I
26:27 haven't tried anything what is the
26:28 daylight slump maybe do you know yeah so
26:31 as far as I know it's the lamp that's
26:33 strong enough and that can imitate a
26:36 natural light pretty well so they are
26:39 using it in Scandinavian countries
26:41 because you can have time in a year when
26:44 it's very dark for a long period of time
26:46 so that's how you could kind of imitate
26:48 the sun I haven't used it but I only
26:51 heard good things about it that it
26:52 really helps I also heard of a alarm
26:55 clock that actually does not make the
26:58 sound but rather makes it bright in the
26:59 room so it's easier to wake up
27:02 yeah at least if you can maybe later
27:04 tell me how it is
27:08 um so for waking up I I don't like this
27:11 alarm that makes sound I use vibration
27:14 on my bracelet is it a good way of
27:18 waking up or
27:19 that I don't know to be honest I can
27:21 tell you that light is definitely a good
27:23 way to wake up this is how you wake up
27:25 yeah
27:26 and I also try to time my sleep so that
27:29 I would sleep like seven and a half
27:31 hours or nine hours and I've been doing
27:33 it for years since my high school
27:34 because we we have like good times to
27:37 wake up and not so good times to wake up
27:39 because our sleep goes in Cycles we
27:42 start with like light sleep and we go
27:43 into deep sleep
27:44 so I would usually just time my sleep
27:47 and wake up in between the Cycles
27:49 because it's the easiest so we talked
27:51 about meditation we talked about light
27:53 and then you said that sleep is the
27:56 foundation of everything right so we
27:57 also probably need to talk a bit about
27:59 that and like how it's it looks like you
28:03 put quite a bit of effort or at least it
28:06 looks like that to me to plan your sleep
28:09 you say okay I need to sleep at least
28:11 this amount of time or this amount of
28:13 time and it means that I want to wake up
28:15 at seven o'clock I need to go to bed at
28:17 this time right yeah that's how I do it
28:19 more or less yes so can you walk us
28:22 through the process yeah so again I'm
28:25 not an expert here so when it comes to
28:27 sleep cycles I would mostly speak from
28:29 my own experience but I've noticed that
28:32 um well generally the foundational
28:33 knowledge is that when we go to bed and
28:36 we fall asleep we naturally have a very
28:39 light sleep so we can easily be waking
28:41 up and then we as the time goes by
28:45 uh we would go into a deep sleep so our
28:48 heart rate would be lower we would have
28:50 uh you know slower breathing and so on
28:52 and um
28:56 um yeah and then as we go we stay in
28:59 deep sleep and then we go back to like a
29:01 very light sleep and we have a moment
29:03 that's called rapid eye movement phase
29:06 where we have again the blood pumps in
29:09 very quickly we breathe a lot and we're
29:12 ready to wake up and
29:15 this whole cycle from going to light
29:17 sleep to going to the deep sleep and
29:19 going back for me it takes 90 minutes
29:21 but I noticed for example that for my
29:24 partner it's a bit longer so if it's a
29:27 90 minute cycle that means I can sleep
29:28 one and a half hours three hours four
29:31 and a half six and plus one and a half
29:34 hours again seven and a half or nine
29:36 hours
29:37 and I noticed that it's better for me to
29:40 sleep one cycle less
29:42 then to sleep a cycle and a little bit
29:45 more so for example if I have a if I
29:48 have an option to sleep eight and a half
29:51 hours or seven and a half hours I would
29:53 rather choose seven and a half because
29:55 then I would wake up in the in between
29:57 the cycles and I'll feel good my body
29:59 would be ready to wake up rather than
30:01 waking up in the middle of the cycle in
30:03 a deep sleep and I would feel sleepy the
30:05 whole day so that's another kind of
30:07 little tip productivity tip I'm using
30:10 do you actually put any effort in
30:13 planning this or for you it happens
30:14 naturally now it's pretty easy to be
30:17 honest like I usually go to bed with too
30:20 much planning for me like I I in the in
30:23 the evening I'm tired I just go to sleep
30:24 and then okay now I need to wake up at
30:27 seven so I just put my alarm clock at
30:28 seven or eight or like six whatever time
30:32 I need to wake up and that's it
30:35 that's it otherwise you need to
30:36 calculate like okay uh now it's like 11
30:39 and I need to wake up at six uh one day
30:42 I need to wake up to feel good and then
30:44 you start calculating all these sleep
30:46 cycles and then it's evening you're
30:49 tired
30:50 I think you if you really want to give
30:53 it a shot calculating seven and a half
30:55 hours or nine hours is not that
30:57 difficult okay
31:00 it's just like one mental like I don't
31:02 know less than a minute okay so like
31:04 this is time now so you want to go to
31:06 sleep now and then you expect that in 10
31:08 minutes you will fall asleep then you
31:10 just take the time now plus 10 minutes
31:12 and then add seven and a half hours to
31:14 that time and this is the time you you
31:16 set up your alarm clock too yeah exactly
31:19 what if you wake up during the night
31:22 oh that happens sometimes uh then
31:25 uh I would again try to just fall asleep
31:28 maybe meditate a little bit calm down
31:30 breathe some fresh air
31:32 um because whenever it's if it's very
31:34 stressful you know sometimes I could
31:36 wake up at like five and then it happens
31:38 and it's okay so I would just try to go
31:41 back to sleep
31:43 but do you go to your alarm clock and
31:46 adjust it I think so yeah I mean how do
31:51 you know like if you will fall asleep
31:52 now or in half an hour in one hour
31:54 I don't know I mean it definitely
31:56 happened that often and if it does try
32:00 to minimize the light in the night and
32:02 maximize the light in the morning
32:03 because it will set you up for proper
32:05 sleep in the next few days and by
32:07 minimizing light during the night you
32:10 mean do not look at your phone because
32:13 otherwise it's probably like dark
32:15 anyways because it's not yeah that's
32:17 good but I mean like before you go to
32:19 sleep okay because usually what I also
32:21 noticed is that if you have a proper
32:24 light
32:25 let's call it diet right so a lot of
32:28 light in the morning very little light
32:30 in the evening
32:31 it would usually only show itself only
32:34 like one or two days so it's not an
32:36 immediate effect because it's something
32:38 that our body needs to be adjusted to
32:41 um so yeah if you have like this uh
32:45 cases very often that you wake up in the
32:47 middle of the night just try to have a
32:49 lot of light in a morning next day
32:51 little light before going to bed or like
32:54 almost no light and see for yourself
32:56 maybe it will improve
32:57 yeah so speaking about diet but the
32:59 usual one another question we have is
33:01 what about changes in your foot intake
33:03 for example do you have any special food
33:06 that supports your concentration and
33:07 energy levels
33:09 oh I'm pretty sure that well I can share
33:11 what I've learned about myself so far so
33:15 um
33:16 yeah exercise and nutrition is a very
33:19 very important topic as well because
33:21 it's proven again and again that it
33:23 helps with focus and productivity and
33:25 generally
33:26 feels good the exercise is a very
33:29 healthy thing it improves your
33:31 cardiovascular disease your blood
33:32 circulates better so you can do
33:34 everything better
33:36 um what I am doing in particular is that
33:38 I try to have enough protein
33:42 um because well protein is like a
33:44 building block uh amino acids that
33:47 create muscles and a lot of other
33:49 important tissues in our body and
33:52 also protein boosts dopamine as well so
33:56 what I try to do is first of all I was
33:58 tracking calories and I was tracking how
34:00 much protein I was taking every day
34:02 for almost a year now I'm not doing it
34:06 for the record for the last month or so
34:08 but I was doing it before
34:10 and I noticed that having a high protein
34:14 breakfast helps me to stay productive
34:15 for the whole day
34:17 oh can you give us an example of a high
34:20 protein breakfast sure it's like piece
34:22 of meat well meat I don't like to eat
34:25 meat for breakfast but I like to eat
34:27 cottage cheese cottage cheese yeah and
34:30 then the Greek yogurt is also high in
34:31 protein you can have some nuts you can
34:34 have eggs for example
34:37 um I mean soya and stuff like that they
34:39 also have protein what about cheesecake
34:41 is it a good breakfast
34:44 um
34:45 I don't know about that usually this one
34:48 is protein too right it has cottage
34:50 cheese yeah I mean I think it's okay I
34:53 think you can actually eat whatever you
34:55 want and if you have a goal of weight
34:57 less sorry of weight loss then just make
35:00 sure you eat less calories than you
35:03 consume that you need like that your
35:05 body actually Burns and then you would
35:07 lose weight and having a cheesecake for
35:09 breakfast I think is also fine because
35:12 it helps with dopamine too not only the
35:15 protein part but I guess the sugar part
35:17 contributes more to that
35:18 yeah that's true but then you will have
35:22 a lot of I mean this thing about
35:24 biohacking for me is a lot about
35:26 dopamine and how to manage it and I
35:28 would rather try to get dopamine from
35:30 solving bugs than from eating sugar
35:32 so why
35:36 why because first of all
35:39 I think it's kind of a bug in our system
35:41 that like it becomes addictive right so
35:43 then you get used to this dopamine shots
35:47 from eating sugar and then it's easier
35:49 right exactly so that's why you know
35:51 getting I mean social networks are so
35:53 addictive because they also trigger our
35:55 dopamine and that's why a lot of people
35:58 procrastinate and I don't know watch
35:59 YouTube videos or spend time in Tick
36:02 Tock forever because it's easier way to
36:04 get dopamine so having moderation in
36:07 these things actually help you to stay
36:09 focused on what you really want to do
36:12 and what you care about
36:14 what do you think about these protein
36:15 shakes like are they good
36:17 oh yeah depends on the shake I guess and
36:21 I am using one from time to time and
36:24 it's pretty good so it's like certified
36:27 and stuff and I'm also a big fan of
36:29 protein pudding that's like protein
36:31 pudding what is a protein pudding
36:32 protein pudding is a pudding
36:36 okay yeah and then it has like low
36:39 calories but high amount of protein then
36:41 it's pretty good
36:43 so I eat that for example when I see I
36:46 don't have enough protein for the day
36:47 and
36:49 it helps me a lot as well
36:52 here's somewhere that eating rice makes
36:54 you sleepy did you ever notice anything
36:56 like that
36:58 yeah like recently I just figured out
37:00 that the biggest skill of my
37:02 productivity is lunch
37:04 so I'm actually trying to eat either
37:06 nothing or very little for lunch and
37:09 then you know see I see myself that I
37:12 can do more and get study better and
37:15 just stay a bit more focused so that I
37:17 can later eat better in the evening
37:19 so if you have like a very I don't know
37:22 exactly the specifics and I don't
37:24 remember it but if you have a heavy meal
37:25 your body needs to process it to
37:28 transform it into the energy it's not
37:30 about tries but in general food I think
37:32 so yeah
37:34 so I guess don't eat a lot of food for
37:36 lunch I mean right yeah but rice also is
37:40 carbohydrates and they have sugar so it
37:44 takes our body resources to transform it
37:46 and then you know
37:48 well the the whole
37:51 process is a bit complicated but it's
37:53 basically
37:54 after you have a lot of sugar stuff you
37:57 have a sugar drop as well in your blood
38:00 and that's where you feel like a little
38:01 bit slow and fatigue and tired so that
38:03 could be related to Rice
38:07 now I don't think I ever measured that I
38:10 just see Thrice and then
38:12 I don't really know if it's rice that
38:14 contributed to my low energy level or
38:17 lack of sleep or uh you know lack of sun
38:21 or whatever
38:23 yeah okay is there maybe it's like um we
38:26 can talk about this attribution models
38:28 right so how do you actually know that
38:30 they think you're doing the diet that
38:32 you have uh actually contributes to your
38:35 productivity or something else like how
38:38 do you know that
38:39 that's the science part you mentioned at
38:41 the beginning right you just believe it
38:42 yeah well when it comes to weight loss
38:45 for example I was measuring myself all
38:47 the time and I was awaiting myself every
38:51 single day and I was also taking
38:52 pictures so I could just see if it works
38:54 or not you know Based on data when it
38:57 comes to productivity it's a little bit
38:59 harder to to track it I know that some
39:02 people have the apps that ask you how
39:03 are you feeling today so you can just
39:05 have blogs you know of your you know you
39:08 can basically give different ratings for
39:10 yourself five stars I feel amazing I
39:12 could you know win the whole world or
39:15 something and then if you another day
39:16 you just feel low I haven't been
39:18 tracking that in terms of productivity
39:20 but I have you know a self-awareness and
39:23 I can just sometimes see that you know I
39:26 did a lot today and it was a great day
39:28 and that's how I track it myself so how
39:30 do you understand what actually
39:31 contributed to having a good day and
39:33 doing all the things during the day
39:37 well I see if I introduce the new habit
39:39 for example
39:41 like last year I had a lot of migraines
39:43 so I was also tracking if I you know and
39:47 I have theories why my migraine is
39:49 happening so I was having logs every day
39:52 if I have migraine or not and if I
39:54 didn't so if I did have migraines I
39:56 would write down why it might happen so
39:58 I noticed going for walks for example
40:00 and taking a break from my screens
40:02 helped me to have less migraines
40:05 and yeah I so I don't have a ultimate
40:09 productivity tip how to track your
40:11 productivity levels but I think you can
40:13 just assess it yourself and try to
40:16 okay but the core like the main point
40:19 here is I guess you just need to somehow
40:22 capture this data
40:24 track this data if you don't then yeah
40:27 you don't really know what's up
40:29 that's true I think that's it's uh
40:33 because for data scientists sounds
40:35 natural right yeah it's uh it's not as
40:39 easy as collecting clicks on the website
40:41 right yeah that's true like whenever
40:45 yeah when I was doing weight loss and
40:47 counting calories I had to measure
40:49 everything I eat or like estimate it and
40:51 that was a lot of effort uh but you know
40:55 what we get used to stuff and actually
40:57 if you have some routines and if you
40:59 think it's really important for you uh
41:01 tracking it calculating how much time it
41:03 takes is not really such a big effort
41:05 you know we are doing so much more
41:07 effort for so many other things and when
41:10 something becomes a habit you don't
41:11 really think about it you just do it so
41:13 it's also a power of habits
41:16 I'm curious uh were there any things
41:19 that you tried but you think they didn't
41:21 help
41:23 uh yeah for example intermittent fasting
41:26 is a thing that helps to stay alert so
41:31 if you want to study and you want to
41:33 learn something you need to be alert so
41:35 fully awake the intermediate fasting
41:38 means that you do not eat for a couple
41:39 of days no it means that you do not
41:42 so if you take 24 hours in a day it
41:46 means that let's say 18 hours most part
41:48 of the day you don't eat and then you
41:49 only eat within one window of the day so
41:52 let's say basically you can eat once per
41:55 day or twice per day but only in those
41:57 four hours or like six hours eight hours
41:59 so I tried that for example and I saw I
42:02 tried it for two weeks which I think is
42:03 long enough and I just noticed that I
42:06 have headaches it just doesn't work for
42:07 me maybe I should stick to it a bit
42:10 longer but I haven't maybe I'll give it
42:12 another shot but if you have headaches
42:14 it kind of makes it difficult to stick
42:15 longer yeah
42:17 yeah exactly that's why I didn't
42:20 and I think it's also okay
42:22 um not everything has to work for you
42:26 me
42:31 um no not really like
42:34 well I for sure tried
42:37 cold showers once or maybe twice I did
42:40 not like it
42:42 I think because uh sometimes you go to
42:44 LinkedIn and you see posts like okay I
42:46 wake up at 5am and then the first thing
42:49 I do is uh get in a cold shower then I
42:51 run then I spend time with my family and
42:54 I feel so awesome be like me be awesome
42:57 too and then okay maybe I should try
42:59 cold showers too
43:01 I just thought I don't know a little bit
43:05 I guess it's just too cold
43:08 other things he also mentioned sleeping
43:12 like this uh Cycles right I don't think
43:14 I tried that light definitely not
43:17 yeah I don't think I tried anything of
43:19 what you mentioned okay it's a lot of
43:21 things to try
43:23 cool
43:25 yeah the thing about you know cold
43:27 showers and some other stuff that's
43:29 clearly giving you discomfort I think I
43:32 I'm actually a bit biased towards trying
43:34 such things you know and limiting myself
43:35 maybe it's also related to stoicism and
43:38 this idea of voluntary discomfort that
43:40 we have so many things around us
43:42 nowadays that you know you can just eat
43:45 sugar and sugar and sugar and have
43:46 dopamine all the time and it's good to
43:49 just sometimes you know stay away from
43:51 it to kind of well scientifically to
43:54 reset your dopamine levels and have like
43:57 a weekend without document or just to
44:00 take something that you like about life
44:02 away from you just to see how it is
44:04 without
44:05 it
44:07 um and I just personally like why would
44:09 you do this like
44:11 like I don't know if you eat if you like
44:13 cheese you just okay let's see how life
44:16 is without cheese and then yeah you do
44:19 this for one month and then you realize
44:21 that life sucks without you soon you
44:23 start eating cheese again
44:25 I don't know I have a I have a
44:28 like this I like the idea that I can
44:31 actually overcome difficulties in my
44:33 life and then you artificially create
44:35 them right yeah sometimes just to test
44:37 myself I mean I like these different
44:39 challenges you know I had a month
44:41 without sugar last time this month I'm
44:43 doing a month without carbonated drinks
44:46 for example so because I like carbonated
44:49 drinks so you know this kind of stuff
44:52 sometimes for me it's fun I do it just
44:54 for fun to test myself but I imagine
44:56 that it could be boring or discomfort so
45:00 if I want to see the effect of cold
45:03 towers for how long do I need to take
45:04 them and to overcome my resistance to
45:08 like to overcome my discomfort
45:12 as long as you want but if I don't
45:15 then just don't do it ah okay that's
45:19 good it's that simple yeah I mean nobody
45:22 forces you to do any of this right it's
45:24 just like I want to be productive like
45:26 these people on LinkedIn
45:28 I think you should be productive as much
45:31 as you want yourself to be so I'll set
45:34 my goal to be somebody else but just
45:37 like see yourself and where you want to
45:38 be and what you want to be like and then
45:41 just work towards that I think that's a
45:43 bit more healthy and more sustainable
45:45 way
45:46 okay
45:48 are there any risks of biohacking
45:51 yeah I guess
45:54 um as I said I'm not willing to try any
45:57 stuff for example related to like drugs
46:00 and medicines that hasn't been tested on
46:03 humans
46:04 uh but a lot of people do a lot of
46:06 self-experimentation like I'm not doing
46:09 that because I think I would rather do
46:10 something that's safe and feels a bit
46:12 more natural in the beginning and then
46:14 if I see that I want to do even more
46:17 then I you know I would go for something
46:19 else so I mean the stuff that I talked
46:22 about looking at the sun you know in the
46:25 morning is pretty safe measuring how
46:28 much you sleep is also pretty safe
46:29 because you should sleep enough more
46:31 than seven hours more than eight hours
46:33 I mean eating less sugar is also pretty
46:36 safe right but in eating enough protein
46:41 yeah of course so uh I think try to be
46:46 cautious about what you do and try to
46:48 find like literature some credible
46:50 sources that would tell you if it's
46:52 healthy or not consult with your doctor
46:55 if you
46:56 um if you're not sure about something
46:57 because some people have conditions for
46:59 example intermittent fasting doesn't
47:01 work on some push you know some
47:03 percentage of people because they have
47:05 some conditions and it might be even
47:07 dangerous
47:08 so it's a good idea to check with the
47:11 doctor okay
47:13 what do you think about coffee and tea
47:14 like are they helpful for productivity
47:17 yeah like what do you consider it is
47:21 yes coffee helps to increase alertness
47:26 and remove sleepiness because it blocks
47:29 receptor of the hormone I cannot recall
47:32 right now but it helps you to be less
47:34 sleepy basically and the only like issue
47:37 with the coffin is that it can again
47:40 reduce sleepiness and you would not fall
47:42 asleep well so you you would it would
47:44 mess up your sleep cycles and the
47:46 general recommendation is not to have
47:48 coffee after like 2 pm you know or maybe
47:50 after 12. I think
47:53 everybody is different in how sensitive
47:55 they are to one thing or another
47:57 so when you hear like sleep seven and a
48:00 half hours you know for my girlfriend it
48:02 would be actually be eight and then you
48:05 know I can drink some something with
48:06 coffee in at like 3 P.M and I'll be fine
48:09 but for some other people it could be
48:10 you know even 4 pm or 2 p.m but I think
48:14 coffee generally is not bad it's a good
48:16 stimulant and it can help you
48:20 okay so we have quite a few questions so
48:22 maybe we should go through them one
48:25 interesting one is how do you measure
48:27 productivity
48:29 yeah as I said I'm not that good at
48:31 measuring my productivity I can just you
48:34 know self-reflect at the end of the day
48:36 did I do a lot or not and
48:38 that's how I do it I mean just open a
48:41 spreadsheet and then for each day you
48:43 know like do they do a lot yes no or
48:46 yeah like I did later I did a moderate
48:49 amount I did a lot right
48:51 yeah I I was um having like this
48:55 dashboard for myself a notion when I
48:58 would write down all the
48:59 all the habits that I was trying to
49:01 learn
49:03 um and I was also tracking like you know
49:05 if I had a productive day or not but
49:07 again I didn't really stick with that
49:08 and I'm pretty sure the apps that you
49:10 can use to track your productivity
49:12 uh I think I would rather just look at
49:15 my general feeling uh you know do I feel
49:18 did I feel productive or not did I have
49:20 a lot of distractions or not could I
49:22 stick to what I was doing or not and for
49:24 me that's enough so
49:27 so I would answer it just curious what
49:30 were some of these habits uh in your
49:32 notion document that you wanted to try
49:35 well I can look it up but it was
49:37 definitely doing sports uh drinking
49:40 water
49:41 um and I think walking a certain number
49:44 of steps a day because I would just have
49:48 I was sitting a lot and
49:51 I tried to go for walks more to just
49:53 move my body so I was checking that
49:56 so just these simple things and then you
49:58 would in your notion you would note that
50:01 okay like I was this day I walked my
50:03 target level of steps and I felt good or
50:06 whatever right yeah
50:08 oh my God I mean I think also measuring
50:12 stuff you want to change well obviously
50:14 it's important if you can't measure it
50:16 you cannot change it I I think like
50:19 measuring it not necessarily externally
50:20 somewhere but just in your brain you
50:22 know did I feel productive is enough for
50:24 some things but when it comes to Habit
50:26 tracking uh I think this is a really
50:28 powerful tool you know if you can tie
50:31 your results to some particular things
50:32 in weight loss it was tremendous
50:35 tremendously helpful for me I would
50:37 recommend you to do it and again it
50:40 might seem like it's some work and we
50:43 might feel lazy about it but if you
50:44 think you know I really want to do it I
50:46 really want to change it then it doesn't
50:47 feel like much and you can get used to
50:49 it pretty quickly
50:51 actually you mentioned this voluntarily
50:54 discomforting so if you're okay with
50:57 creating artificial challenges for
50:59 yourself then
51:00 and having fun while doing this I guess
51:03 it's also a mind shift right yeah for
51:06 sure
51:08 let's have fun right yeah even though
51:11 life without sugar might be a bit more
51:14 set
51:15 yeah you know this mental model of like
51:19 I'm gonna be good and feel good no
51:21 matter what and if there is a
51:24 challenging or like risky thing and I'm
51:25 just gonna take it as a champ as I say
51:27 or you know just trying to have fun with
51:29 it it's actually a really powerful tool
51:31 it's quite often also with the dopamine
51:34 and with sugar and everything it's
51:35 usually our perception of things that
51:37 matter but not the exact amount of
51:39 things that we take or we do
51:42 so the perception is really really
51:43 strong that's how our brain really
51:45 decides if we I mean I'm talking a bit
51:48 abstract but I hope you get what I mean
51:51 yeah it's like staying positive no
51:52 matter what if the world is collapsing
51:54 and I'm wondering how they actually make
51:56 you
51:57 how do you actually do this
51:58 like it's difficult like when you see
52:01 that everything is uh
52:03 how to say like not everything goes
52:05 according to plans and then you know
52:07 life happens and then how do you
52:08 actually
52:09 uh perceive things in a positive light
52:12 how do you stay
52:14 you know how do you focus on the good
52:15 things
52:16 yeah I think I wouldn't give advice to
52:19 stay positive even though the world is
52:21 done I don't think it's a good advice
52:25 it was a wrong conclusion
52:28 how did you say it do you remember
52:30 I mean I would say just be thankful for
52:33 what you have and build on top of that
52:34 you know okay because there is always
52:37 going to be some things really really
52:39 big and bad
52:40 or like small and bad
52:43 but there also can be good things so I'm
52:46 trying to be thankful for what I have
52:48 and then build from top of it no matter
52:50 how bad it is
52:51 okay
52:52 that's uh destroys his party mentioned
52:55 there yeah
52:57 okay do you can you recommend any book
53:00 on so it says like how to
53:03 do this mindset shift
53:06 yeah like there is a meditations by
53:09 Marcos Aurelius I believe who was a
53:11 Roman Emperor and he was a very Vivid
53:14 stoic
53:15 and that's pretty cool like even though
53:18 he was an emperor isn't it that's right
53:20 it's quite an old book isn't it yeah
53:22 it's like a thousands years old but it's
53:25 still very relevant
53:27 surprisingly so interesting
53:30 I think it was Marcos Aurelius who wrote
53:33 meditations I'm not sure now but yeah
53:35 Marcus Aurelius and meditations because
53:38 it could be and or
53:41 that's very good
53:45 um another question how do you manage
53:46 your time between professional and
53:48 personal daily life as an engineer or I
53:51 don't know if the and as an engineer
53:53 part is important here but yeah how do
53:56 you do this
53:58 um
54:00 I I want to say I measured pretty well I
54:03 tried to make a distinction you know
54:05 like if I need to do some I try to have
54:07 some work life balance but for example I
54:10 also want to learn some stuff besides
54:12 the job so I think it's
54:14 important for me to realize how much do
54:17 I want to do something if I really have
54:19 a desire to do it and then if I do then
54:21 I will always find time and energy to do
54:23 it so yeah
54:26 um
54:27 I think yeah it's if you want to ask how
54:30 do how you should manage your normal
54:32 life and like work life just have a
54:35 distinction first and see what you
54:37 really do what are your priorities like
54:39 I think last year the year before I
54:41 wanted to focus on five things in life
54:43 and just nothing else like nothing else
54:46 would bother me there are so many topics
54:48 you know that I always wanted to dive in
54:50 I could make a list of like 60 of them
54:52 but only five of them really mattered
54:54 and that was for example you know being
54:57 with my friends and family more often
54:59 and talking to them or like going for
55:00 walks doing Sports Nutrition and you
55:04 know being productive at work and
55:05 reaching my goals so I will only focus
55:07 on those and not try to do everything at
55:09 once and then if you if you feel blocked
55:12 that you cannot manage everything try to
55:14 find something that you can mention
55:16 manage and just do from it
55:20 and at the beginning of this interview
55:22 we talked about
55:24 um perfectionism so
55:28 and then he said at the beginning that
55:29 you managed to overcome it to accept
55:32 that it's okay to be not perfect and the
55:37 question we have is how did you change
55:38 your mindset to overcome reflection
55:41 because it's super hard for me
55:44 yeah so
55:47 I would say that perfectionism comes
55:50 from to overcome it you need to
55:53 understand two things and really accept
55:54 them first that
55:56 accept
55:58 that nobody is perfect and accept
56:02 that you are not perfect and that it's
56:04 okay
56:05 so accept yourself as you are and accept
56:07 others as they are and see your own path
56:10 in life
56:11 it sounds simple but I guess it's more
56:14 there is more to that than just you okay
56:16 now I accept and now my life is
56:18 different right so how do you actually
56:19 accept it is it a meditation part that
56:22 you mentioned at the beginning no I mean
56:24 I think it took a psychologist to work
56:27 with me in order to for me to accept
56:30 these things and understand them deeply
56:32 uh one exercise ID exercise I did that
56:36 really helped me I think is uh looking
56:39 at my past self and my future self and
56:42 talking to myself you know what is the
56:44 advice you would give to you
56:46 five-year-old so for you being
56:47 five-year-old so like for you being 15
56:49 year old or 30 or 45 or 50 and so on you
56:53 know how would you talk to yourself like
56:55 if you would look at your old pictures
56:57 you know would you tell that hey you are
56:59 not perfect you did this painting but
57:02 it's not perfect no you just really
57:03 accept yourself when you're young and
57:05 you know you have kindness and love in
57:07 your heart so I think if you try to do
57:10 this exercise look at your old pictures
57:12 um it's really really powerful and
57:15 definitely changed a lot for me
57:17 and uh
57:19 yeah
57:21 okay
57:22 um then another question is I was going
57:26 to ask this question anyways but since
57:28 it's coming from
57:30 so which book would you recommend to
57:33 learn more about biohacking anything
57:34 special for data scientists or ml
57:36 Engineers by any chance
57:37 yeah
57:39 um I would recommend not the book but a
57:41 podcast and it's called huberman Lab
57:43 podcast by Andrew huberman it has a lot
57:47 of episodes about pretty much everything
57:50 or a lot of things related to you know
57:53 healthy work of mind and body and
57:56 hormones and what are the behaviors and
57:58 protocols you want to do I'm a big fan
58:00 and most of the stuff I Learned was from
58:02 him even though I also were reading some
58:04 other books so if I would just recommend
58:06 one thing it would be this for sure okay
58:09 please give us a link but it's heberman
58:12 lab right yeah huberman lab and I mean I
58:17 as a data scientist was mostly
58:19 interested in learning in the beginning
58:20 how do I accelerate my learning and so
58:22 on what is what does the science know
58:24 about learning and all of the other
58:26 things so that's how I started watching
58:29 the episodes and the fell in love with
58:31 the whole topic and then extended it to
58:35 more areas you know like body and stuff
58:37 maybe can you also send us the list of
58:40 your I don't know top three or top two
58:43 or I don't know the single most favorite
58:46 one episode
58:48 yeah sure I have them in mind already so
58:52 I'll do it good so we will include that
58:54 in this one notes
58:56 um I think that's all we have time for
58:58 today we actually wanted to cover a lot
59:00 more that was quite ambitious but uh
59:03 yeah that was fun so thanks uh a lot for
59:05 joining us today thanks for sharing all
59:07 these tips and talking about your story
59:11 um yeah I have a lot of notes
59:13 um thanks
59:14 for joining us today it's my pleasure
59:17 and I really hope that even though some
59:19 of these things are obvious actually can
59:21 help someone to have a better life
59:23 that would make me happy yeah I'll need
59:26 to think how I can have more daylight in
59:29 the morning
59:31 that's a key takeaway I guess for me
59:34 okay
59:36 okay yeah thanks for this discussion
59:38 thanks everyone for joining us today and
59:39 uh
59:40 yeah I guess that's it
59:42 have a great day everyone
