0:43 interview okay this is the intro and now
0:47 I am opening the questions that Yanna
0:50 prepared and if you're ready we can
0:54 start yes
0:56 absolutely then we start this week we'll
0:58 talk about um Anastasia's career so we
1:02 will talk about your transition from
1:05 working as a physicist at tarch hron
1:07 collider to working with
1:10 llms and uh yeah so we have a very
1:13 special guest today Anastasia she is a
1:15 particle physicist who turn data
1:17 scientist she has experience of ring
1:20 experiments with at this large hron
1:22 collider and later at Blue yander where
1:26 she scaled a solutions for Global Supply
1:28 chains she also also let NLP and search
1:31 efforts at cand which is a very big
1:34 e-commerce uh chain in Germany and she's
1:38 also a machine learning AI Mentor she's
1:40 passionate about developing the next
1:42 generation of data science talent in
1:44 Germany so welcome to our show thank you
1:47 Alexa and thank you for your team for
1:48 preparing this podcast today I'm really
1:51 honored to be here and I mean I I think
1:54 I follow your podcast for quite some
1:56 years I even can say since then um but
2:00 it was always a pleasure for me to watch
2:02 uh your discussion with guests I'm happy
2:04 to be one of them today finally yes long
2:09 and of course yeah I want to join you in
2:12 uh thanking Johanna for preparing the
2:15 questions for today interview so thanks
2:17 Johanna for help so let's start with
2:20 your background so maybe you can just we
2:22 will talk about your experience in more
2:24 details what you did but maybe you just
2:26 can briefly outline I think I already
2:29 did that in in the intro but maybe you
2:31 can just briefly give us like a short
2:33 outline of your career so far yes yeah I
2:36 mean you already mentioned like the
2:38 major step let's say in in my way so far
2:41 um I usually describe myself as a mover
2:43 so I I moved many times in my in my life
2:47 in my career as well so like first of
2:49 all I moved from Russia to Germany
2:51 within Germany I also already moved a
2:52 couple of times um and and
2:55 professionally I was also like even
2:56 within my research career I actually
2:58 switched between three experiments from
3:01 my let's say research life so last uh
3:04 lar hron collider was the largest one in
3:06 the last stop so speak but before I also
3:08 working in multiple experiments before
3:12 um and when I decided to transition to
3:13 the industry um and where I also was
3:16 fortunate enough let's say to experience
3:18 also various industry and also apply my
3:21 knowledge I think it helped me a lot uh
3:24 let's say this experience I started to
3:26 collect being in the research by going
3:28 from let's say one step to another uh
3:31 but also I scaled this so to speak when
3:33 I moved to the industry and this is
3:36 where I realized my strength is and this
3:38 is how I know I can help other people
3:41 who may be not so let's say uh Brave um
3:45 to to start this transition but Al
3:47 really want this to do as a I help a lot
3:50 people to do kind of or be let's say um
3:55 more certain about the movement they
3:56 would like to the next this yes which
4:01 part of Russia you from um I'm from
4:03 Siberia so
4:05 from where
4:08 no okay I my knowledge of Siberia I
4:12 don't know where it is I'm from Far East
4:14 so we're kind of uh both Asian I guess
4:17 from which city are you from uh it's
4:19 near karov near karov okay yeah
4:23 unfortunately like I when I was living
4:25 there I had the chance you know you like
4:27 when you live there you always try to go
4:30 west right it sounds like like St
4:31 Petersburg and Moscow all this cool
4:34 cities are there so I always wanted to
4:36 go like more East but unfortunately
4:38 didn't happen and right now it's a
4:40 difficult to travel with so you moved to
4:42 instead of moving East you moved West
4:44 and ended up in Germany right yes yeah I
4:47 mean like many people with whom I
4:49 studied they moved to this you know big
4:50 city like Moscow and St Petersburg are
4:52 Usual Suspects um and I decided to go
4:55 like far much farther so to speak and
4:58 move directly to Germany I never lived
5:00 in well I lived in the big city in
5:02 Russia so in noers I started with um and
5:06 this is usually the city I tell people
5:08 especially if they never have been in
5:09 Russia because this is the closest
5:11 largest city and it's quite famous
5:13 especially in research because we have a
5:15 very nice re Research Center yeah and
5:18 the university is quite well known and
5:21 where in Germany are you in right now uh
5:23 right now I'm based in Hamburg I really
5:25 love Hamburg it's like I think it was
5:28 love from the first s so to speak so
5:30 yeah it's amazing City I was there as a
5:32 tourist like for 3 days but like it's
5:33 amazing it's so different from Berlin
5:36 though it is some We call we call you
5:39 know we have couple of places we call
5:41 them they look like Berlin because you
5:43 really yeah there's one uh there is one
5:46 I think I've been there like the the
5:48 buildings look similar like there's a
5:50 lot of graffity and junkies
5:54 and right yes no I love Berlin as well I
5:58 think it's my second favorite city in
6:00 Germany after Hamburg obviously yeah of
6:03 course uh yeah so we look we took a look
6:07 at your profile so Johanna did a great
6:09 job doing that and you have like great
6:13 it's extensive
6:15 intro and like there's a lot of things
6:18 there and you said um okay I don't think
6:22 I should read this but um so you're
6:28 you maybe let's start with this hron
6:30 collider so
6:34 you uh like I'm just trying not to read
6:38 this but like there there is no way I
6:40 think I can avoid so I I see that uh
6:43 like you saw you took part in very large
6:46 experiments with like a lot of people
6:49 working on this experiments so maybe you
6:50 can tell us more about that like what
6:52 did you do there and why these
6:54 experiments needed so many people and
6:58 and also I was always wondering like
7:00 what actually large hon collider does
7:03 like okay uh now we have a danger to
7:06 turn this into you know the um kind of
7:10 popular science podcast like I remember
7:15 so when the large hron collider was just
7:18 becoming a thing and people just like
7:21 when it was built people were afraid
7:23 that somehow there would be a black hole
7:27 yes it will create a black hole it will
7:29 absorb universe and yeah yes yes nice
7:32 nice Theory yeah yeah maybe why are we
7:35 still
7:36 alive this is a good good question we
7:39 asking ourselves every day um I mean
7:43 maybe I can first start with what
7:45 partical physics is right so because
7:47 when I usually when people say I'm
7:49 coming from research right the typical
7:52 picture that uh you someone who was
7:55 wearing a white coat and sitting in the
7:57 lap and doing something with you know
7:59 glass and put on some funny funny things
8:02 right so this image comes from chemistry
8:04 and from medicine um and in physics it's
8:06 so not true like I was never wearing
8:08 white CT when I was working there for
8:09 example right I was wearing some CTS
8:12 because I was working in the lab but it
8:14 was never white um and then um in in
8:17 particle physics it's essentially about
8:19 exploring the universe so to speak right
8:22 and how we do
8:23 this sorry it's very similar to what you
8:26 do as a child right so as a child you if
8:28 you would like to uh study something you
8:31 usually try to bring this apart right so
8:33 you break this apart and see what is
8:35 inside this is essentially what this
8:37 grown up physicist are doing this so
8:39 they try
8:40 to um kind of break things right and
8:43 these things are usually like particle
8:45 we know like proton neutron you might
8:47 recall this from your uh let's say
8:50 lessons in in school like but we are
8:54 like atoms and consist from some stuff
8:57 right so essentially we kind of take the
9:00 stuff and and um they accelerate this
9:03 because this is how this thing gains a
9:05 lot of energy and then we collide with
9:07 thing right so this is what Collide is
9:09 for so essentially we have two we call
9:12 it beams or two chunk of particles which
9:14 collide together and create new
9:16 particles or create something right and
9:18 essentially these particles are so tiny
9:21 like how can you when they like how do
9:24 you make sure they even
9:25 Collide oh now I see yes um I mean to to
9:30 to to keep on for short essentially uh
9:32 you use the um electromagnetic lows
9:35 right so you essentially kind of focus
9:37 with uh particles because they you you
9:41 you have a lot of magnets on the way and
9:43 this magnets help you to focus with and
9:45 this is like the strongest M magnets we
9:48 have on the planet I believe um so this
9:50 is to answer your first question and
9:52 second thing what I wanted to say in
9:54 this what I was doing essentially
9:56 looking what will happen after we
9:58 Collide this beams right so with the
10:00 particles and to do this you essentially
10:02 need a lot of cameras right so all this
10:05 huge things so usually when you see this
10:08 big pictures from the LHC you see
10:10 picture of a detector so this is like a
10:12 big camera um it's not quite similar to
10:16 what you have in your um mobile phone
10:19 but it has similar principles so it's
10:20 using some physical principles to detect
10:23 what's what what is happening inside and
10:25 register with right but um here you
10:29 essenti take a lot of pictures and you
10:31 analyze those pictures but and in the
10:34 past people did this exactly like this
10:35 so you really have like uh pictures and
10:38 you look at them manually right so as
10:40 you can imagine this is not really
10:41 scalable um and now it's everything is
10:44 done like semi automatically at least
10:46 right so you take all this data you
10:48 store this and then you analyze this
10:50 data later um and in terms of a scale
10:53 it's it's a lot of data I mean there are
10:55 like billions uh of such events happen
10:58 within I would say within a minute right
11:01 so many of them are not so many
11:03 particles that light or yes yes so you
11:06 really kind of try to push well I don't
11:09 remember exact numbers to be to be
11:11 honest but you really collect a lot of
11:13 data within a second right um and then
11:16 obviously you need some algorithms and
11:18 some methods to analyze this data and
11:20 this is why particle physics was always
11:22 like a front um or age field where you
11:26 try to apply with data analysis and all
11:29 with you know statistical analysis of
11:31 data and all things we're now using to
11:33 analyze for example e-commerce data
11:35 right they were used in particle physics
11:38 already for quite some time because you
11:39 you face exactly the same problem but
11:41 you have a lot of data which we call
11:43 events and you need to understand this
11:46 um this is why particle physics is I
11:48 would say very close to the data science
11:50 and maybe much closer to the data
11:52 science than some other fields but to be
11:55 honest when I was moving to Industry I
11:57 actually had a hard time to explain to
11:59 the people because most of the people
12:01 think you were sitting in the lap and
12:02 doing something with you know funny
12:04 liquids which is so not true for the
12:06 partical
12:08 physics liquids yeah okay uh so like you
12:13 said there are cameras and then like
12:15 there are particles that Collide and uh
12:18 there are billions of events and most of
12:21 these events are not interesting so you
12:22 need to find first out of all these
12:25 events you need to find the interesting
12:27 ones and then do some EX like some an
12:30 analysis on top of that right yes yeah
12:33 yeah right you analyze this yeah yeah
12:37 please no you wanted to ask something
12:40 yeah so like I was wondering why do you
12:43 need so many people like and how do you
12:46 even like I cannot imagine like for
12:50 example if I think about like a typical
12:54 company MH um typical compan is for
12:57 example company where I worked uh before
13:00 it had like I don't know a couple of
13:02 thousand people and then a couple of
13:04 hundred in the IT department and only
13:07 like maybe 20 30 data scientists who did
13:11 the data science stuff but like if we
13:14 talk about this large scale experiments
13:17 with as mentioned like 500 or
13:20 2.5 th000 people like how do
13:24 you like is it that much work and like
13:27 how do you even distribute this work
13:28 across Ross all these people and what
13:30 kind of work do do they do I'm pretty
13:33 sure if they would have more resources
13:35 they would hire more people because you
13:37 always have a lot of work and all people
13:39 kind of working a lot there right um to
13:42 answer your question there are like not
13:44 all people who are working with a data
13:46 scientist or close to the data scientist
13:48 to to be honest right so as you can
13:51 imagine with this very unique thing uh
13:54 also needs very unique maintenance right
13:56 and there is a big team who is just
13:58 working on hard where so to speak right
14:00 because all the things you building
14:01 there they usually don't exist somewhere
14:04 else right so you need the expertise you
14:07 have very we have very special
14:09 conditions you always work on the
14:10 improvement with things um this is kind
14:13 of a I mean there is a lot of radiation
14:16 so to speak right so you you need to
14:18 exchange this detectors which are inside
14:21 and so on which exposed to this huge
14:23 radiation dose and so on so it's like
14:26 it's never I mean it's I I guess it's
14:29 very different compare let's say
14:31 experiments in the space where you build
14:33 the detector and you send this so here
14:35 on Earth you try to use this advantage
14:37 that you can replace things and you
14:39 always have a lot of people working or
14:41 thinking about the next steps right so
14:43 this is a huge part of this team and
14:45 another part of his team is working on
14:47 maintenance and um like operations and
14:50 so on and then it's kind of split
14:52 between people who are doing analysis or
14:54 as as analyst you can have fun and it's
14:58 similar to Cinderella story right so you
15:00 can't have fun till you're done with
15:02 hous work so you also have some we call
15:04 it like service work which you have to
15:06 do to to make this detector operational
15:09 or keep it operational and so on right
15:11 and then you have a lot of system right
15:13 so what I describe like a huge camera in
15:16 reality it's several systems stuck
15:19 together they all have different
15:20 principles they all have to be aligned
15:22 and so on so it's like it's a lot of
15:25 work right so therefore I would say like
15:26 few thousand people who are working
15:28 there um they're totally justified and
15:31 then it's also about let's say many
15:33 people who are learning something there
15:35 right so I I I went to LHC um after I
15:38 was done with my PhD but many people
15:41 actually write in the phys St and from
15:43 Master you can even write a bachelor and
15:45 so on and of course you need some kind
15:47 of Supervisors and it's kind of you know
15:50 so you you have it's like training
15:52 machine as well so it's not only to do
15:55 the research but also training let's say
15:57 next generation of scientists well
16:00 that makes sense so there there's a lot
16:01 of uh as you said hardware and I guess
16:05 like if I compare this with what I said
16:09 before about my previous company I said
16:11 that there are a couple of thousand
16:13 people H but most of them work in
16:15 operations so I think it also applies
16:18 here right so you need Hardware you need
16:20 to maintain this Hardware right so a lot
16:22 of people work on that and also there
16:25 are other people who do analytics right
16:28 so maybe not all of these 2.5k people ra
16:33 rather have people who sorry it's a bit
16:36 interrupting on my side sorry for for
16:38 interrupting you um I mean you usually
16:41 never do just data analytics where right
16:44 where you usually have both rights so
16:46 part of your work is analyzing the data
16:49 and part of your work might be like
16:51 working on the next uh generation of a
16:54 detector right working on detector
16:55 maintainance and so on so you like um
16:58 you really try to kind of and most of
17:01 the physicist were involved in both
17:03 parts right so um you also have like
17:06 theoreticians we officially not part of
17:09 the collaboration but people who are
17:10 thinking about all the theories um and
17:14 regarding the data analytics per se
17:16 let's say or data analysis people are
17:17 doing where there are also many various
17:20 ways how you can look at the same data
17:22 right so because there are many theories
17:24 out there trying to explain what we
17:26 don't understand yet and and you need
17:29 like a dedicated team who will look at
17:31 this understand the theory and also
17:33 understand the detector and so on so
17:36 yeah okay so why there was this idea
17:39 that somehow this large hon collider can
17:42 develop can create a black hole and
17:44 destroy the Universe I think it was like
17:48 misunderstanding you know there is uh I
17:50 think there is a theory that it does
17:52 create the black holes but they're
17:54 really tiny ones and they disappear
17:56 almost immediately so you can't really
17:58 see them right so the the the reason why
18:01 we build this thing uh is on one hand
18:04 looking for the hi and you must probably
18:05 have heard about he bosone which was a
18:08 big thing which was discovered like 10
18:10 years ago and so on um but the second
18:12 reason that there is some uh let's say
18:15 material we don't understand which is
18:17 called Dark Matter and dark energy and
18:20 it's called Dark because no one knows
18:22 what is this exactly we have some kind
18:24 of from from our friends from cosmology
18:26 we have some confirmation it exists but
18:29 we don't really know what is this and we
18:31 were hoping that if we will have like
18:33 enough energy to create the particles
18:36 which may be substitute this material we
18:38 can understand this here on Earth so far
18:41 it did not happen unfortunately but we
18:43 keep trying all right and and I believe
18:45 if anything can help us when experiment
18:48 like this is of course is very very nice
18:50 let's say laboratory to produce this but
18:53 this is where it becomes very difficult
18:55 because to scale with even more you will
18:57 need even more people even more
18:58 resources it will be even more expensive
19:00 and there is like a huge debate right
19:02 now whenever not you want to do this
19:04 yeah to be fair this is not the only
19:07 collider on the Earth right so there are
19:09 other colliders which exist for example
19:12 I know in Germany right now where are
19:15 construction a new thing so if you
19:16 happen to be near Dad you can actually
19:19 visit the construction site where we
19:21 also Built Well it's not really ker but
19:23 it's also experiment where accelerate
19:26 the particles and investigate them and
19:28 so and you also have like I think like
19:30 500 people or so working
19:33 there yeah I think a year ago I went to
19:36 a planetarium here in Germany and the
19:39 session was about dark
19:41 matter and actually it was a German in
19:45 German so like I understood it only like
19:48 maybe
19:49 70% but at the end they were also
19:52 talking about uh hadon gliders different
19:55 ones and they were sh like on the map
19:57 where they are and I was wondering like
19:59 how did they jump from Dark Matter to
20:02 the Dr colliders and now it kind of
20:04 makes sense yes yes yes you essentially
20:07 can uh I mean like you build the theory
20:10 to explain what is this and then you try
20:12 to prove uh this Theory with like the
20:15 experiments in the lab and this is like
20:17 control experiments well to some degree
20:20 right so it's not fully controlled but
20:22 it's kind of your the best controlled
20:24 way you can you can think of right now
20:27 and one of the things you me mentioned
20:29 is that particle physics is much closer
20:32 to data science mhm Than People imagine
20:36 typically but you also had problem
20:40 explaining this because the image of
20:42 scientists that people have is like this
20:45 you know liquids and stuff so how did
20:47 you actually do this how did you
20:49 convince people that okay we actually
20:52 did data science we actually follow the
20:54 best software engineering practices and
20:56 these software engineering practices are
20:58 helped us um you know avoid creating
21:01 mess and destroy the universe like how
21:03 did you explain that right I I guess it
21:07 took me some time to actually understand
21:09 I need to explain this you know and this
21:11 is this perception when you're coming
21:12 from some field you don't understand
21:14 that no one else knows how it works
21:16 right so because you're surrounded by
21:18 people who know this um and you kind of
21:21 rubber have to explain what you are
21:23 doing right so like really doing like to
21:26 this extent right so because like most
21:29 of the time when I had the discussion
21:30 about my work it was like what we had
21:33 right now right so what you're doing why
21:34 do you need so many people and so on so
21:37 um and when you go to the job market you
21:39 actually have to change your story
21:41 and and when you need to understand with
21:44 whom you are talking and I think this is
21:45 was the hardest part because without
21:48 being in the industry it was not clear
21:49 to me what we're looking for and how I
21:52 can relate let's say my story to what
21:54 we're looking for so this is was the the
21:57 lesson I had alone let's say in the hard
21:59 way um and always think about the
22:02 software development right so what you
22:04 mentioned so essentially to operate with
22:07 huge F you obviously have a lot of
22:09 software right and I was lucky enough
22:11 let's say to be exposed to the best
22:13 software practices rather early because
22:15 this is was the the only way you can
22:17 control with many thousand of people
22:19 working on the same thing I mean it was
22:21 not like a monolit for all of them but
22:24 there are some monolith like things as
22:26 well like there is a software which uh
22:28 you to take the data right to store this
22:31 recording and to process the data and
22:32 this is obviously one piece big piece of
22:35 software for the entire detector and so
22:37 on um again back when it was not clear
22:40 to me that this is how you do this in
22:42 Industry as well right so with GitHub
22:44 Version Control cicd and things like
22:47 that um and I was also fortunate enough
22:50 with people who were thinking in this
22:52 terms and the experiments I was working
22:53 in but it took me some time and I think
22:56 only when I actually moved to the
22:58 industry I understood okay what were the
23:00 things which were actually were my
23:01 selling points so to speak uh from the
23:05 science and this is what I tried to help
23:07 with right now is a mentor especially
23:09 for the people who would like to
23:10 transition to the from Academia to to
23:13 Industry because this is usually the
23:15 thing we you struggle the most but it
23:18 took me some time to realize
23:20 this so you had all this uh you
23:24 mentioned GitHub CD right so you already
23:27 knew all that
23:29 yes yeah well I mean I I I maybe did not
23:32 know the the words the name for this
23:35 right I the verion control you know
23:37 right so and everyone explains to you
23:39 why verion control is important and I
23:41 also so old that I still remember you
23:43 know the thing before GitHub
23:46 um yes yes yes so it was and I remember
23:51 we had in this experiment I mentioned
23:53 before in Dad this is actually where I
23:54 did my PhD I remember we had a huge
23:57 debate whenever not with want to move to
23:59 the
23:59 G it was back then it was not clear if
24:02 it will be very thing right so and it
24:05 was just another version controller
24:07 system so people were quite against it
24:10 um anyway yes so like cicd uh I I I mean
24:14 like I saw how it is implemented and it
24:17 was actually implemented during my last
24:19 years let's say in LHC um I think I I
24:22 didn't know the term for this back then
24:24 but I understood the advantage and I was
24:26 quite happy let's say to to have this
24:28 because it saved a lot of headache for
24:30 us as well cuz you probably knew this
24:33 thing as okay you push and something
24:35 happens right but you didn't know the
24:36 name yes and when you have a lot of
24:38 things which is going on and and it
24:40 suddenly sends I think for me the first
24:42 time when I saw it it was like a magic
24:43 right so like you suddenly get email
24:46 which tells you what did you do wrong
24:48 right so this was like like fail tests
24:51 right or something like that yes like
24:52 fail test with explanation and so so
24:55 yeah it was really cool so you already
24:58 these things and I imagine also like
25:00 probably terms terminology that you use
25:03 in physics is different from the
25:05 terminology you use in data science and
25:07 you somehow needed to learn this
25:09 language of data scientist right to
25:11 absolutely yes yes with translation
25:13 let's say to a normal language right so
25:15 because you use a lot of jargon
25:17 obviously where are some things like uh
25:19 with let's say machine learning um in
25:23 the beginning I mean in physics it was
25:25 used for many years let's say the
25:27 concepts we using in in machine learning
25:29 um but the this the whole field was
25:32 called like multivariate analysis or
25:34 something like this because you analyze
25:36 the data from many uh Dimensions at the
25:39 same time um and obviously when I
25:41 mentioned I was working in multivariate
25:43 analysis since my master time no one
25:46 understood what I was refering to right
25:48 so yeah so like the language you also
25:50 have to
25:52 adjust right and uh like I imagine that
25:56 you come to an interview and you explain
25:58 how cool this thing is like oh Dark
26:00 Matter like B on hicks and Hicks B on
26:03 and like you know colliding things and
26:06 then okay this is cool but like what
26:08 does it have to do with our stuff right
26:11 right no absolutely I think I failed
26:14 like couple of interviews uh I mean
26:16 first of all I didn't realize how
26:18 serious is this and it's it's not just
26:20 conversation right but it's conversation
26:23 about some particular job in some
26:25 particular company and we're looking for
26:27 some particular EXP experience right
26:29 which you have to kind of show um I
26:32 think I was lucky like I mean back when
26:35 LHC was a bit more famous than right now
26:39 and also there was the situation on the
26:42 market was completely different right so
26:44 right now you have like many candidates
26:45 and very few jobs back then you had a
26:48 lot of like people in Germany realized
26:51 that data science is the thing they Tred
26:53 to hire people for this right and we did
26:55 not know exactly themselves uh what they
26:58 looking for and many jobs I interviewed
27:00 back when was really you I would be the
27:02 first data scientist that and where and
27:04 we were just wondering if I will be able
27:07 to do what we think data science can do
27:09 for them without knowing M data science
27:12 themselves so I think I'm pretty happy
27:14 right now it did not end up in the place
27:16 like this because I think I would fail
27:18 and it will be hard for me to recover
27:21 but uh back then I was very advantageous
27:23 and just wanted to move to the industry
27:25 and was going to every interview where
27:28 be invited so did I understand correctly
27:30 that you had offers to companies to join
27:32 as the only data scientist but you
27:34 decided not to uh no I did not have
27:37 offers I was invited to the interview
27:40 conversation they realized I don't have
27:43 capabilities how to do this um and
27:46 therefore I was never selected good for
27:48 me I would
27:51 say yeah uhuh and then you joined uh was
27:56 it blue yand or yes it was it a
27:58 consultancy company or what do they do
28:00 Blanda is a vendor for software vendor
28:03 for supply chain um and it's quite big
28:06 so I mean it's quite interesting company
28:08 so it started as a startup in Germany
28:11 built by the professor of physics so it
28:14 still has many physicist physicist
28:17 anymore but still has and I think this
28:18 is why uh they understood what I was
28:21 doing because we were also physicist
28:24 themselves um and therefore and I mean I
28:28 already learned a bit about the
28:29 translation so I think we saw that they
28:31 have enough business understanding so to
28:33 speak but we also understood things
28:35 which I was was not able to trans
28:37 translate back then right yeah um
28:41 actually before I joined this company
28:43 was bought by the big uh us company like
28:47 really a big software vendor um and when
28:50 this company was so much impressed by
28:52 the stuff is German startup was doing
28:54 that they decided to rename themsel
28:56 after the small startup right and so now
28:58 the the entire company is called Blue
29:00 yander which initially started as this
29:03 German company right um and this was a
29:06 really great place I must say so I mean
29:08 I right now uh after I know everything
29:11 in my well what happened afterwards I
29:14 would say I was really liky to end up in
29:16 the place like this you're still there
29:18 right no no I'm not there since more
29:22 than a year yeah uhhuh what do you do
29:25 now um right now I'm mainly mentoring
29:28 let say
29:29 Ah that's
29:31 cool okay well tell us about this so how
29:35 do you and maybe like first because I
29:38 see that there is a related question and
29:40 maybe you can also tell us about your
29:42 mentoring story but answer this question
29:45 because I think this question is related
29:46 to what you uh help with so the question
29:51 is how can we convince German companies
29:54 in this field I have many job
29:56 interviews uh and uh like it's a long
30:01 question like maybe let me try to see
30:04 how I can uh like I skip the first and
30:07 second interviews probably I think Skip
30:10 first and second maybe pass first and
30:12 second and then get rejected the worst
30:14 thing about German companies is that
30:16 they don't get feedback um when I get
30:20 rejected
30:21 if if they have experience uh on this
30:24 subject I'd like to hear to hear it so
30:27 so somebody Anonymous has a problem that
30:32 it's hard to convince German companies
30:35 uh they have many job interviews they
30:37 pass they manage to clear some steps but
30:39 then get rejected and get no feedback
30:42 and yeah so what should they
30:45 do this was a very good question I mean
30:48 in general in in Germany and in Europe
30:51 um people are usually very careful with
30:54 giving your feedback because they afraid
30:56 that you will sue them for this right
30:58 which is not so typical I would say it's
31:00 more like us thing to go to the to the
31:02 court if you're not happy about
31:04 something but still we we're very happy
31:06 um uh or let's say unhappy to give you a
31:11 feedback um even if there are some s
31:13 things um the best thing you can do if
31:16 you manage to build a good relationship
31:18 with hiring um person right so it might
31:21 be HR or maybe hiring manager you maybe
31:24 ask them for the call and kind ofont L
31:28 asked what what you can do better right
31:30 so for the short call like 15 minutes or
31:32 so um and if you went to let's say to
31:36 several stages usually they might be
31:40 let's say able to help you and and tell
31:42 you what was not not right let's say in
31:45 this case right so quite often it's also
31:47 has nothing to do with a candidate but
31:49 it's more like that we have someone we
31:52 feel would fit better right so and it's
31:55 like nothing you can do right so if we
31:57 don't see you as a part of a team um
31:59 it's not necessarily something related
32:01 to you but more like we picture of whom
32:03 they imagin to do right so therefore for
32:05 the only advice I can give here maybe
32:08 reach out to the person with whom you
32:10 were talking first and ask them if they
32:11 can have some time for and and talk with
32:14 you but don't expect too much we might
32:16 be also very work there might be also
32:18 some other reason like they decided to
32:20 promote someone internally and again um
32:23 like stop the entire process and so yeah
32:26 um yeah unfortunately like for the
32:28 feedback it's really quite typical that
32:30 you get just a rejection with
32:33 something very standard phrase and
32:35 that's yeah so I remember from my
32:38 experience working at multiple companies
32:40 some of them were German
32:43 um sometimes when you don't get feedback
32:47 you when the companies don't give
32:49 feedback it could be cultural fit or
32:52 Misfit right um and then like um cuz
32:57 this is a very good ground for actually
32:59 like as you said potentially suing right
33:02 cuz like you don't feel like this person
33:05 would Feit the team but you cannot say
33:08 this yes so you would be on the safe
33:11 side and not say anything saying hey
33:13 like sorry but like it doesn't work out
33:15 rather than say hey we think
33:18 like and then factual reasons because
33:21 like culture Feit and so on so it's
33:25 often behavioral question so I don't
33:26 know if these rounds um that you
33:29 mentioned have this uh but could be it
33:31 too so this is what I saw um even in
33:36 one-on-one conversations HR are hesitant
33:39 to talk about
33:40 this yes I mean if it's if it's clear
33:43 non non non Feit from cultural
33:46 perspective and it's very dangerous
33:48 topic we will we will never phrase it
33:50 like this right yeah yeah um they
33:53 usually will try to go to the hard
33:55 skills right and tell you you know
33:58 like you didn't pass this coding
34:00 challenge so like it's kind of it's as
34:02 objective as it gets right right right
34:05 yes it it also helps sometimes maybe to
34:08 discuss your experience with someone
34:11 else I mean who have not been at the
34:12 interview but just tell them how it went
34:14 and this is what I do with my mentors a
34:16 lot we usually do like a feedback
34:19 sessions even if I have not been in the
34:21 interview if someone will explain me how
34:23 did it go and how they behave and what
34:25 did we tell to this um question
34:28 sometimes you actually can feel the
34:30 question which went wrong right even if
34:32 your answer was okay you can kind of be
34:34 very hesitant um and then we do kind of
34:37 this feedback um session where we
34:41 discuss this and see okay what might
34:44 what the person might do differently
34:46 next time and usually it helps a lot
34:48 right so not only let's say mock session
34:50 for the preparation where you do kind of
34:51 a rehearsal but also like post uh post
34:55 more so to speak right afterwards like
34:58 talking with someone uh who has
34:59 experience in the field and can tell you
35:01 whenever it is acceptable or not and
35:04 refering to my kind of moving or
35:06 transition experience I mean quite often
35:09 you just don't understand that things
35:11 are working differently right somewhere
35:13 like it might be different country it
35:15 might be different field right so it
35:18 might be different company simply right
35:20 so having someone who is much closer to
35:22 this even if they not working in this
35:24 company might be very helpful yeah and
35:28 to what you mentioned behavioral part I
35:30 would say many people underestimate with
35:32 and it's usually the most important part
35:35 in the interview right so it's not like
35:37 did you solve the cordance challenge or
35:39 not but it's quite often about how you
35:41 behave how you present yourself how you
35:44 discuss some particular situation and if
35:46 you are not prepared for this part and
35:48 many people overlook this um most
35:51 probably you want to
35:53 pass and this is especially true for
35:55 people um that come come from uh Eastern
36:00 Europe cuz I think like for example in
36:03 Russia we put more emphasis on the hard
36:07 skills and we underestimate the
36:10 importance of soft skills we it was for
36:13 me the case I think okay like if I know
36:15 Java well then for sure this company
36:17 will hire me right and then they all of
36:20 a sudden start asking things like hey
36:23 tell us
36:24 about the time when you help your
36:26 colleague and I'm like
36:31 no it's true I mean I wouldn't say it's
36:33 related to the Eastern Europe person say
36:36 I mean I'm working with people all
36:37 around the globe and I
36:39 see to the kind of experience you had so
36:43 far yeah because like in University we
36:46 focus on like solving ma math problems
36:50 solving like programming problems at
36:52 least that was my experience uh studying
36:56 computer science that we just focus too
36:57 much
36:58 on um card skills but Overlook like team
37:03 workor and things like that at least in
37:05 University absolutely absolutely but I
37:08 guess it's not better in German
37:09 universities to be honest um still I I I
37:14 believe it's it's more related to The
37:16 Experience right so if you let's say if
37:19 you're in the beginning of your career
37:20 usually you don't recognize importance
37:22 of skills and this is what many people
37:25 say and I can be one of them right so so
37:27 skill soft skills the most important
37:29 skills to move excuse me to move further
37:32 um right because not how how good you
37:34 are in in in Java in Python whatever
37:38 doesn't really matter if you can't
37:39 really collaborate with our teams and
37:41 and and sort out everything's which
37:44 might pop up right and so
37:47 on and uh what do you suggest like how
37:50 can we prepare for
37:52 this for the interview first of all be
37:54 aware that behavioral part of interview
37:57 is very important part so don't
37:58 underestimate with um I mean behavioral
38:01 part requires some special kind of
38:03 preparation right so compared to the
38:05 heart skills um what usually helps us
38:08 kind of have a look at the typical
38:11 questions right so there are many lists
38:13 out there you can simply Google or just
38:15 ask chat GPT to prepare some questions
38:17 for you and practice them um and prepare
38:20 some stories you can tell right so it
38:22 might be one story I mean you don't have
38:24 to be very creative and creative stories
38:27 for every single questions you will find
38:29 in the internet it might be just one
38:31 story you use several times to highlight
38:33 various things right if you do it at
38:35 least once and this is what I like about
38:38 behavioral interviews um compared to the
38:41 hard skills which you always have to
38:43 keep fresh for Behavioral you need to do
38:45 this once and maybe refresh with
38:48 sometimes by just like checking your
38:50 notes for the stories you prepared um
38:52 and that's it right and maybe also think
38:56 before you go to the interview what type
38:58 of a soft skills they would be the most
39:00 interesting in so is it like teamwork is
39:03 it being proactive is it being
39:06 supportive right and
39:08 so so what I found helpful for me
39:11 personally was um interview questions
39:14 for Amazon so Amazon have their they
39:17 call it leadership principles yes and
39:20 they check if somebody is a fit for this
39:23 particular leadership principles and
39:25 they're quite extensive and most
39:27 companies at least in the E Commerce
39:28 space in the it space they have similar
39:31 things right so for me was um like when
39:34 I looked up questions for Amazon and
39:37 these leadership principles it helped me
39:40 also with interviews in other
39:43 companies so yeah that was something
39:46 that maybe for somebody will be helpful
39:49 and I think there was a book groin cine
39:51 interview you know this one yes I
39:54 actually never managed to
39:59 but like I don't remember how it's
40:00 called but like like it's quite yes yeah
40:04 I think
40:05 like seven years seven years ago there
40:09 many interview yeah so there's a clock
40:12 on the cover cracking the coding
40:14 interview so there is a chapter on
40:17 behavioral um interviews and they give
40:20 you like some sort of a framework like a
40:23 table that you need to think and you put
40:27 stories there and I think they also
40:29 suggest to use the Star
40:31 Format uh for answering Star Format is
40:34 actually quite contradiction so many
40:37 people say you can't really frame your
40:39 Tech experience and star which I don't
40:41 agree I think like having some framewor
40:43 is better than nothing because it also
40:45 helps you to structure your thoughts
40:47 right I mean especially if you answer
40:49 the question you are not prepared for
40:51 which will happen quite often right like
40:54 knowing how you can structure your fors
40:56 right so start is situation task action
41:00 result right and you just go mentally
41:01 from this map um and it's it's actually
41:05 amazing because even if you let's say
41:07 never told the story before um because
41:10 you structured was quite um well I would
41:14 say right so people will be able to
41:16 understand this and it will be a nice
41:18 answer right so yeah so like having with
41:21 framework helps where more than just
41:23 star but star may be the most
41:25 popular and you said that right now you
41:28 focus on mentoring right so you don't do
41:31 so how did you decide to focus on
41:35 mentoring cuz like I think it would it
41:37 was uh probably not an easy decision to
41:39 just okay I'm working but now I just
41:42 want to focus completely on my thing
41:45 right it's scary I know cuz like I'm I
41:47 was in the same situation when I was
41:49 working and doing data dos club and then
41:50 I thought okay now I just need to focus
41:53 on one thing and then you kind of take
41:55 the leap of faith right thinking
41:57 okay like fingers crossed it will work
42:01 let's see what happens and it's scary
42:03 like how did you how did it happen for
42:06 maybe to to be absolutely Fair it's not
42:08 like I imagine myself being a mentor for
42:11 the rest of my life right so it's more
42:13 like right now it was the right moment
42:15 right so and it was many many things
42:18 coming together which kind of push me in
42:20 this and I was very happy that I could
42:23 do this because um let's say my my last
42:26 workplace didn't not work out um and
42:29 having mentoring was helping me you know
42:31 to actually see some purpose still in my
42:34 life um and also help something which
42:36 can feed me so to speak right so um
42:40 however it's quite hard job I must say
42:43 right so like Al I I really like being
42:45 mentor and I really like help people and
42:47 I think I can do this quite good right
42:50 so because many people are quite happy
42:52 and working with me for many months um
42:55 still I believe it's quite hard job
42:57 because on one hand you are working a
42:59 lot with very motivated and talented
43:01 people right so as a leader let's say as
43:03 a team lead um I guess it's something
43:07 people dream of right so work only with
43:09 people who are very motivated who are
43:11 eager to grow who are eager to do things
43:13 you suggest them to do right so like uh
43:15 every leader will tell you this is not
43:17 what's usually going on in the working
43:19 place right so here it's very ideal
43:21 situation but on other hand you also
43:24 have this people who are constantly
43:27 challenging themsel and challenging you
43:30 obviously um and you always have this uh
43:33 okay I need to
43:34 do more things right so I need to think
43:37 this more um and and I need to kind of
43:40 prepare better for this right so it's
43:42 like you you never stop um learning and
43:46 this is quite quite common in our field
43:48 but you also always stretch yourself
43:50 right so in the stretching might be
43:52 quite stressful so you have to find a
43:54 balance as a mentor where you say okay
43:56 now I I know enough so I don't need
43:59 constantly you know upgrade myself to be
44:01 a better mentor and better um person
44:04 knowing
44:06 something how did it happen to you like
44:08 how did you start mentoring oh it was
44:11 rather accidentally I would say so after
44:13 I moved to the uh to the industry um
44:17 couple of people approached me and asked
44:19 if I can help them to understand how to
44:21 do this because we struggled and I was
44:23 like of course yeah because I remember
44:25 my struggles I was L to help someone and
44:28 make their life easier um so it happened
44:31 a couple of time and then some people at
44:33 my work when I was working at Bland
44:35 approached me and asked me like formally
44:37 if I can become their Mentor I was like
44:40 there is a word for this it's nice um
44:43 and when I was trying to find the mentor
44:44 myself and noticed that it's not so easy
44:46 so like if you have someone who is let's
44:49 say advanced in their career it doesn't
44:51 make them automatically a good Mentor
44:53 right so especially if they did not want
44:55 to do this and you just approach them
44:57 women they say yes why not but then you
44:59 see that it doesn't really work um that
45:01 well so I think this is what forced me
45:04 to think first what is mentoring and and
45:06 and how to do this and and what where
45:09 where value will be so to speak and what
45:11 is actually
45:13 mentoring this is a good question I
45:15 think mentoring is a way how you can
45:18 make life of other people easier because
45:21 it's not so you said like if somebody is
45:23 more advanced in their career it does
45:25 not make them automatically a good
45:27 Mentor cuz it looks like from what you
45:30 describe Mentor is a mentoring
45:32 mentorship is an ongoing thing it's not
45:35 just you me for a cup of coffee for 20
45:37 minutes and then like that's over right
45:40 it's more regular it's it's a process
45:43 right uh now it might be that you meet a
45:45 couple of times and that's it right so I
45:47 I would not call this person a mentor
45:49 but definitely the person who helped for
45:51 some particular questions right but yes
45:54 usually it is a process and here uh
45:57 makes sense for the mentor to understand
45:59 which type of a process they they
46:01 actually or what the goal is right so
46:03 maybe not the process because if they
46:05 knew how to do this we won't need a
46:07 mentor but the goal we need to identify
46:10 themselves like finding a job for
46:11 example yes finding the job getting the
46:14 promotion um moving from Academia to
46:16 Industry finding a job in another
46:18 country right and so on um and then this
46:21 this goal helps you to to look for for
46:23 the right person right so like if you
46:24 want to find a job in Germany and you
46:26 never work in Germany before you
46:28 definitely need a mentor who is working
46:30 in Germany or used to work in Germany so
46:32 we can tell you what are the special
46:34 things you have to watch out right or
46:37 how it works and what are the type of
46:39 companies you can see where and so on
46:41 right so so mentoring for the mentor
46:43 it's like sharing your knowledge but
46:45 quite often your your knowledge you
46:47 collected might be not enough so you
46:49 also have to constantly look like for
46:51 example with what's going on in the on
46:53 in the German Market um you have to kind
46:56 of look around because if you're just
46:58 working in one company it doesn't mean
47:00 you know or understand what's going
47:02 everywhere else right and things like
47:04 this so it's also being maybe more uh
47:07 kind of strategic um in your head and
47:10 and also find the motivation and explain
47:12 to yourself what is your motivation to
47:14 do with things now right um and coming
47:18 from physics I think there are two
47:20 things which are most important in life
47:22 it's like time and energy right and I
47:25 see myself as a he but to save both time
47:28 and energy right so or to gain some
47:30 energy to do things because if someone
47:32 tells you if you do this um it will
47:35 bring you closer to your to your goal um
47:37 it's of course nice because right now
47:40 there is so much information around us
47:42 right so you bombarded every day by all
47:45 these advices from random people so you
47:47 need to find some kind of Lighthouse or
47:49 some some guidance in this and I think M
47:52 can help with
47:54 this and um so there is a question and I
47:58 think you answered that did you decide
48:00 to become a mentor first or somebody
48:02 asks asked you for mentorship and you
48:05 said like it wasn't a decision to become
48:07 a mentor first for you it was the uh
48:11 somebody asked you and then you okay
48:13 this is how it it's called I like it let
48:16 me start doing more of it right right
48:20 maybe just to add here for me I also I
48:23 think back when at that time I I
48:25 struggled a bit with this I'm very
48:27 curious person I learning a lot of
48:29 things in my free time I do a lot of
48:31 courses reading a lot of books about
48:33 machine learning data science in general
48:36 um I I I I I was happy to go to some
48:39 events and talk with people and so on
48:42 and I just realize I have a lot of
48:44 knowledge I have no use um at my current
48:47 working place right because I was
48:49 working on Bland on the demand
48:51 forecasting Solutions which was very
48:54 limited I would say use case even for
48:56 data science
48:57 and I definitely could not use all the
48:59 knowledge I collected about something
49:01 else so for me mentoring was also a way
49:03 to share with so to find some uh people
49:06 with whom I can talk about this stuff
49:08 right so like right now I have couple of
49:10 mentors who are working on computer
49:12 vision or learning more about computer
49:14 vision and it's some field where I never
49:16 worked before myself um and it's more
49:19 like exploring this together right so
49:21 how it works and and and what you can do
49:24 there and um so your also said that
49:29 uh like I'm just trying to to remember
49:31 what you said but what I want to ask is
49:33 um so let's say I have a problem right
49:37 the problem is let's say I want to find
49:38 a job or get a promotion whatever right
49:40 and then I find a person who has done
49:42 this already right so somebody moved
49:45 let's say from Russia to Germany did uh
49:49 took part in a large hon collider
49:51 experiments and then uh I don't know
49:54 found a job in the industry right so so
49:57 I this person online and I'm kind of
50:00 already maybe on a similar path but a
50:03 few steps behind so I want to reach out
50:05 to this person and ask for help right
50:08 how do I make it interesting to that
50:11 person to actually respond CU just to
50:15 explain why where I'm coming from this
50:18 is sometimes I get request from Super
50:22 like super random requests on LinkedIn
50:23 hey be my mentor and that's it like are
50:26 you
50:27 like why do should I respond and like
50:30 it's such a big
50:31 ask right yes it's it's it's a really
50:34 big thing right so to be I don't know
50:36 you like it's the first time I see your
50:37 face in my LinkedIn
50:40 like no
50:42 sorry like how to like let's say if
50:45 somebody really wants to ask for for for
50:48 help for somebody like how should they
50:50 approach
50:51 it this is this was a very good question
50:54 I mean like there are two two two ways
50:56 to find the mentor right so like where
50:58 are paid mentors so I'm paid Mentor
51:00 obviously right there are unpaid mentors
51:02 and there are communities where you can
51:04 also find for the unpaid Mentor right so
51:07 um regardless whenever not you're ready
51:09 or or able to pay for this I would
51:12 suggest to look for the communities
51:14 first because where you can find people
51:16 who actually decided to dedicate their
51:19 time and as I mentioned before like this
51:21 decision for the mentor to be a mentor
51:23 is very important right so yeah there
51:25 might be people who just uh started to
51:27 do this and they suddenly decided that
51:30 this is important for them so they
51:31 wanted to be a better mentor and they
51:33 know people like this but most of the
51:35 people if you randomly approach them on
51:37 the Internet they might be happy to talk
51:39 with you once just out of curiosity but
51:41 it won't be very helpful and will will
51:42 be waste of your time as well as a m
51:45 right so like try to find this Community
51:47 First and they usually have some rules
51:49 what you should mention and how you
51:51 describe right so this goal definition
51:53 this is very important why you need this
51:56 and what you think is missing right so
51:58 and why you approach this particular
52:00 Mentor right so even if I'm paid Mentor
52:03 I still select people with whom I would
52:05 like to work because I know that I can't
52:07 help absolutely everyone right so I just
52:09 can help people to whom I can relate or
52:12 to whom I I I know I can imagine myself
52:15 how how I can be helpful in this
52:17 situation right so this description is
52:19 also important even for the paid Mentor
52:21 so who you are what you want to achieve
52:23 and why you decided that this person
52:25 will be a good fit for you
52:27 mhm okay and again coming back to my
52:29 personal experience when somebody says a
52:32 very sends a very concrete message
52:34 saying hey this is what I need help with
52:36 how about meeting for lunch next
52:39 week this is like super concrete and
52:41 then like okay I don't mind having lunch
52:44 and then like okay this is something I
52:46 can help with like one why not so then
52:48 when you make it concrete is
52:51 better as opposed to like hey be my
52:54 mentor yes oh absolutely I agree I mean
52:57 like if you just say hey be my mentor
52:59 usually you the best thing which can
53:02 happen to you people will not respond to
53:04 you right so right I doubt that this
53:07 this person got actually a good reply
53:10 from anyone um yeah yes being concrete
53:14 having some action so to speak right so
53:16 can we talk uh again don't ask for too
53:19 much time in the beginning because
53:21 people might be very busy so like having
53:24 a live conversation of course helps yeah
53:26 but don't expect too much time from
53:28 Wayside in very beginning because it's
53:30 also a bit um yeah we if we are
53:33 successful we most probably very busy
53:35 people by now so there is a comment I
53:38 see in YouTube that paid mentorship
53:40 sounds very
53:41 odd I I don't know like actually mentors
53:44 put time and effort to do this so to me
53:48 it does not sound out what do you think
53:51 like I I I mean this is very good
53:55 question yeah as as as someone who
53:57 invest a lot of time who thinks about
53:59 this a lot and so on I can't imagine
54:02 myself doing this for free I'll prob I'm
54:04 doing this sometimes right so so for
54:06 some people I actually uh did this for
54:08 free in the past I was also part of this
54:11 um non-paid community and so on um and I
54:14 know there are some disadvantages right
54:15 so there is a reason because if you pay
54:18 for something you actually take this
54:20 more seriously this is what I notice
54:22 right because when you say it's not like
54:25 I'm not abl it's for me so therefore I'm
54:27 not obliged to do anything and I won't
54:29 show up to our next go so if you pay for
54:32 this it's kind of you're like okay I'm
54:33 investing my money into this and my time
54:36 um you also become more serious as a me
54:38 this is why I usually suggest people who
54:41 would like to become a mentor actually
54:43 consider this option because it will
54:45 improve let's say quality of the people
54:46 with whom they are working so to speak
54:49 um yes and it's like on one hand I
54:52 invest my time on the another hand I
54:54 spent a lot of time in the past to gain
54:56 this experience right and I do share
54:59 this for free so to speak right so I
55:00 post a lot on on the LinkedIn and so on
55:03 uh but I do see the value and a lot of
55:07 energy it requires from me you know to
55:10 to be more personalized right to talk
55:12 with someone and help in their
55:13 particular situation and I think it's
55:15 absolutely worth it right but yeah if
55:18 it's not for you uh it's also fine and
55:21 as I said there are many people who also
55:23 share this opinion that mentorship must
55:25 be for free for whatever reason
55:27 happy to provide this some people I know
55:30 like inmany actually scared to do as a
55:33 paid Mentor because of all this tax
55:36 things and so on so yeah they they will
55:38 do this just for free because just to
55:40 avoid this additional um bureaucracy
55:43 stuff yeah yeah and also I think you
55:45 also mentioned that when you were at
55:47 Blue under people asked you to be their
55:50 mentor forly and this also something I
55:53 did uh uh at my previous company to elix
55:57 and this was a very interesting
55:59 experience like uh work-wise you get
56:02 more work but it's kind of unpaid in the
56:05 sense that you don't get more salary but
56:07 then you kind of still work so that was
56:11 uh pretty interesting so maybe another
56:14 thing for people to think about is like
56:16 for for example when it comes to getting
56:18 a promotion or switching like from
56:20 analist to data scientist for example
56:22 within the company absolutely absolutely
56:24 getting somebody within the company and
56:26 there could be already Frameworks from H
56:28 the HR department for doing that right
56:31 right I mean in the company you actually
56:33 get some additional benefits right so if
56:36 you're a mentor as you said like it
56:37 might be good for your promotion it's
56:40 also good for expanding your network
56:42 right so because you usually work with
56:44 people who maybe not some someone
56:47 directly from your team um and also
56:50 maybe with someone who might move to
56:52 some other department sometime if you're
56:54 working in the big company so it's a
56:55 nice way to establish relationship and I
56:58 think this is how in initially the
57:00 mentorship appeared right so it was more
57:02 like people within one company or trying
57:04 to find like uh people who can guide
57:08 them right and I belief is still worth
57:10 it even if you're not paid by your
57:12 company for this but if you look for
57:14 someone outside you need to understand
57:17 and I would definitely ask why we why
57:21 they decided to become a mentor right so
57:23 because if you don't understand their
57:25 motivation um it might be not clear for
57:27 you how far they can help you yeah right
57:31 and I remember I did use actually like
57:33 this my my mentorship experience uh
57:36 mentoring experience uh or my uh
57:40 promotion case saying hey like people
57:44 yeah I
57:46 did I was actually I did not do this spe
57:49 when but um at some point and we didn't
57:52 have time to talk about this but um I
57:54 realized that um like in blue yander I
57:57 will not have let's say as I I can't go
58:00 as far as I wanted or as quick as I
58:02 wanted to go very far I mean and like
58:04 mve to the official leadership positions
58:07 um and I was trying to explore the kind
58:09 of the world outside and this is why I
58:12 actually left blue yand eventually to
58:14 explore with leadership um um positions
58:18 and I think like having this Mentor uh
58:22 experience helped me a lot because
58:23 otherwise I mean I had was informal
58:26 um kind of experience right so I was
58:28 leading the team I was kind of leading
58:30 the project and so on but I never had
58:32 like official title like a manager or
58:34 something right so I was an individual
58:36 contributor and um talking about this
58:40 mentorship experience actually helped me
58:42 back when because it's part I mean it's
58:45 not like 100% of what you do as the
58:48 manager of a team but some things are
58:50 very relevant right so when people want
58:52 to develop and I think in in data
58:54 science and machine learning many people
58:56 people want to develop themselves so if
58:57 you come with this yeah I know how to
58:59 develop people I know how to talk with
59:01 them about this this is a big plus um
59:04 for many companies who will consider to
59:06 hire you without a formal leadership
59:09 experience so last question and then we
59:12 call it today so which communities would
59:14 you recommend uh where people can find
59:18 uh like un paid mentors or
59:21 Volunteers in the data science this is a
59:25 good um
59:26 to be honest right now since I'm not
59:28 like part of this community or not
59:30 active member I don't remember the names
59:32 but I guess in Germany right I I
59:35 remember like uh during covid times um
59:38 one like I saw it all over the place in
59:41 social media maybe we can link something
59:44 mentoring Club maybe I think it was M CL
59:47 I was just think Club is paid or unpaid
59:50 maybe not uh yeah so mentoring Club s
59:52 familiar I know Mentor Cru but it is
59:55 paid uh so you can find a lot of anyways
59:58 yeah Google is your friend I think well
1:00:02 uh we should rename this podcast this
1:00:04 interview because we like LM we did not
1:00:07 talk about llms but like we did talk a
1:00:09 lot about other things I don't know how
1:00:11 llms appear there but like not important
1:00:14 we will probably rename it to large C
1:00:17 collider and
1:00:19 mentorship and I want to thank you for
1:00:21 sharing your experience expertise with
1:00:24 us um so now I know what large hon
1:00:27 collider did well more than before
1:00:32 uh luckily we are all still alive and
1:00:35 not like the world the universe did not
1:00:37 collapse because of the experiments like
1:00:40 yeah yeah or you never know maybe it did
1:00:42 it's
1:00:43 just Matrix anyways so thanks a lot for
1:00:47 doing that and
1:00:49 uh yeah oh was pleasure talking with you
1:00:53 yeah it was pleasure for me as well
1:00:54 thank you Alex for interesting question
1:00:56 questions and discussion I mean I was
1:00:58 definitely not prepared to talk a lot
1:01:00 about my research career but I'm glad we
1:01:02 talked about this and maybe people
1:01:04 learned a bit more I guess llm is
1:01:07 something everyone is talking about this
1:01:08 this day so maybe LHC deserved more
1:01:11 attention yeah thank you for for
1:01:14 inviting me yes and I wish you and all
1:01:18 listeners and and Watchers of our live
1:01:20 discussion today great day yeah so
1:01:23 thanks everyone for joining in and
1:01:25 asking questions s and uh yeah next week
1:01:29 we have a break but then we will have
1:01:31 more interviews
1:01:32 so yeah stay tuned and yeah bye bye
1:01:37 everyone
