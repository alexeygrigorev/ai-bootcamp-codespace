1:33 actually
1:34 um so i didn't uh even like write the
1:37 script or anything like that i just you
1:40 know but yeah i did because they were
1:42 quite um some of the questions
1:43 especially uh were questions that i do
1:46 get asked by even my friends right like
1:48 because i'm a recruiter so um so things
1:50 about like salaries and what to say what
1:52 not to say so i'm very happy and i i
1:55 hope i can help people also to navigate
1:58 this
1:59 sometimes strange recruitment processes
2:01 and interviews
2:03 yeah so thanks for being here so this
2:05 week we'll talk about hiring data
2:06 professionals and we have a special
2:08 guest today alicia alicia worked for
2:10 almost six years at zelanda as a
2:12 recruiter with focus on hiring data
2:15 scientists i think in the london it's
2:17 called applied scientists uh at some
2:20 point you renamed it this but it was a
2:22 research scientist data scientist you
2:24 had a bunch of
2:26 data professionals so i actually met
2:28 matt
2:29 alicia
2:31 during a recruitment process as well so
2:33 she was
2:35 trying to hire me multiple times
2:38 and even though alicia no longer works
2:40 at zlanda and i think he maybe will tell
2:43 us a bit more about that you don't focus
2:45 on
2:46 data professionals specifically anymore
2:49 but when i was thinking who to invite to
2:51 this interview who to to talk to about
2:54 hiring data professionals i couldn't
2:56 think of a better candidate so welcome
2:58 welcome to our event
3:00 thank you so much thanks for having me
3:02 it's a pleasure yeah so before we go
3:05 into our main topic of hiring data
3:07 people let's start with your background
3:10 can you tell us about your career
3:11 journey so far
3:13 yeah um so i started over 10 years ago
3:16 in recruitment and like most of the
3:18 people i kind of fell into it
3:21 as i started working in recruitment
3:22 agency very small one and then i moved
3:25 on in-house so i became like not a head
3:27 hunter but internal part of an internal
3:29 recruitment team at google where i spent
3:32 two years hiring site reliability
3:34 engineers which was quite challenging um
3:36 and after that i decided to move to
3:38 berlin and i joined zalando i first
3:41 joined actually as a sourcer then i
3:43 became this recruiter and the last
3:45 couple of years i was also leading a
3:47 team of recruiters who are recruiting
3:49 data professionals and also product
3:51 designers um so that was that was yeah
3:53 my journey so far
3:57 and what do you know yeah and right now
3:59 i am part of we are king which is an
4:02 embedded talent agency so i kind of went
4:04 to the other side um
4:06 uh what we do is we go into companies we
4:08 help them scale their tech teams uh and
4:11 kind of embed it so you know do the
4:13 usual things that internal team would do
4:15 um and yeah we do this uh in berlin as
4:18 well as in amsterdam but really like
4:20 operating globally this day so with
4:22 remote work uh yeah
4:25 so not just data folks but uh any tech
4:28 professionals tech tech focused uh at
4:31 the moment yeah so i'm kind of in the
4:33 role of a client lead um also where it's
4:35 a bit more on a strategic level uh doing
4:38 project management and helping and
4:40 advising consulting uh different
4:42 companies and clients yeah yeah
4:44 interesting thanks
4:45 so um probably we'll be more
4:49 talking more about the
4:51 the work you were doing as a landlord
4:53 but i guess the process looks similar
4:55 not just for data folks but for usual
4:58 tech professionals as well so i'm
5:00 curious
5:01 what does the hiring process look like
5:03 what are the typical steps in the
5:05 process
5:06 yeah um so yeah a lot of the times of
5:09 course the process overall will depend
5:11 on the company
5:12 but typically what i see especially in
5:14 tech and and for data science um there
5:16 is some sort of recruiter interview
5:18 usually as a first one um not always but
5:21 typically um and then um there is a
5:24 technical screening like usually one
5:26 interview one hour long with a data
5:28 science interviewer um so that's much
5:31 more technical and then there is like a
5:33 final round of used to be physical
5:35 on-site interviews that were actually
5:37 that's why we called them on sites but
5:39 um now they're mostly virtual due to the
5:42 current situation um and in in that
5:45 final round typically it again depends
5:47 on the company it could be anything from
5:49 three or two to
5:51 five or seven interviews um so again
5:54 depends on the company and how big they
5:56 are also um
5:58 then sometimes this process may not be
5:59 as organized um or structured uh but
6:02 yeah after that um obviously there is uh
6:05 the decision round and then
6:07 and then yeah uh final kind of decision
6:11 and i guess even before that you
6:14 the process also involves
6:16 sourcing candidates or doing
6:18 cv screening right so this is the error
6:20 oh yes right of course of course so like
6:23 when i when i talked about process i
6:24 guess i just kind of explained the
6:26 recruitment or like interviewing process
6:28 but of course before that we even get
6:29 into that stage there's a lot of
6:31 stuff that has to happen before uh
6:33 beforehand um so first of course we need
6:36 to have candidates um who are willing to
6:38 go for those interviews and that uh
6:40 especially when it comes to data
6:42 professionals that could take uh take a
6:44 while and then of course after the
6:46 interviews there is another stage where
6:48 you know decision is made and if the
6:49 decision is positive like we want to
6:51 hire someone um
6:53 we need to make an offer we need to talk
6:54 about you know the conditions and uh
6:57 come up with a contract and then on
6:59 board by the person so yeah quite a lot
7:02 of work and
7:04 what
7:05 do you do in this process what is your
7:07 role in this process
7:09 yeah um so the rule starts whenever
7:11 there is a need um so there's a demand
7:13 and obviously also the budget to hire
7:15 someone like a data scientist or data
7:18 engineer typically a hiring manager so
7:20 this is this could be anyone could be
7:22 engineering manager could be a data
7:23 science manager but someone in the team
7:25 who
7:26 who can hire and who wants to hire would
7:28 contact the recruitment team um or
7:30 myself directly and say like i want to
7:32 hire a data scientist um can you help me
7:34 um so that's where it starts and this is
7:36 where we kind of have initial meeting
7:38 with the with that person to establish
7:41 what they're really looking for to come
7:42 up with the job description make sure
7:44 that you know it's kind of aligned um
7:47 this is also where there's kind of um
7:50 uh in during this process we out try to
7:52 establish you know why why do we need
7:54 this person um you know why are we
7:56 having externally um and do they really
7:59 need um all of the skills that are
8:01 mentioned because sometimes you know
8:02 there are certain expectations but
8:04 they're not always
8:05 what um what is available on the market
8:07 talent market is super tough when it
8:09 comes to hiring data professionals it's
8:11 not easy there's high competition so
8:14 it's it's also a kind of in a way
8:16 negotiation sometimes with the hiring
8:18 managers depending on the hiring manager
8:19 as to like what realistically is
8:22 possible and what is not um
8:25 going through the job description making
8:26 sure it's attractive that people will
8:28 actually want to apply to it
8:29 um and and and deciding what the
8:32 interview process will be who will be
8:33 the interviewers um that will take part
8:36 what kind of interviews we have to
8:37 absolutely do and which ones maybe we
8:38 could we could omit um and
8:42 if there is flexibility on that of
8:44 course um so yeah very kind of
8:46 nitty-gritty practicalities as well um
8:49 about you know everything
8:51 at which point the hiring manager will
8:53 talk to the people who who will talk to
8:55 to the candidates um
8:57 yeah
8:59 yeah so that's quite uh quite a lot of
9:01 things so that's where it starts yes and
9:03 of course then uh then there is a part
9:05 where um there is two there's twofold um
9:08 so with hiring data professionals i
9:10 think in tech in general it's a very
9:13 competitive market but more so from my
9:16 experience when it comes to data
9:18 scientists or data engineers
9:22 so we do obviously post the positions
9:25 typically every recruiter would always
9:26 you know post the open position but the
9:28 the number of applicants or what who
9:31 applies isn't always aligned and this is
9:33 where we can't rely on that because we
9:35 would probably never hire them and this
9:37 is where sourcing comes in so as a
9:39 recruiter a lot of the recruiters do
9:41 both um some companies um have separate
9:44 sourcing teams where there's people who
9:46 just source candidates and they don't
9:47 even interview them and but in what i
9:50 did actually in the in the beginning of
9:52 my journey at zalando was i started as a
9:54 sourcer for data science um and then i
9:57 became a recruiter for data science um
9:59 so yeah so it's it goes down to actually
10:02 actively approaching candidates or or
10:04 people who wouldn't apply because they
10:07 don't have to because
10:08 they get messages on linkedin and
10:10 they may be happy in their jobs and they
10:13 don't even think about applying
10:15 so this is where
10:16 sourcing is
10:18 often a big part when it comes to hiring
10:20 data professionals
10:23 um
10:24 yeah i'm not sure if i'm answering your
10:26 question do let me know
10:28 like the the question was what's
10:31 exactly you do there and i think it's
10:33 only a part of your only partly answered
10:36 because i think there is more right yes
10:38 so yeah so it's quite a long journey um
10:40 so let's say yeah we post a job with and
10:42 also at this simultaneously typically we
10:44 source for candidates so we start
10:46 reaching out to them on linkedin but
10:48 only any other ways that the sourcer can
10:50 find you you might have experienced this
10:53 yourself
10:54 uh sometimes even facebook twitter
10:56 reddit i mean there's so many github um
10:59 maybe not so much for data professionals
11:02 um more so for software engineers but
11:04 anyways we can find and and get in touch
11:07 with with people we think are right
11:09 um that's um that's what we would do so
11:12 we you know
11:13 in a lot of words
11:15 right
11:15 uh yeah yeah i personally haven't done
11:18 that to be honest um but i know some
11:20 sorcerers who who really like kind of
11:22 quite geeky and they they like to you
11:24 know come up with new ways um so i'm not
11:27 sure how they do this but if you want to
11:29 get hired go to reddit and post stuff
11:31 there
11:34 yeah i mean yeah many many different
11:36 ways also like looking at university
11:38 alumni so especially for data
11:40 professionals if we are looking for
11:42 people who need to have certain like
11:44 phds
11:45 um looking at you know the alumni of
11:47 universities um looking at conferences
11:50 so when i source for data science i
11:52 looked at that a lot
11:54 the machine learning conferences
11:56 and the papers that were submitted um
11:59 so yeah sourcing is a big part and it
12:01 takes a while it's it's a long term also
12:04 kind of strategy of trying to hire
12:08 data professionals um and this then also
12:11 comes along with partnering with the
12:12 hiring manager so at this point you know
12:14 depends on the sourcer like if you are
12:16 if there is someone who's just starting
12:17 as a sourcer or not yet fully
12:19 understands what they are looking for
12:21 because you know we recruiters are not
12:22 technical people we don't have computer
12:24 science degrees it takes also for us a
12:26 while to understand what what is the
12:28 right profile um so then we typically
12:32 partner with the hiring manager or
12:33 interviewers or people in the team or
12:36 other data scientists within the company
12:38 to understand you know are those the
12:40 right type of profiles those who apply
12:42 and the ones i reach out to um and then
12:44 hopefully we do have some candidates and
12:46 we you know put them through the process
12:47 so we start i would start with with the
12:49 recruiter interview um you know spend
12:52 some time discussing people's
12:54 motivations and and also practicalities
12:56 of you know
12:58 what they would be looking for um and
13:00 then um and then you know we go for the
13:03 stages so as a recruiter i would take
13:04 that candidate through all the stages so
13:06 starting from the recruiter interview
13:09 then technical screening then the
13:10 on-site interviews and you know as we go
13:12 providing feedback from those interviews
13:15 and then to up to the offer including
13:17 making them an offer so that's um that's
13:20 like kind of end-to-end recruitment or
13:21 like sometimes we call it 360 recruiters
13:24 there are because there are recruiters
13:25 who don't do the whole the whole part as
13:27 well but um but um more so i think more
13:30 often these days it's just you do
13:32 everything so you also then make the
13:34 offer to the candidate and i think
13:35 that's something would also me as a
13:37 recruiter i enjoyed right like being
13:39 able to to go through this journey with
13:41 someone and at the end you know make
13:44 them an offer and hopefully they accept
13:45 it which is even even even nicer
13:48 um so making an offer and then yeah
13:51 making sure that uh if they accept it
13:53 they also get their contracts um
13:56 okay that's kind of that's a lot of work
13:58 so you mentioned quite a few interesting
14:00 things that i wanted to ask so first i
14:02 wanted to ask about
14:04 apart from reddit so ready to think was
14:06 quite interesting but what
14:09 got my attention is you mentioned that
14:11 you
14:12 when a hiring manager comes to you
14:14 saying i want to hire a data scientist
14:16 or
14:17 applied scientist
14:18 you
14:20 first
14:20 kind of negotiate with them what is
14:22 realistically possible
14:24 so does it
14:26 often happen when they come with
14:28 a profile that doesn't exist and you
14:30 have to manage their expectations yes
14:33 yes
14:34 that's that's the part of the challenge
14:36 this is also why i actually particularly
14:38 as i said to you you know when you first
14:39 reach out to me that like i don't no
14:41 longer recruit for data science um but
14:44 it's all very close to my heart because
14:46 in the very beginning of my career like
14:48 as a sourcer at the land of for data
14:50 science
14:51 and the first six months i think i was
14:52 not able to make a higher and for
14:54 recruiter actually this is important
14:56 like to know when you are a candidate
14:58 because
14:59 you to understand that recruiters are
15:01 there to make hires which means that
15:03 actually they are in a way on your side
15:05 because they want you to sign that
15:06 contract so they will do everything
15:07 possible to make sure obviously within
15:10 you know um the ethics of the job but
15:13 they you know we will do anything
15:14 possible to to make sure you sign it and
15:16 you are happy in your job um so for me
15:18 it was like the first six months i think
15:20 um
15:21 i
15:22 you know i didn't make any hires i
15:24 wasn't able to find anyone and this was
15:26 kind of quite a quite a challenge um so
15:29 yeah a big part usually is the the
15:31 expectations that some hiring managers
15:33 have i think to say that over time and
15:36 later on down the line i was very lucky
15:38 to have very good hiring managers at
15:41 zalando who really understood the market
15:43 and like over time we were able to build
15:45 this relationships with
15:47 you know there was an understanding that
15:49 if some if you know the hiring manager
15:51 coming to me saying like i need free
15:52 principal data scientists
15:55 um
15:55 okay
15:57 that's what i would say
15:58 that's very funny
16:00 um but i was comfortable to say that of
16:02 course because i knew that they
16:04 understand that this is not going to
16:05 happen in the next month
16:07 and i would typically say that yeah it's
16:08 going to be minimum six to nine months
16:10 before we hire the first one um so yeah
16:14 um so this is uh very often the thing
16:16 and i think it's not just because uh you
16:19 know sometimes it's because
16:21 maybe hiring energies not necessarily
16:23 have the data science background
16:24 themselves it could be that they're
16:26 engineering managers so they have
16:27 software engineering background but they
16:29 need to hire data scientists for their
16:30 teams um
16:32 and then this is where i would need to
16:33 you know as a recruiter provide them
16:35 more advice and give them insights of
16:36 the market and what are the profits that
16:38 are available and uh what is realistic
16:41 and oftentimes they would understand
16:42 that and that would be fine and we would
16:44 agree on okay what are you know what are
16:45 the must-haves and what we can
16:47 compromise
16:49 so yeah and so you have this information
16:52 you can say okay finding this kind of
16:54 experience like i don't know
16:57 just uh experience with kubernetes maybe
17:00 it's very difficult to find
17:01 in data science profiles right and then
17:04 if the hiring manager really insists on
17:06 having this profile you will need to say
17:09 that okay you know that it
17:12 severely reduces the number of
17:13 candidates you would have for this
17:15 position
17:20 you have to i think like as a recruiter
17:22 especially in in
17:24 tech recruitment but
17:25 especially when dealing with data
17:27 scientists i've noticed like this is the
17:28 thing you just need to have the data to
17:30 show them and that's the easiest way to
17:32 convince someone it's not about you know
17:33 the feelings or like what i well my gut
17:36 feeling you know what it is uh but um
17:38 but yeah you know as a resourcer also
17:40 like in the recruiter you're able to
17:42 gather this this data linkedin also has
17:44 the tool like market insights so a lot
17:47 of recruiters have access to that some
17:49 some of us don't um so then you have to
17:50 be a bit more creative but but you you
17:53 can show them like at least roughly like
17:55 okay this is how the market looks like
17:57 so if you then you know the more
17:59 must-haves you add the the the more
18:02 tight or narrow the funnel is or the the
18:05 the available talent and that's that
18:08 helps to drive the conversation
18:10 interesting
18:12 and another thing you mentioned is then
18:14 you work with the hiring manager to make
18:16 sure that the position the job
18:18 description looks attractive
18:20 and uh how do you do this like by
18:23 carefully picking the words or
18:25 how exactly this that works yeah so i
18:28 think
18:30 i mean for me always it was the case
18:31 like i wouldn't write a job description
18:33 myself because um i don't know what
18:35 specifically specific ai tools or
18:38 methods in machine learning have to be
18:41 there and how to word it so it actually
18:42 makes sense to someone reading it um who
18:45 is a data scientist so i would always
18:47 first ask them to draft like a job
18:49 description we would have some format
18:51 that has to be followed but uh but yeah
18:53 um and then just checking that the
18:55 wording makes sense um but um
18:58 i think um
19:00 it's also about like understanding that
19:03 um not just like you know putting the
19:05 right buzzwords because that's
19:07 but being able to like really show i
19:10 think what the person will be doing and
19:12 i think what i found out when i was you
19:14 know going through and sourcing as well
19:16 as like
19:17 you know working with hiring managers is
19:18 that data scientists or data
19:20 professionals like to
19:22 they like to know what problems they
19:24 will be solving and it's about like they
19:26 get excited about the problems
19:29 you know um so being able to write a job
19:32 description that focuses on that this is
19:34 actually the problem we have right now
19:36 and you'll be part of that team who is
19:38 trying to solve it that's what gets
19:40 people's attention and excitement and
19:42 not just saying oh yeah we have those
19:44 perks and benefits like free lunches or
19:46 coffee like
19:47 yes it's great but you know it's not as
19:49 exciting um so
19:51 yeah in that sense but another interests
19:53 are good as well
19:55 i agree yeah
19:58 but yeah when it comes to making a
19:59 decision to switch jobs um you know like
20:02 yeah if not that's not enough right it
20:03 doesn't like flip the scales yeah um
20:06 another part of actually writing job
20:08 descriptions this is something that is
20:09 maybe more recent um
20:12 is that there are some tools which are
20:14 actually ai driven tools that allow us
20:17 to
20:18 to
20:18 to go for the job description so they
20:20 would go for the job description and
20:21 tell us like okay this is you know what
20:24 kind of audience this um job description
20:26 will attract and right now there is you
20:29 might be aware there is a big
20:30 conversation about having more inclusion
20:32 and diversity in tech
20:35 especially
20:36 and you know when it comes to gender
20:38 diversity for instance there are certain
20:40 tools that are able to tell us like okay
20:42 this job description that you've just
20:44 written is really speaking loud to uh to
20:47 men or people who identify as men more
20:50 so than a woman so if you're actually
20:52 trying to balance out your team a little
20:53 bit maybe you should change a few words
20:55 and and it gives you like an indication
20:57 of what kind of words you can swap um
21:00 and and yeah that's that's
21:02 actually something that was you know
21:04 that that is ai or machine learning
21:06 driven which is quite interesting and
21:08 can be helpful also
21:11 yeah thanks i think i
21:12 uh also used this tool it would say okay
21:15 this phrase uh
21:17 i don't remember the exact examples but
21:19 it would say this phrase
21:21 will appear more to male candidates if
21:23 you want to be more inclusive consider
21:25 changing it and then it gives a couple
21:27 of suggestions yeah it makes it more
21:29 neutral yeah exactly
21:32 yeah
21:34 and yeah so when it comes to sourcing so
21:37 you now posted it so you negotiated the
21:40 requirements with the hiring manager you
21:42 made an attractive job description
21:44 now you go live with this description
21:47 people start applying but he also
21:48 mentioned that it's not enough you also
21:50 need to actively reach out to people
21:52 and go to twitter
21:55 github or linkedin i guess obviously and
22:00 write people saying hey we have this
22:01 amazing job description how about having
22:03 a chat and so how in this case do you
22:06 select uh profiles what does speak your
22:08 attention here
22:10 um
22:13 so i think
22:15 well typically to be honest uh i mean
22:17 there's many tools you can go through
22:18 but i think linkedin is a good starting
22:20 starting point usually because um
22:23 you can at least get an idea of who's
22:25 available
22:26 and it has also quite interesting
22:29 filters so i can filter out for years of
22:31 experience for instance or
22:33 the level degree levels and and things
22:35 like that and then putting boolean
22:37 strings of keywords um so it's quite
22:39 good in that respect
22:40 so that would be like a starting point
22:42 um
22:43 and um yeah what i would do is um
22:47 i would look at profiles that matched
22:49 you know the initial keywords or the job
22:51 description that i have in front of me
22:53 or this based on the discussion that i
22:54 had with the hiring manager
22:56 the most um so i think you know first
23:00 like try to narrow it down um
23:03 yeah to like whatever is like the ideal
23:05 case scenario right um so i know what
23:07 are where those people who they are
23:10 and then you know verified it with the
23:12 hiring manager to see like okay these
23:13 are the initial results like i haven't
23:14 reached out to you to those people but
23:16 like what do you think does this is this
23:18 profit correct because again like if i'm
23:20 starting i might not really know
23:23 um
23:24 so
23:25 what stands out i think what i do look
23:27 at a lot on uh when doing when looking
23:30 at um
23:32 linkedin and sourcing is the experience
23:34 itself um but also education so like i
23:38 think this is kind of something that has
23:40 has to be balanced when looking for data
23:42 science
23:43 people or data professionals
23:46 um
23:46 [Music]
23:48 often the degree like phd or at least
23:50 masters is like a a must not always um
23:54 but that would be something i would look
23:56 at um as opposed to for instance if i
23:58 was looking for software engineers that
24:00 doesn't necessarily wouldn't be the case
24:02 but when it comes to data science yes
24:04 often it would be a requirement so i had
24:07 to look at what kind of degree it is uh
24:09 is it computer science is it physics is
24:11 it is it biology whatever it is and to
24:15 check if this this is okay and balance
24:17 it also with the amount of experience
24:19 and what that person did um
24:21 not just the years of experience but
24:23 what they write in their
24:24 responsibilities so like i think the
24:26 worst scenario for a sorcerer is like
24:28 having a linkedin profile of someone
24:30 which is like a skeleton profile where
24:32 there is just like a company they work
24:34 for and the title
24:36 but nothing in the description of the
24:38 tasks or responsibilities that they do
24:40 or sometimes people just put the
24:41 description of what the company does i'm
24:43 like i know what this company does i
24:45 already researched them like thank you
24:47 very much i wish to know what you are
24:48 actually doing there
24:50 of course i think some people do it on
24:51 purpose because maybe they don't want to
24:53 be contacted by recruiters i understand
24:55 that um
24:56 and then i have to judge if this is kind
24:58 of something i still want to do or not
25:00 but then that also means my message to
25:01 that person is not going to be very
25:03 personal because i really don't know so
25:05 it's more like a stab in the dark um but
25:08 yeah um looking at the exact
25:10 responsibilities what this person did
25:12 themselves um
25:14 not just like the team what the team was
25:16 focusing on but themselves that they
25:18 built those machine learning algorithms
25:20 and models from scratch
25:21 um or or not and
25:24 you know and then combining that with
25:26 looking at the degree um
25:29 and uh
25:31 yeah
25:32 and obviously the keywords yes as a
25:34 recruiter you know that's what i can
25:35 rely on like really those things i don't
25:38 my data points are i can't i i can't
25:41 read a paper that someone wrote for the
25:43 phd and understand it often i don't
25:46 sometimes maybe like the summary in the
25:48 beginning but you know like very vaguely
25:50 so um so yeah there's very few things
25:53 and
25:54 not always getting it right
25:56 do you remember what kind of keywords
25:58 you were putting there
25:59 uh like let's say if you
26:02 were to look for a data scientist right
26:04 now what kind of keywords you would put
26:06 in the search tool yeah machine learning
26:08 or ai or data sci well not data science
26:12 i would say machine learning or ai or ml
26:15 and then
26:16 or at some actually no
26:18 yes and i could continue with my stream
26:20 in terms of rs like deep learning or as
26:24 a few other like known um maybe or a bit
26:28 more popular
26:29 um
26:31 algorithms but that also depends on the
26:33 job description because if we're looking
26:34 for a computer vision specialist for
26:36 instance with deep learning skills then
26:38 yes those i would put but maybe i
26:39 wouldn't put
26:41 uh
26:42 you know some other uh uh
26:44 mathematical models and things in there
26:47 so but i would take this from the job
26:48 description right exactly yeah that
26:51 would be my starting point um like the
26:53 mast has what are the like the the three
26:55 or you know four like must haves and i
26:57 would just put it in the string so
26:59 sometimes it would give a very broad um
27:02 pull but then i would narrow it down
27:04 with with the degrees and you know the
27:06 level of experience
27:08 yeah
27:09 how important do you think is having a
27:11 master's degree so let's say somebody
27:14 has only a bachelor uh degree uh a level
27:17 of litigation or maybe they don't have
27:19 any degree at all
27:21 how important it is
27:23 i'm not really sure if there's that much
27:25 difference between bachelors and masters
27:26 i feel like there was always been more
27:28 distinction if there was a requirement
27:30 coming
27:31 from the hiring managers about like do
27:33 they need to have a phd or not
27:35 and if it was not
27:37 then
27:38 it wasn't specifically oh that means
27:40 they have to have masters it was more
27:41 like it could be bachelors or masters
27:43 but i think this distinction between
27:45 from like masters between masters and
27:46 phd sometimes that is important so
27:49 sometimes it was really a must but then
27:51 it was for instance for a team that was
27:53 very research heavy team where maybe
27:55 they weren't working on specific product
27:57 that there was a research lab for
27:59 instance and within zalando but they
28:02 didn't work on a specific
28:04 product and delivering that um
28:07 but they needed to have a phd and and
28:09 papers that was the point of the team uh
28:12 let's say uh in a very high level from
28:14 regular perspective and i don't want to
28:16 like undermine that but yeah uh but then
28:19 for other teams that maybe you know they
28:21 they didn't really need that like this
28:23 we don't need people we have phds or
28:25 even masters we do want them to of
28:26 course have solid education in terms of
28:28 like they understand the maps behind
28:30 some of the tools they are using and
28:31 algorithms but
28:33 but they don't have to
28:35 have masters that was often also
28:38 a thing or something we discussed yeah
28:40 okay and yeah also i prepared a couple
28:43 of questions about cv screening and i
28:45 think we covered that partly
28:48 because i assume the process for you
28:50 of looking at linkedin profile is
28:52 similar to looking at a cv that you get
28:55 when somebody applies
28:56 is it similar you mentioned for a
28:58 linkedin profile you look for
29:00 exact responsibilities what exactly the
29:02 person did
29:03 right i think this is still important
29:05 for a cv right what else is important
29:07 for a cv what uh yeah i mean how do you
29:10 look at the suv of an applicant to
29:12 decide if you want to continue talking
29:14 with this candidate or you want to
29:16 not continue
29:18 yeah i think cv is slightly only
29:20 different in this sense that in in
29:22 linkedin there is a certain format
29:24 so typically you would see the
29:26 experience uh and the role
29:27 responsibilities first um after of
29:30 course the name and the picture and in
29:32 the cv sometimes i noticed like
29:34 people would put maybe their education
29:36 first so like
29:37 like for me i think the experience
29:40 working for like an in-house recruiter
29:42 for a company that needed typically
29:43 mostly senior people meaning senior not
29:46 in terms of age of course but uh level
29:48 like they experienced let's put it that
29:50 way maybe that's a better word um then
29:53 that's what that would be the first
29:54 thing i would look at and then secondly
29:56 at the education so my advice actually
29:58 here is like of course it depends if you
30:00 are like a recent graduate who doesn't
30:02 have much experience
30:04 maybe it is better to put the education
30:06 to highlight that as a first point
30:09 uh but i think experience typically
30:11 beats
30:12 most of that even if it's just six
30:13 months internship uh i would already
30:16 like put that on top of the cv because
30:18 that that's what you know i would look
30:20 at um but yeah it's very similar so it's
30:22 like looking at the experience and the
30:24 education um and the one put and again
30:27 with the cvs i would often also see that
30:29 there will be title and there will be a
30:31 list of responsibilities that will be
30:32 very vague or sometimes people put like
30:34 a list of
30:35 tools
30:37 but it's just like a list of tools and
30:39 i'm not really sure like what did they
30:40 do with them like how often did they
30:42 work with them i have no clue like so um
30:45 so and sometimes i see also on cvs and
30:48 maybe not so much on linkedin but that
30:49 could also be the case that people do
30:51 put a lot of those buzzwords
30:54 and that can be very confusing it used
30:56 to be very confusing for me because then
30:57 i was like okay well this person
30:59 mentions all of the things that i have
31:01 in a job description so it looks fine
31:03 but then i
31:04 would turn out actually they wouldn't be
31:06 able to pass the first interview and i
31:08 it was like okay like did i do something
31:11 wrong maybe i should have explained but
31:13 um but i was also lucky enough to have a
31:15 lot of really um like i built some
31:18 network within
31:20 the land of data scientists who are very
31:22 very helpful i remember specifically
31:24 mikio brown who i think was on your
31:26 podcast uh some time ago he would sit
31:28 with me in my very first few years like
31:31 first year i think as a sorcerer every
31:34 week i think for an hour maybe even just
31:37 screening the cds because like i had no
31:39 clue what i was doing i was like look
31:40 like it's soon gonna be six months i'm
31:42 not sure if i'm gonna pass my probation
31:44 here because i haven't made any higher
31:46 so like
31:47 um so that was very helpful as well for
31:50 me to see like how he looks at the cvs
31:52 from the perspective of someone who
31:53 actually does the job um and that was
31:56 very helpful because then i i learned to
31:58 read between the lines or learn to
32:02 read beyond just someone putting the
32:04 buzzwords because sometimes people would
32:05 put the passwords but there would be
32:08 nothing else
32:09 or they could be the opposite they
32:11 wouldn't actually really showcase and
32:12 highlight what they did and you know
32:15 then you could miss out because
32:17 maybe you will get rejected just because
32:18 you didn't put something in your in your
32:20 city so yeah
32:23 so what can people do to
32:25 make their cvs more attractive so first
32:28 thing you said
32:29 you should move education
32:31 down and put prioritize work experience
32:34 what else can candidates do to be more
32:36 more successful at this stage
32:39 be very clear about the responsibilities
32:41 and what you did in your current job on
32:43 your previous jobs as opposed to what
32:45 the team did of course i i don't mean
32:47 like if there was a
32:48 no don't
32:50 don't give credit to the team and don't
32:51 like you know own up to things that you
32:54 didn't do on your own but i think do
32:56 highlight like what was your part in
32:58 that team effort because that's
33:00 at the end of the day that's also like
33:02 yeah what's you know what we need to
33:04 know um and that really helps a lot um
33:07 and it helps a lot also with driving
33:09 further interviews and uh for the
33:11 interviewers further down the line
33:13 because then they can ask you more
33:15 informed questions and avoid asking you
33:16 questions that are totally irrelevant
33:18 which you probably like be also confused
33:20 about um so yeah be very specific about
33:23 your tasks and the responsibilities what
33:25 you accomplished like the things you did
33:28 um
33:29 and if that was part of the team effort
33:30 of course i also mentioned that but
33:32 this is important more so than than the
33:34 title i think because that was so
33:36 confusing and this was also part of big
33:38 part of confusion when i started as a
33:40 data science sourcer like six years ago
33:44 the title was like could mean anything
33:46 data scientist was like it could be
33:48 anyone anyone but yeah
33:51 not many things changed since then
33:54 i was hoping i i i thought it was
33:56 getting got a little bit better a little
33:58 bit but still like uh it's not always
34:01 you really have to look into the
34:03 responsibilities to understand ah okay
34:04 this is the kind of data scientist you
34:06 mean
34:07 yeah so responsibilities just to answer
34:09 your question shortly because i don't
34:11 want to like of course go over time but
34:12 um yeah responsibilities being very
34:14 clear also like the month and the year
34:16 not just year after year because that
34:18 could be a year 1 12 months difference
34:20 sometimes um but uh
34:23 and you know practical things like
34:25 making sure there is no typos but i
34:27 think that's kind of quite obvious um
34:30 and
34:30 if i could
34:32 offer my opinion which is like opinion
34:34 not necessarily or my preference and i
34:36 but i do have a lot of recruiting
34:38 colleagues who also do mention that
34:40 there is this europass format of cvs
34:44 it's horrible
34:46 very
34:47 very difficult to read i have no idea
34:49 where is what uh and i think it's like
34:51 an eu somehow i'm not sure but um
34:55 but yeah it's uh it's something i would
34:57 avoid and oh one thing i do want to also
34:59 mention to avoid because i know in
35:01 germany in particular it's a kind of
35:03 more of a
35:04 i guess tradition that you put
35:07 your photo on the cv uh in some
35:09 countries not just germany i've seen
35:11 this that you add your photo and i know
35:14 that in some more traditional companies
35:16 this is required so you actually have to
35:18 add your photo but um but what i see
35:21 like the trends i see now and like what
35:23 i think is more beneficial to people
35:26 applying uh is to not attach the photo
35:29 and don't put your date of birth
35:32 things like that this is because we are
35:33 all biased and it's unconscious bias so
35:36 i'm not like you know intentionally but
35:38 like when you see a photo first you you
35:40 might have in in you know immediately
35:42 you have you start forming assumptions
35:44 in your brain without knowing it and
35:46 that also helps you then as a candidate
35:48 to to reduce that bias um and hopefully
35:51 you know be more successful so i would
35:53 say
35:55 of course you have to judge for yourself
35:57 as i said for some companies they will
35:58 require that and that's fine but i think
36:00 for a lot of maybe smaller companies
36:02 startups or like tech companies
36:05 i would avoid adding your your photo
36:08 yeah thanks
36:10 and so now you look at the cv you decide
36:14 to move forward with a candidate and the
36:16 next step is an interview with recruiter
36:19 with you right um
36:21 so how does it look like what do you
36:23 talk about there
36:25 yeah um
36:27 i mean my interviews i think were quite
36:30 short
36:31 so i i but the every recruiter does it
36:33 differently but typically you know
36:35 recruiters are not going to ask
36:36 technical questions um we can't i we did
36:40 try at some point in the very beginning
36:41 it's a lander to come up with very like
36:43 short and um
36:45 um screening questions uh on like very
36:48 like basics of machine learning that i
36:50 could ask and verify the answer like
36:52 kind of abc answer
36:54 and everyone was passing them so so i
36:57 decided like this doesn't make any sense
36:59 um so my focus would be on the soft
37:01 skills so-called soft skills uh so more
37:04 about you know
37:06 what the person has been doing sometimes
37:08 there are some things in the civil life
37:09 gaps in the city that i would like to
37:10 clarify or if the city isn't super like
37:13 um it's a bit more generic then i would
37:15 ask like what were actually your
37:16 responsibilities and accomplishments in
37:18 your current or previous jobs um
37:20 um you know if the phd is important like
37:23 what was it about and uh i would
37:25 sometimes ask like can you explain it to
37:27 me uh someone who is not technical
37:29 because for data scientists i think uh
37:32 maybe not so much for for less
37:34 experience but from the more kind of
37:35 seniors sometimes it's um that's also
37:38 part
37:39 it's not just about the technical
37:40 ability and skills it's also about being
37:42 able to explain those complex concepts
37:45 to people who have no idea about machine
37:48 learning to be able to convince them
37:50 sometimes that you know this is not
37:51 realistic solution that you have in mind
37:53 and we can't do that um so i would like
37:56 to test it on myself so like can you
37:58 explain to me what you did in your phd
37:59 in words that you know i can understand
38:02 and that i really liked because um um i
38:05 also learned quite a lot and i learned
38:07 actually to really like like data
38:09 science and you know talking to to
38:11 people who do that because it's really
38:12 fascinating but but yeah i would ask
38:15 questions uh typically like behavior
38:17 questions as well so if you can give me
38:19 an example of a situation when you
38:21 had to work with a difficult stakeholder
38:24 um why was it difficult
38:26 and this i think could be difficult um
38:30 because i would see like a lot of people
38:32 answer in a very general or hypothetical
38:34 scenarios um so
38:36 so it's more about okay try to answer
38:38 you know like give me an actual example
38:40 from the past and walk me through like
38:42 your you know actions and
38:44 and what did you do in that situation
38:47 specifically and what was the outcome um
38:49 so yeah these these are called like
38:52 behavioral questions because we ask we
38:53 want to check for the behaviors we want
38:55 to see if the person will fit with the
38:57 culture of the company
38:58 uh and the values that the company has
39:01 um so that's why we asked them
39:03 uh
39:04 yeah and then the practical questions at
39:06 the end i typically ask about your
39:08 notice period if you are currently
39:09 employed so like how sunny could start
39:11 if you you know decided to join us um
39:14 and then obviously salary so what are
39:16 your expectations um
39:18 and also
39:20 yeah how uh how actively you are
39:22 interviewing with your current uh
39:24 you know currently because even if i you
39:26 know that would be the thing like i
39:27 might be sourcing people who are passive
39:30 but then
39:31 so are 15 other recruiters and sources
39:34 from other companies and you end up you
39:36 know sometimes i speak to them in the
39:38 very beginning of the process but at the
39:39 end they already have other offers on
39:41 the table so
39:42 i wanted to verify it in the very
39:43 beginning like how advanced you are in
39:45 those stages because there is still a
39:46 process to happen
39:48 so how much time we have left so those
39:50 were like practical questions
39:52 and when it comes to salary uh solid
39:55 expectation questions
39:56 um i heard this uh advice
40:00 the advice is never tell the number
40:02 first so when somebody asks you like
40:05 let's say i'm a data scientist you're a
40:06 recruiter we are having this initial
40:09 screening and you
40:12 ask me what are your salary expectations
40:14 and if i follow this advice then i would
40:16 say
40:17 no i will not tell you tell me what what
40:19 is the salary range and then the
40:21 recruiter would say but we want to base
40:23 uh
40:24 you know and then
40:25 you know
40:26 this ping pong so what do you think
40:28 about this advice like is it uh good
40:30 advice should people follow this
40:33 uh it depends
40:34 um but what i would do before answering
40:37 so like first i would actually say
40:40 um
40:41 it can be super helpful to know the
40:43 expectations so i would still ask this
40:45 but um but i would say don't necessarily
40:48 say what your current salary is and this
40:50 is something i follow myself so when i
40:52 was interviewing recently for a new job
40:54 i made it the point of you know
40:56 not answering that question and it's
40:58 absolutely fine not to say what your
41:00 current salary is it's no one's business
41:02 also like your future employer i think
41:04 in most of european countries at least
41:07 won't be able to check and if you say
41:09 some number and it's not true like they
41:11 won't be able to check that and they
41:12 shouldn't it's personal data so
41:14 ignore that question or just like say
41:16 look i'm just something that i'm willing
41:18 to share and i i you know because
41:20 sometimes recruiters are told that this
41:22 is the question you have to ask um and
41:24 they will ask you this but um but just
41:26 no you don't have to answer that when it
41:28 comes to expectations though that's a
41:30 bit more tricky because we want to know
41:32 if this is like if your expectations are
41:34 totally off and i mean by that like 20
41:36 000 off in terms of like the annual
41:39 number then probably we shouldn't be
41:41 wasting your time right and and the
41:43 recruiter or the company's time
41:45 um and this is tricky and it depends
41:47 because it depends on the company so
41:49 there are i know that there are some
41:50 companies and i speak to candidates
41:51 every day there are some companies that
41:54 um
41:55 how their
41:56 the structure internally is based is
41:58 that if you interview them it depends on
42:00 how good you are negotiating
42:02 so if you're not good at negotiating you
42:04 will get whatever you ask for in the
42:06 beginning and that's it and someone told
42:07 me like yeah they gave me the salary and
42:09 i learned later that my colleague in the
42:11 same level earns this amount more
42:14 and when i told this to to them they
42:16 were like well yeah you should have
42:17 negotiated better and um some companies
42:20 will still still do that i think
42:21 typically maybe smaller companies um
42:24 so that's why it's good to actually ask
42:27 how does your
42:29 salary structure works how does the
42:31 leveling and structure work in this
42:33 company before i answer this question
42:35 because um if it is the type of company
42:37 where they just like it all depends on
42:39 how well you
42:40 interview and you know
42:42 what you ask for then then yeah don't
42:44 tell them your expectations um you know
42:47 like i'll be honest don't uh but you
42:49 know in a lot of companies like the
42:50 bigger ones um there is a leveling there
42:53 is leveling and that means that also to
42:55 uh to that level to every level whether
42:57 it's junior mid level senior and and
42:59 above there is attached a band
43:02 and that means that often like i say
43:04 this actually to candidates right away
43:05 it's like no matter what you're gonna
43:07 say even if the number is very low i
43:09 will tell you what our band is but just
43:12 so you know just because you asked for
43:14 lower amount
43:15 we're not going to give you that amount
43:17 we will still put you on that range if
43:19 we feel like you are truly a senior or a
43:21 mid level um
43:22 because yeah it will be very unfair it
43:24 and i think a lot of companies try to
43:26 avoid that because it is unfair
43:28 um because it leads to
43:30 yeah like a lot of weird
43:33 you know atmosphere between two members
43:34 not a good thing that later on than the
43:36 line in long term so yeah if it's a
43:39 company that has established
43:40 ranges and also leveling and then then i
43:44 think it's okay for you to share and you
43:46 don't have to actually say
43:48 specific number you can give them a
43:50 range and that's already sometimes good
43:51 enough
43:52 and also what you can say is that this
43:55 is my initial estimate what i want but
43:57 this may change because i'm interviewing
43:59 with two other companies or this company
44:01 and uh i will also do my research this
44:03 is sometimes what people also tell me
44:05 they say like okay well i thought about
44:06 this number but actually you know two
44:08 weeks later they maybe got an offer
44:10 that's higher than this and now it's
44:11 changed and that's also fine like this
44:14 is life right so as a recruiter we learn
44:16 like we expect that we expect that you
44:18 know this is not set in stone i'm not
44:20 gonna hold you to this at the end and
44:22 like a month later turn on and say like
44:24 oh but you said this and this is wrong
44:26 well i i mean in the data science um
44:29 recruitment market
44:31 it would be weird for me to expect that
44:33 you know people will not have other
44:35 offers i mean of course it depends
44:37 sometimes if you're
44:38 just a graduate you probably it's harder
44:41 to find a job but uh
44:43 but people change their minds and like
44:45 you know expectations change and that's
44:46 fine as long as you're open about it
44:48 from the beginning so say that in the
44:50 beginning that this may change
44:52 and and keep the recruiter posted this
44:54 is that's all we want like you know
44:57 just so you let us know um so we can
45:00 counteract and try to you know still
45:01 maybe you know do something about it
45:04 well yeah and yeah you mentioned if i uh
45:07 let's say
45:08 well i'm having this conversation with
45:10 the recruiter and then i give a number
45:12 that is quite high and then we see okay
45:14 there is no way we can match this
45:17 ask with what we have
45:20 but maybe the reason i
45:22 told this
45:23 high number is because i have no idea
45:25 how much to ask and then i just you know
45:28 pick a random big number and then say it
45:31 so what are the dangers here so the
45:32 danger is one the company might decide
45:35 not to continue right
45:37 yeah so well if someone did that like so
45:39 if they gave me a number it was very
45:40 high i would ask them okay like um can i
45:42 ask you like what did you base it on
45:44 because sometimes people uh as you said
45:46 they have no clue they just like just
45:47 throw a number but sometimes people like
45:49 look go on glassdoor so plaster also
45:52 allows you to like see like a salaries
45:53 of people from the same company you are
45:55 interviewing it there are like few other
45:57 tools some some candidates recently sent
45:59 me where you can check salaries like you
46:01 know globally for many different
46:03 companies and from there you can already
46:05 gather some sort of a range you know but
46:07 um but yeah sometimes people base it on
46:10 essentially the fact that they see
46:12 salaries being posted
46:14 on glassdoor or other sources and that's
46:16 a bit more informed but yeah if it's
46:18 like just stub in the dark and it's very
46:20 high i would ask them like oh is it
46:22 based on you know
46:24 other offers that you already received
46:25 before or is it based on just yeah
46:28 anything
46:29 um
46:30 i would still try to somehow
46:32 figure out if we can move forward
46:34 because you know as i said as a
46:35 recruiter i really want to hire people
46:37 um
46:39 but you know if someone says like no no
46:40 no this is like a must and i'm not
46:42 that's it like um then
46:45 then yeah that injury is that we would
46:47 just have to say okay then i guess it
46:48 doesn't make sense to
46:50 move forward with the process um
46:53 but um
46:54 i have to say yeah if if it's a very
46:57 very big gap um
46:59 but i don't even come across to be
47:01 honest these days very often with people
47:03 having a very like
47:05 wide expectations uh like very diff very
47:08 very like big gap
47:10 usually sometimes it could be like you
47:12 know maybe a couple of thousand in a
47:14 kind of annual amount and then
47:16 sometimes it could be outside of the
47:18 range for that level but that
47:20 could mean that okay maybe we can you
47:23 know discuss with the hiring manager and
47:25 find another way to compensate for that
47:27 you know there are those ways and i
47:29 think every recruiter would try if it's
47:31 possible but
47:32 if they tell you it's not then it's
47:34 probably true
47:35 okay thank you i
47:37 see that we have quite a few questions i
47:39 think it's time we try to cover them so
47:42 the first question uh from amen is how
47:45 can career
47:46 career changers get in the eye of a
47:49 recruiter
47:50 so what would be your advice to people
47:53 who are changing their careers let's say
47:54 they want to get to zalando or some
47:57 other company or
47:58 you're hiring for so what advice would
48:01 you give to them
48:03 yeah i think this is quite tough also
48:05 because i know that a lot of companies
48:06 um want people to have like specific
48:09 degree even if it's bachelors but from a
48:11 university and like in computer science
48:13 and then if you come from a different
48:15 background and you're changing careers
48:16 from something very not not even tech
48:19 related it's it's really um
48:21 challenging and i i did see a lot of
48:23 people actually also do that so like
48:26 do some of the courses of coursera and
48:28 you know then try to swap but i think it
48:30 is very difficult because there is
48:33 experience is what matters the most
48:35 um and unfortunately yeah that's
48:37 difficult i would say try to gather
48:39 experience even if it's like as i said
48:41 an internship apprenticeship unpaid and
48:44 this is
48:45 again like this is something that is i
48:47 hope will change but
48:49 you know for many people it's not easy
48:51 to just you know do an internship that
48:53 is unpaid for six months because you
48:55 have bills to pay
48:57 so so that's that's a that's a
48:59 difficulty that i totally understand but
49:00 i i that's you know
49:02 if i can give advice another advice i
49:04 would give though is um
49:07 try to network as much as possible with
49:09 people
49:10 who are data scientists in those
49:12 companies um
49:14 and yeah uh whether it's meetups you
49:18 know or any kind of communities you can
49:19 find but also do connect with recruiters
49:23 on linkedin because um
49:25 there's a lot of recruiters who are
49:26 in-house recruiters and you know maybe
49:28 they work for those companies but the
49:29 companies are not really willing to to
49:31 look at people who career changes but
49:33 then there are also headhunters from
49:34 recruitment agencies who maybe you know
49:37 they typically have work with many
49:39 different clients actually so they will
49:40 work with many different companies and
49:42 then they kind of have a wider net and
49:44 they know
49:46 maybe there are some opportunities
49:47 somewhere so the more recurs you also
49:49 connect with the better
49:51 and then of course making sure your
49:53 linkedin profile is kind of um
49:56 as clear as possible and you list
49:58 everything and any kind of practical
50:00 experience you had
50:02 is there uh and um
50:04 and you know explained kind of clearly
50:07 what you did um during that but yeah
50:10 it's a tough thing because i think
50:12 there's a lot of
50:13 especially when it comes to data science
50:15 hiring i've seen a lot of the hiring
50:17 managers saying that we need people with
50:20 five years of experience at least and it
50:22 has to be from like a similar company
50:24 working on a product in a product team
50:26 you know
50:27 it's not something like yeah sometimes
50:30 not realistic yeah
50:32 yeah thanks
50:34 um what do you think about importance of
50:37 cover letter so there's a question from
50:39 alma is how important do you think in
50:42 your opinion to have a cover letter in
50:45 berlin or it's it should be more like
50:48 based on cve and cv is more important
50:50 than a cover letter
50:52 i think if the cv if the cover letter is
50:55 like obligatory during this application
50:57 process and sometimes it will be then of
50:59 course it's important and that means
51:01 that a recruiter or hiring managers are
51:03 both read it
51:04 i would say a lot of the times i
51:06 wouldn't read them
51:09 because i just didn't have time and i
51:11 think a lot of recruiters are in this
51:13 position to be honest uh but some of my
51:15 hiring managers did um so sometimes you
51:17 know like they would mention oh this
51:18 person mentioned that in the cover
51:20 letter and be like oh okay um
51:23 but um i would say it's not i i don't
51:26 find it very important unless um
51:30 again it's an entry level position so if
51:32 you are a graduate and there is a junior
51:34 level of data scientist position then
51:36 typically coverages would be something
51:38 that the recruitment team would look at
51:40 because there you probably don't have
51:42 that much experience to put in your cv
51:44 so they want to understand your
51:45 motivations a bit more
51:47 but if it's a more like seasoned or more
51:50 senior experienced level positions then
51:52 unless it's necessary like it says like
51:54 there's a star and that this is like
51:56 mandatory uh i wouldn't i wouldn't put
51:58 it
52:00 um
52:01 yeah i must confess as a hiring manager
52:03 i i often
52:06 take part as an interviewer or as a
52:08 hiring manager in interviews i also
52:10 don't look at cover letters to be honest
52:13 so
52:14 because i assume maybe a recruiter took
52:17 a look and sometimes i also try to avoid
52:19 looking at cv
52:20 not too biased myself so before the
52:22 interview i just you know talked to a
52:25 candidate and then after the interview i
52:26 look at the cv because i assume that
52:29 already the cv screening happened by the
52:31 recruiter or by somebody and then i try
52:34 not to look at the cv as well but yeah
52:35 yeah that's a good one yeah
52:38 yeah because as i said earlier right
52:40 about the photo for instance but there's
52:41 so many other things you you people put
52:43 on the cvs and like it can really
52:45 sometimes bias you without you even
52:47 knowing so
52:49 um and yeah if you kind of you know
52:51 already this person maybe was screened
52:53 by a recruiter and you trust them you
52:54 know that this is probably the right
52:56 candidate to talk to them then yeah i
52:58 also i think it's a good it's an
53:00 interesting idea yeah
53:02 yeah but probably for recruiter it's not
53:04 uh the best way of dealing with
53:07 cv screening
53:08 right now well that's i mean i mean if
53:11 we need your help so like if he was like
53:13 i would be on the fence about some
53:14 profiles still you know uh and then i
53:16 would ask the higher measure so then
53:17 yeah i would ask i would ask you
53:19 probably like yeah can you please look
53:20 at the cv but i think if it's like you
53:23 know if i'm kind of quite confident and
53:24 calibrated as a recruiter already and
53:26 you know i kind of know okay this
53:28 candidate looks like
53:30 good then then i think it would be fine
53:32 that you don't look and i think it's
53:33 against a way to try to
53:36 reduce bias a little bit which i think
53:38 is good
53:40 did he also um need to hire data analyst
53:43 profiles
53:45 i haven't myself but uh this was like at
53:47 zalando at least at the time when i was
53:49 there um it was a separate uh job family
53:52 but i i do see that this is also quite
53:55 becoming quite challenging and so and i
53:58 and i hear a lot of my colleagues and
54:00 recruiters uh i work with you know
54:02 who mentioned that it's sometimes uh
54:04 really a struggle to find them as well
54:06 so
54:08 yeah there's a question
54:09 from i mean uh is um like can you have
54:12 do you have any tips for
54:14 those who are looking for data analyst
54:16 jobs
54:18 um
54:20 no i don't think so i mean um because
54:22 again
54:23 uh it's like kind of like with data
54:25 science title we discuss sometimes data
54:27 analysis can be also a little bit
54:28 confusing from one company to another
54:30 because
54:31 it could be even that there is no data
54:33 scientist title but actually data
54:35 analysts
54:36 do what data scientists would do in
54:37 other companies
54:39 so i think it would really like depend
54:41 on the job description that you see
54:43 um but um
54:46 yeah i think i probably don't have that
54:47 much uh information about that i'm
54:50 afraid yeah the recruiting wise probably
54:52 it's very similar except the screening
54:54 phase maybe you would look for different
54:56 kind of keywords different kind of uh
54:59 maybe responsibilities but uh the rest
55:01 of the process
55:03 i assume would follow is similar
55:05 at least from the point of view of a
55:06 recruiter would
55:08 follow similar steps right exactly yeah
55:12 and uh what about somebody having two
55:14 bachelor degrees so for example one in
55:16 at and one in account management do you
55:19 think it's a
55:20 good thing would it stand out
55:22 would it make candidates stand out or
55:24 not
55:26 um i think would be interesting but i'm
55:28 not sure it will be something that will
55:30 kind of weigh the scales like i think
55:32 it's important that there is a technical
55:34 like that kind of technical degree
55:36 whether it's computer science or
55:38 related or related to machine learning
55:40 is probably something i would look out
55:43 for more
55:44 um but yeah if if there is also at the
55:47 same time another bachelor's degree in
55:49 um non-technical field uh that's that's
55:52 that's usually something interesting
55:53 like i would look at it but it wouldn't
55:55 kind of weigh the scales in one way or
55:57 the other i think
56:00 it will okay interesting but not more
56:02 than that right yeah i mean sometimes it
56:04 could be a good thing especially like uh
56:07 depends again on the role uh to be
56:09 honest um because it could you know
56:12 but then it just really is a bunch of
56:14 assumptions right like so if someone
56:15 says account management experience and
56:16 they think oh like maybe they're good at
56:18 you know presenting and you know uh
56:22 soft skills like
56:23 managing stakeholders um but then that's
56:26 just an assumption
56:27 so then
56:29 i'm not sure i think i haven't been
56:30 particularly paying attention to that i
56:32 have to be honest
56:34 okay there is a question from radu what
56:36 is the most difficult part of hiring a
56:39 data professional
56:44 um i think it's the how um how
56:48 for me it was from the in the very
56:50 beginning it was um
56:52 the ambiguity about the titles it seemed
56:55 like and i heard it from everyone so the
56:58 biggest difficulty was like there was
57:00 this suddenly the data science title
57:03 just exploded it just became like a
57:05 thing and everyone was putting that
57:06 under the cvs at least it seemed to me
57:08 to me on their profiles everyone wanted
57:11 to do ai or wanted to do deep learning
57:13 and like they would just put it
57:15 everywhere and then the companies would
57:17 also want to say that they are ai driven
57:19 and they use data
57:21 like deep learning and you know machine
57:23 learning so they would hire data
57:24 scientists and people or hire people
57:27 give them data scientist title
57:29 and then i would hear from people i
57:30 would interview like i was given this
57:32 title but i actually am a business
57:34 analyst really like i i have nothing to
57:36 do with my degree which was even deep
57:38 learning and that's why they want to
57:39 move so there was a lot of confusion and
57:41 then i had my difficulty was like how do
57:44 i know if someone is really worked as a
57:46 data scientist in terms of like what the
57:48 current company i work for thinks about
57:50 that
57:52 and then also having to explain to them
57:55 like especially source candidates like
57:58 so you you know like
57:59 like i remember we would go to like
58:01 neural information processing conference
58:03 with zalando and a lot of people would
58:04 come to our booth and was me and my
58:06 colleague from employer branding
58:07 non-data scientist people it's like why
58:10 are you here like what does zalando do
58:12 like with ai and then you know people
58:15 will be very suspicious and also
58:16 candidates because they had those bad
58:18 experiences with companies telling them
58:19 yes you will be doing deep learning and
58:21 then they didn't um so i had to really
58:24 become very good at explaining like yes
58:26 this is what we use it and these are the
58:28 problems you will actually be solving
58:29 and and you know so this this whole
58:32 ambiguity between the disconnect between
58:34 like
58:36 the title and what it really means
58:39 that was the biggest hurdle and the
58:40 second one was um that there is a lot of
58:43 competition so like when people
58:45 do what you know
58:46 the right type of people that we wanted
58:48 to hire would have many many offers
58:51 weekly they would get bombarded with
58:53 messages um
58:55 and it was about how to convince them to
58:58 join that particular company and um and
59:01 and it was so competitive typically it
59:03 will always have like you know two or
59:04 three other offers on the table
59:06 uh
59:07 with you know all different perks so
59:09 it's it's it's um that's a
59:11 that's the second one i think
59:14 it's quite scarce talent i i would
59:18 do you have time for a couple of more
59:20 questions yep
59:22 yeah i should have started with
59:23 questions more i realized that there is
59:25 a pile of them so apologies for not
59:27 no worries thank you to answer
59:29 yeah so
59:30 two recruiters consider portfolio
59:32 projects from courses like uh i know
59:35 courses from coursera do they do like
59:37 when you look at cvs and you look at
59:40 projects
59:41 do you think okay this person got a
59:43 project from a coursera course do you
59:45 think it's a good thing or not
59:47 depends on the hiring manager
59:49 um i think for some of them
59:52 it would be like it's nice but again
59:55 like with that the double bachelors
59:59 it would still be about the experience
1:00:01 that they did specifically with the
1:00:03 specific methods or tools and how they
1:00:05 implemented them and
1:00:07 um and um
1:00:09 and and then the experience itself so i
1:00:11 i have seen a lot of people especially
1:00:13 doing the coursera course of andrew ng i
1:00:16 think i've seen it alone i see it and a
1:00:18 lot of these cvs um and um
1:00:22 it wouldn't
1:00:24 i think maybe if it adds value for the
1:00:26 person and it helps them even if it is
1:00:28 to actually you know do the technical
1:00:30 interviews sometimes and refresh your
1:00:32 knowledge also then that's great but it
1:00:34 was not something that
1:00:36 would again um
1:00:38 it's more like a nice to have
1:00:40 okay so uh
1:00:42 that will be certainly helpful for the
1:00:45 person to pass the interview because
1:00:47 it might be very likely that uh at least
1:00:49 i remember uh the questions i got during
1:00:52 the interview with the london
1:00:54 some of these questions were covered in
1:00:56 that course so i also took that course
1:00:58 and that course was quite useful
1:00:59 requesting the interview
1:01:01 but as i think on your cv maybe it's not
1:01:03 the most important thing recruiters care
1:01:05 about right yeah no unless it's really
1:01:08 specifically said like oh actually
1:01:09 someone has it um it's just never
1:01:11 happened to me so i don't want to speak
1:01:12 for like everyone or every company
1:01:14 because i think there are some companies
1:01:15 maybe that are more open to that which
1:01:17 is great then and then definitely put it
1:01:19 and i think in general just do put it on
1:01:21 your cv it's something you accomplished
1:01:23 and something you did from beginning to
1:01:25 end that also says something like you
1:01:26 know committing to doing that and doing
1:01:28 it putting in those hours that's in
1:01:30 itself i think also
1:01:33 something like a value added so yes
1:01:36 okay thanks yeah let's take in the last
1:01:38 one so the question from radu is what
1:01:41 advice would you give to data
1:01:43 professionals
1:01:44 to make a good impression on recruiters
1:01:48 it's not that difficult
1:01:50 no just kidding um
1:01:53 i think um
1:01:54 i don't know i i particularly enjoyed
1:01:57 recruiting and interviewing data
1:01:58 professionals
1:02:00 after i got to know them uh and i think
1:02:03 that was again like through the land
1:02:04 though i managed to like get to know a
1:02:06 lot of people and understand
1:02:08 uh you know the things they are excited
1:02:10 about and things that that excite them
1:02:12 so if you like want to impress a
1:02:13 recruiter i think
1:02:14 um
1:02:16 um
1:02:19 uh try to answer the questions like as
1:02:21 much as possible and like try to think
1:02:23 about like you're speaking to someone
1:02:25 who doesn't understand anything probably
1:02:27 and i don't want to like just you know
1:02:29 talk badly about recruiters a lot of us
1:02:31 do do try to understand machine learning
1:02:33 and we can you know
1:02:35 sometimes tell the difference but uh but
1:02:37 yeah um yeah just like try to explain as
1:02:40 much as possible in words that you know
1:02:42 like um
1:02:44 uh that are maybe not as technical but
1:02:46 also like uh yeah having that in mind
1:02:49 knowing that speaking to someone who's
1:02:51 not a technical person so sometimes you
1:02:53 know i would speak to someone and i'd
1:02:55 ask a question that would be more
1:02:56 open-ended questions but they would
1:02:58 answer with yes or no and that's kind of
1:03:01 okay i really need to know a little bit
1:03:03 more to understand like you know your
1:03:04 motivation or like why you know you're
1:03:06 doing this or what you did and um and so
1:03:09 coming prepared for the interview and
1:03:11 that doesn't necessarily mean like
1:03:12 knowing everything about the company you
1:03:14 are interviewing it at but
1:03:17 prepared like you know having some
1:03:18 specific examples as i said about the
1:03:20 behavior questions they typically not
1:03:22 very varied they're usually about
1:03:24 similar values the companies you know
1:03:26 want kind of
1:03:28 you know someone who's a team player so
1:03:30 the questions would be around that or if
1:03:32 you were more in a senior role in
1:03:33 leadership like you know how you let the
1:03:35 team how big was it and like can you
1:03:36 give me an example of you know how would
1:03:38 you grow someone so try to ahead of that
1:03:41 try to think about like you know the
1:03:42 interview will probably ask you
1:03:43 questions with spec for specific
1:03:45 examples so
1:03:46 try to come up with specific examples as
1:03:48 opposed to um
1:03:51 hypothetical scenarios
1:03:52 um like what would i do if i was in this
1:03:55 situation i think that's the kind of
1:03:57 like a wishful thinking so like yeah um
1:04:00 but um
1:04:01 also um
1:04:04 uh come up with questions and like
1:04:07 i mean
1:04:08 um
1:04:09 like if you really i mean if you're
1:04:10 really of course motivated you're
1:04:12 actually interested in joining the
1:04:13 company that recruiter is representing
1:04:15 um uh then
1:04:18 then yeah then ask questions about the
1:04:19 company or the culture because um
1:04:21 sometimes it could mean like if someone
1:04:23 is not really asking those questions i
1:04:26 would sometimes wonder like are they
1:04:27 really interested in this company maybe
1:04:29 they're just interviewing with two other
1:04:30 and that's what they're waiting for and
1:04:32 this is kind of like okay well i do it
1:04:34 because why not you know um
1:04:37 and and you know and another thing is i
1:04:40 think it's also about the commitment so
1:04:42 sometimes um
1:04:44 if things change of course and as i said
1:04:46 also about the seller expectations
1:04:47 things change but i think
1:04:49 just explain so if if you like um
1:04:53 it's it's about like i guess respecting
1:04:55 people's time and i know that recruiters
1:04:57 also can be quite um difficult about
1:05:00 that or not very good with that so i
1:05:02 understand that there are some
1:05:03 recruiters who you know don't really
1:05:05 keep you posted they don't say what
1:05:06 happened you never hear from them after
1:05:09 you were rejected but um but if you like
1:05:11 you know interviewing with many
1:05:12 companies and some company makes you an
1:05:13 offer and you like like let the
1:05:15 recruiter as soon as possible know that
1:05:17 actually i don't want to interview with
1:05:19 you anymore because i got this offer and
1:05:21 that's fine so you don't wasting you're
1:05:23 not wasting their time
1:05:24 um
1:05:26 and be open about that that you yes i am
1:05:28 interviewing like we are expecting that
1:05:30 you will be interviewing with other
1:05:31 companies like i'm not gonna you know
1:05:34 uh be offended that oh no like this
1:05:36 person also is interviewing there that's
1:05:38 bad um and uh i think yeah and then with
1:05:42 the offers i think
1:05:44 once you accept an offer verbally uh
1:05:47 with a given company
1:05:49 to me that's like okay that's like it's
1:05:51 not of course legally binding even
1:05:52 though actually if we make an offer to
1:05:54 you
1:05:55 in most of european countries it is
1:05:56 legally binding um but um but i would
1:05:59 expect them that you will honor that and
1:06:01 that's something that's your commitment
1:06:03 but i did have sometimes instances when
1:06:05 people would accept the offer or even
1:06:07 sign the contract and then
1:06:08 a week later say like oh i got this
1:06:10 other offer now um can i
1:06:13 can we negotiate this like this whole
1:06:15 thing again because i got more money or
1:06:17 something else happened
1:06:19 and that to me is a kind of that was a
1:06:21 bit like um makes you wonder if the
1:06:24 person really wants to be here um
1:06:26 i it's totally fine if you get more
1:06:28 money from another company and you want
1:06:29 to join them just don't accept the offer
1:06:31 before that so
1:06:32 uh different situations but at least
1:06:34 communicate as much as possible and
1:06:38 and explain the kind of the situation i
1:06:40 think we are that's yeah what i would do
1:06:43 yeah thanks thanks for the advice how
