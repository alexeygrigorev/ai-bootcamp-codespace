0:42 slack Community join it if you want to
0:45 hang out with other data enthusiasts
0:47 during today's interview you can ask any
0:49 question you want there is a pinned Link
0:51 in the live chat click on this link ask
0:54 your question and I will be covering
0:55 these questions during the interview
0:58 and by the way there is one more link
1:00 in the description which is about our
1:03 envelopes course data strategy and
1:05 envelopes maybe are not super related
1:06 but if by any chance you are into
1:09 envelopes and you do not know about our
1:11 free course there is a link that you can
1:13 check there I will shut up right now
1:16 stop sharing my screen
1:18 and find the document that we prepared
1:21 for you
1:24 okay I think I have it
1:29 we take a sip of water
1:31 yeah perfect
1:35 is it buoyant or buoyant that's that's a
1:38 good question like everybody gets it
1:40 wrong so you can say boy and I mean
1:42 Germany it's a bit easier to say boy oh
1:44 yeah correct but how do you say it
1:47 yeah okay
1:51 I'll try my best so this week we'll talk
1:55 about data strategy and we have a
1:57 special guest today boyan boyan is a
1:59 data strategist with the decade of
2:00 experience in various academic
2:02 commercial environments such as
2:04 bioinformatics clinical trials HR Tech
2:07 legal Tech and management consulting
2:10 he is an author of two books one of them
2:12 is elements of data strategy and the
2:14 other one is Python and R for the modern
2:16 data scientist currently he is leading
2:19 the data strategy function at Exeter AG
2:22 I hope I pronounce it correctly which is
2:25 a large technology company that focuses
2:27 on the German speech and speaking region
2:29 of the world and he is running also
2:32 running a digital transformation
2:33 consultancy so welcome well yeah hello
2:38 I'm glad to be here glad to talk about
2:40 data strategy the favorite topic
2:43 as usual the questions for today's
2:45 interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer
2:47 thanks Johanna for your help so now
2:49 let's start before we go into our main
2:52 topic of data strategy design let's
2:55 start with your background can you tell
2:57 us about your career Journey so far yeah
2:59 I think that's uh that's that's the
3:01 favorite question I mean in the my
3:03 career I think it took me quite many
3:04 different places I think for especially
3:07 for your audience it's interesting to
3:08 hear because I was a data scientist
3:10 before there was such a thing I would
3:12 say I think it was right on the edge of
3:14 that so I studied actually biochemistry
3:16 cell biology
3:17 after these complete feedbacks and I
3:20 started to do a master status which was
3:23 was a bit more computational that's
3:25 where I started to code
3:26 and around the time I I wondered what
3:29 should I do with my life and being able
3:31 to code knowing a bit of Statistics you
3:34 know than I've heard in the US they have
3:36 this title data scientist and I thought
3:38 well let me try Germany and in Germany
3:40 you know you're because I studied in
3:42 Germany normally people really care
3:44 about your background uh in so I was
3:48 very lucky that the startups don't so
3:50 the startups look at me and said yeah
3:51 actually if you can code if you know
3:53 things about data you can be a data
3:56 scientist
3:57 so I got the title I got the job and I
3:59 spent the first half of my career being
4:01 a data scientist for all those kind of
4:03 different startups mostly and that was
4:05 fun I learned a lot I learned also a lot
4:07 how not to do things which I think is
4:09 also useful
4:11 and kind of to the end of my second half
4:14 of my career it was a bit like another
4:17 accident happened to me because I was
4:19 seeing myself as a more introverted
4:21 person and going into Consulting wasn't
4:23 an obvious thing for me to be honest but
4:27 I tried and I loved it so there I got
4:29 the very strange title data strategist
4:31 which even at the time people don't
4:33 didn't understand and now I think we
4:35 still uh there's still a lot of work to
4:37 be done there so hopefully I can help a
4:39 bit with that today
4:40 so I spent some years there I did a data
4:44 strategy for somebody for a company and
4:47 they invited me to be the CTO after that
4:49 so it was funny thing because it shows
4:51 you if you do a data strategy then
4:53 easily you can transition to a different
4:55 role
4:56 but also we have a sink in Bulgarian
4:58 which means you have to eat the soup you
5:00 cook so it was funny because I had to
5:02 make the data strategy then I had to go
5:04 and implement this and it's of course
5:05 very challenging so we can talk about
5:07 this today as well and yeah I was the
5:09 CTO of this company that was more it's a
5:12 really focused on data business so that
5:13 was really obvious as the data
5:15 strategies that would fit
5:17 uh at some point uh though we weren't
5:20 successful unfortunate like how many
5:22 startups are and I uh really wanted to
5:25 go back to Consulting and this is around
5:28 the time when I finished my second book
5:29 about data strategy and I thought okay
5:32 now yeah I really have unfinished
5:34 business there so this is why I'm back
5:35 in Consulting ethics that where as you
5:38 said like a leader date strategy
5:39 function here and working with all kinds
5:42 of clients on on the topic is by far my
5:44 favorite topic data strategy yeah
5:47 so how how did it happen that you were
5:50 called a data strategist so you said or
5:52 maybe my impression was that it happened
5:54 kind of by accident
5:57 yeah I went into Consulting by accident
5:59 and that company they had the data
6:01 strategist as a title and I looked at it
6:04 at first I was thinking well okay that's
6:05 uh interesting you know I'm a data
6:08 scientist so yeah is this something for
6:10 me or not right so
6:12 um at that point I started to realize
6:14 actually I do know I I'm comfortable and
6:16 do enjoy the things around data science
6:19 and I thought let me try this out
6:21 because there was a lot of unfamiliar
6:23 words to be honest and this is the
6:24 reason why I wrote the second book
6:25 because I got the title and I started to
6:28 ask uh yeah what do I do now as a data
6:30 strategist because you get the
6:32 requirement from your company which is
6:35 like yeah make data projects successful
6:37 and yeah go have fun right I mean which
6:40 is everything without the coding part
6:42 yeah uh and that was challenging right I
6:46 asked a lot the raw wasn't super defined
6:48 it was kind of this uh purple people you
6:50 often call them I think uh there was a
6:53 mention of that yeah I heard this there
6:55 was a article I think from DVC this data
6:59 versioning Tool uh one of the people
7:01 there they they mentioned that they're
7:03 these purple people I don't know why why
7:05 that's the name but uh the people who
7:07 are kind of in between technology and
7:09 data and between technology and business
7:11 right
7:15 yeah kind of kind of yeah data product
7:18 managers you know when I wrote my book I
7:20 asked that question how do you call such
7:21 people is it data strategies the right
7:23 title uh and I haven't found a better
7:26 one I think it's cool to say data
7:28 product manager I think that that kind
7:30 of feels right
7:31 because actually it's not all we do is a
7:34 data strategy that's a big confusion
7:35 which current people think all we do is
7:37 a data strategy well actually eighty
7:40 percent of the work is implementing a
7:42 strategy
7:43 but that doesn't come from the title
7:46 so that's how it happened that's how it
7:48 became a data strategist but the skills
7:50 weren't defined uh it was really the
7:52 requirement was yeah get value from data
7:55 without coding basically yeah and I had
7:57 to find my way this is actually why I
7:59 wrote the book try to Define it a bit
8:01 yeah actually I did this Venn diagram of
8:03 skills you know the data science Venn
8:05 diagram right that was the
8:08 that was the original thing in data
8:09 science we had the same thing if you
8:11 remember many years ago yes I do so data
8:15 strategies getting value of data without
8:17 coding right
8:20 and if you can give a
8:22 [Music]
8:24 I don't know yeah definition more
8:27 precise yes
8:28 the data strategy uh this is technically
8:33 a plan to get value from data
8:37 this plan has to be actionable and it
8:41 has to be flexible enough to be changed
8:42 when in operation
8:45 and this plan it has to contain a lot of
8:48 information right you often see I think
8:52 on LinkedIn sometimes you see when
8:53 people say data strategy and you have a
8:55 list of goals right a list of goals is
8:57 not a strategy this is always obsessed
9:00 me when I see that a strategy uh it's
9:03 it's normally a very big document
9:06 and that's actually a dangerous thing
9:08 but in this document what you do you
9:12 um I can talk about the phases because
9:14 in the book I split the process of doing
9:16 data strategy in phases but one
9:18 important thing to say here is a
9:20 strategy cannot be static that's a big
9:22 mistake right you have some kind of
9:24 plans
9:25 for your data teams for your data
9:28 products projects and then things don't
9:31 work out right it's very typical
9:33 scenario right somebody does a data
9:34 strategy and nothing happens so I'm very
9:36 focused on
9:38 making a data strategy which is flexible
9:40 and iterative right you do make this
9:42 static document at the beginning
9:44 normally it's a deck actually but then
9:47 uh uh you you have to really be able to
9:50 change this and there's a lot of
9:51 artifacts actually connected to to the
9:53 deck it's not just I can give you one
9:55 example a data dictionary for example
9:58 would be a part of the due diligence of
10:01 a data strategy so you can imagine this
10:03 deck and you have a big confidence page
10:04 which contains a dictionary of the data
10:08 Associated use case so just as an
10:10 example how specific you can get
10:12 yeah so it's still a bit abstract to me
10:16 like okay we have a deck which is which
10:18 describes the strategy yeah I know that
10:20 strategy is a big document it can yeah
10:22 static and then there are some other
10:24 artifacts like data dictionary but then
10:27 maybe you have like a more concrete
10:28 example like what exactly is in this
10:30 deck yeah maybe I can go into the to the
10:33 to the process then of data strategy so
10:35 uh you can't tell a company what to do
10:38 if you don't know where they are so it's
10:40 a classic mistake you hire somebody to
10:42 give you a plan but you can't make a
10:44 plan if you don't know what's there
10:46 already this is a very classic example
10:48 especially in big companies right you
10:50 have to spend a lot of time at the
10:51 beginning figuring things out
10:53 I mean you know like when you do a data
10:56 science so let's say a machine learning
10:57 project
10:58 uh you can't just say yeah we do need to
11:02 make a churn model
11:04 and then wait for Success that doesn't
11:06 work so you have to see what data you
11:07 have first
11:08 that's the most important thing so
11:10 that's the due diligence part
11:12 and that takes a while the due diligence
11:15 part is you're not
11:16 strategizing is really mostly about
11:19 figuring out where the company is uh and
11:22 first you have to find out what the
11:23 goals of the company are I even had this
11:26 discussion today with my team actually
11:27 how do you do it with clients because
11:29 every business has some kind of
11:32 a point right it wouldn't be a business
11:34 let's say you're you're a company which
11:36 sells socks right I mean let's take a
11:38 basic example and then you have a data
11:41 team and you can imagine yeah the goal
11:43 is to sell more stocks faster
11:45 yeah and taking this yeah yeah so we
11:49 have a company that sells socks yeah the
11:51 goal of the company is to sell more
11:54 socks yeah let's say more socks faster
11:57 let's make it a bit more yeah
12:01 clear and then we have a data team in
12:03 this company whose goal because they
12:06 work also at the Sox company
12:08 is the same goal as the internet should
12:10 be it should be but this is where the
12:12 strategy comes in right because normally
12:14 what happens is in these companies is
12:15 like uh the sea level people think let's
12:18 hire a bunch of data scientists right
12:21 and tell them exactly this yeah Help Us
12:23 sell more stocks faster at a better
12:26 price uh and that's literally how it is
12:28 actually and then the data scientists
12:30 you know they're like uh yeah but the
12:32 data and this and that and that and we
12:34 do need data Engineers we do need some
12:36 kind of cloud platform we do need a
12:38 budget for this what type of skills do
12:40 we do we do we need you know this
12:41 becomes a mess very quickly
12:43 uh so this really what's happened in
12:45 Germany after this campaigns realized
12:47 how we do need data Engineers as well
12:50 right because somebody needs to make the
12:52 data available somebody needs to set up
12:54 the infrastructure and now what happens
12:56 is companies realize how we need data
12:58 strategies as well because somebody
13:01 needs to uh see how do you go from
13:04 selling more stocks faster to ah you
13:08 know actually if you do a trail model
13:10 for a socks customer that somehow
13:12 contributes to that goal right and this
13:15 translation how does one uh more
13:17 technical
13:19 impact contributes to the business one
13:22 that's very hard that's really hard to
13:24 find the right the right thing to do
13:26 mm-hmm so that's uh that part yeah I
13:30 think I more or less understand but it's
13:32 I'm still a bit confused so let's say we
13:34 have a goal
13:35 to sell more stocks faster right and
13:39 then we
13:41 so what exactly goes to the strategy
13:43 because in order to implement this model
13:45 we need to have like the data
13:47 infrastructure yeah actual data data
13:49 Engineers we need to have the platform
13:51 we need to know to hire
13:54 does this go into the deck with the
13:57 strategy yeah correct I think I have to
13:59 jump a bit forward and then go back
14:00 again because now we go into the design
14:02 phase let's say you you what you did in
14:05 due diligence you find out about use
14:06 cases they are do they have a cloud
14:08 environment how does data look like what
14:10 type of people are there you know this
14:13 is like sync was there let's say you
14:15 know the where the company is what is
14:16 there now we have to design the strategy
14:18 and the first thing you do is use case
14:21 ideation right you basically have a look
14:23 at what use case or possible mentioned
14:27 the term model that's uh that's one use
14:29 case but maybe you can make some kind of
14:30 recommendation agents for the online
14:32 shop right to sell socks that's another
14:34 use case you can find probably 10 15 you
14:37 know for any business right
14:38 uh so that's that's the easy part
14:42 because coming up with ideas you do need
14:45 to have some experience again this is
14:46 actually data strategies work because
14:48 you do need to have seen many use cases
14:51 but then what becomes very hard actually
14:54 charge GPT can help you here a lot you
14:57 could technically ask what are the use
14:59 cases of selling socks you know in that
15:01 example maybe it's stupid but you can
15:03 say whatever use case of selling flowers
15:05 or chairs how do we do we use data
15:09 science to sell chairs you know and you
15:10 can get a lot of nice ideas but the hard
15:13 part comes here it's why a data
15:14 strategist needs to understand technical
15:16 things is the feasibility part right
15:19 easy to come up with ideas but what's
15:21 feasible is very hard and here you take
15:24 the results from the first phase due
15:27 diligence look at them because you know
15:29 now what the data is there how the what
15:31 the skills of the people are you don't
15:33 know all of this we can say for the
15:35 recommendation agent we have the right
15:37 people we have the right data to have
15:38 the right infrastructure let's do it
15:41 there we have the prioritization part
15:43 as well right because then you need to
15:45 see you know okay let's say if you make
15:48 a recommendation agent for the online
15:49 shop for socks uh uh how important is
15:52 this and you take the feasibility
15:55 and the importance the business impact
15:57 and then you prioritize that's a bit
15:59 easier normally but again here the hard
16:01 part is actually the technical
16:02 understanding and this is what most
16:04 companies mess up still is like you make
16:07 some ideas and then you make a strategy
16:10 and then when the people start to
16:11 implement it's not feasible right and
16:13 this is very hard to know what's
16:15 feasible or not
16:16 and for that you really need to know
16:20 what is there right so what kind of
16:21 thing yeah and this process uh I ideate
16:24 feasibility and prioritization really
16:26 this Triad is like the standard thing
16:30 and to be honest after this you do need
16:31 to do other several other things which
16:33 come into the data strategy you have to
16:35 set up the target architecture and
16:37 Technology because let's see now you
16:39 know what the use cases are and here
16:41 there's something I want to talk a bit
16:42 about it has the fancy name influence
16:45 Cascade
16:46 I'll give you a concrete example let's
16:48 say uh we have a churn model
16:52 and we you we use tabular data right
16:55 through that like very standard
16:56 numerical numerical stuff and for
17:00 whatever reason uh and we build the
17:02 whole we build the API we build the
17:03 whole the whole product and it's done
17:06 but for them for whatever reason then
17:08 the uh the success it's not very
17:10 successful right because
17:12 we didn't take the right data the right
17:15 people weren't involved we didn't know
17:17 how to measure this some many reasons
17:19 why it's not successful then you have to
17:20 go back and let's say let's take text
17:22 Data it happens this scope creep in data
17:25 projects happens all the time
17:27 but if you take text Data suddenly you
17:29 have other problems and that's why I say
17:31 cascading the product people they often
17:34 think a small change here what's the big
17:36 deal right it's just another data set oh
17:38 no now you do need more storage
17:40 uh maybe the date is PDF right
17:43 uh you do need and this is the card so
17:46 you don't need any NLP people suddenly
17:47 right
17:48 and then the whole thing breaks down
17:50 start from the beginning this is why you
17:51 do the use case stuff first and then you
17:54 do Target architecture like because if
17:56 you change the use case you change
17:58 everything
17:59 so this way that's the first step
18:01 um yeah but this is a design process
18:03 there's a few other steps there like
18:04 data governance and operating model
18:07 which are a bit more standard as the
18:09 operating model basically what uh how do
18:12 people operate together do you set up
18:14 like a hybrid team do you set up uh like
18:18 a centralized Center effects on Steam
18:20 all of that right
18:22 so the goal of this deck of having this
18:27 data strategy or that is the output from
18:30 a data strategist is to join a company
18:33 first understand what is there then come
18:37 up with some cases come up with uh this
18:40 uh architecture targeted architecture
18:42 and all these things like uh you know
18:45 designing this thing then thinking about
18:47 data governance operating the people
18:49 right yeah
18:50 operating mode
18:52 and then we have this deck right and
18:55 then what happens next there's the
18:57 million dollar question that is the
18:58 Miller dockage because even if you do a
19:00 great data strategy you have the right
19:02 use case of the right people everything
19:03 is correct it is static
19:06 right and the world is very complex uh
19:08 having such a deck already you have
19:10 fixed a lot of problems which would
19:12 happen anyways because people are
19:14 supposedly gonna work on the right
19:15 things the right people at the right
19:17 time right you have a roadmap so I
19:19 forgot to mention this and you're ready
19:20 to start working but this is the whole
19:23 third part of the book actually of my
19:24 process is delivery
19:26 and that's I'll be honest with you this
19:28 is the hardest hardest part uh and I I
19:31 personally haven't figured this out
19:32 completely because here is where you
19:36 face the reality uh what there's three
19:38 elements here I have added uh in my in
19:41 my model uh one is impact assessment
19:44 another one is portfolio management and
19:47 the third one is data Ops
19:49 let's start with the first ones because
19:52 the less controversial so impact
19:53 assessment
19:55 you do need to set up some kind of a
19:57 baseline let's say let's take the socks
19:59 again right so let's say you have a data
20:00 strategy hey you're in a sock selling
20:03 business uh and you remember the initial
20:06 goal right selling more socks faster
20:08 uh I mean that that should be measurable
20:12 with any good business unfortunately
20:13 often it's not but let's assume it is
20:15 let's say the business unit measures
20:17 that right it's a big assumption
20:19 honestly for many companies but let's
20:21 say they do measure that
20:23 so then you really have to have a look
20:25 in your data team from time to time and
20:28 really every several months have a look
20:30 well the chair model the recommendation
20:32 agent is four or five use cases they are
20:34 now being worked on and deployed does it
20:37 move the needle somewhere
20:39 right and that's very hard but you do
20:41 need to have these check-ins because
20:42 then you can adjust
20:44 right let's say people spend a lot of
20:46 time on the chair model and then you see
20:48 yeah you kind of
20:49 yeah it does improve the selling of
20:52 stocks because less customers churn uh
20:55 but it's hard to measure and here you
20:57 have you'll have a lot of Statistics a b
20:59 testing and all of those things you can
21:00 do
21:01 uh but the price of US maintaining this
21:04 is not worth it so we have to refocus on
21:07 something else so you completely scrub
21:09 that use case even the part of the
21:10 architecture and move to something else
21:12 and this is the
21:15 from the results from the impact
21:16 assessment you go to portfolio man yeah
21:18 sorry sorry do you do this actually
21:20 after implementing so let's say we
21:22 implemented this chart model
21:24 we run it we did the a b test we see
21:26 that there is positive impact but then
21:28 we also did some calculations and see
21:30 that the cost of having this team having
21:32 this structure is outrageous like it's
21:34 just too large it does not like it's not
21:37 worth the impact it gives us right and
21:39 then we say okay like let's
21:41 yeah
21:43 yeah this is the portfolio management
21:45 but you have several use case that's the
21:47 character you have to have a look at all
21:49 of them at the same time it's not it's a
21:51 qualitative measure often unfortunately
21:53 I think and there's hidden costs right
21:55 like the teams supporting them are
21:58 expensive and I don't know uh you do it
22:01 during you can do it obviously
22:02 immediately after the start but most
22:04 data projects you can go for you can do
22:06 a pilot in a matter of weeks
22:08 uh uh then you can start measuring but
22:11 you do need the Baseline because what
22:12 happens here is people forget about this
22:14 is if you don't have a baseline let's
22:17 say or you just started working you
22:20 didn't set up some kind of metric at the
22:21 beginning will you think okay come on
22:23 let's let's see we're gonna see results
22:24 you get the result at the end right at
22:27 some point you measure the churn rate
22:28 but you didn't know what the chain rate
22:30 was at the beginning
22:32 so you you go to the business owners and
22:34 tell them uh yeah we did this and
22:37 they'll tell you so how bad there is the
22:38 situation
22:40 from before so you have to set up this
22:43 at the beginning and that's really
22:44 something which very easy to forget that
22:47 you didn't before the project look at
22:49 the business metric that's the number
22:51 and then two months later you can you
22:53 can really say yeah we improve this with
22:55 two percent I mean here the hard part
22:57 comes Which business unit contributed
22:59 the most to this right uh but at least
23:02 you have some kind of a start yeah
23:06 stuff
23:08 yeah and detox maybe we can talk about
23:11 this because this is a very
23:13 uh I say it's controversial because
23:15 people it's like the world date of
23:17 product people think data product you
23:19 know data mesh word is defined in one
23:21 way
23:22 um people uh think about data assets
23:26 uh so very different things what I mean
23:28 by data helps maybe we can start with
23:31 data product because
23:33 this is what the data strategy is about
23:36 right about data products yeah I did
23:40 change my mind on this one right uh I
23:43 because I wrote data product I wrote
23:46 about data products but to be honest
23:48 like uh
23:50 it should be a data and AI powered
23:53 products yeah data product is something
23:55 else data product it should be just the
23:57 data I mean I I made a bit of a circle
23:59 and I just joined the data mesh
24:01 definition of that right it's just the
24:03 data itself without the use case my view
24:06 in the book was a data product is data
24:08 plus use case
24:10 uh but I don't want to compete with the
24:12 more popular definition which is just
24:14 the data and I think the Architectural
24:17 Components around it is with the data
24:19 Quantum in the data mesh where it's a
24:20 bit more uh bigger but what I talk about
24:23 is data and AI powered products
24:25 it's like uh API endpoint for machine
24:29 learning mode which predicts churn in
24:31 Salesforce so that's data and AI powered
24:33 products with an AI feature so this is
24:36 when I say data product I
24:38 so you have some data and then there is
24:40 a specific use case on top of this data
24:42 yeah that's exactly correct that that is
24:44 a data and AI power product and
24:46 technically we should say we talk about
24:47 data and AI for product managers you
24:50 know but it's a bit of a mouthful but
24:52 data product we should leave it at the
24:54 data level without the use case I think
24:57 okay there's now let's talk about data
25:00 Ops but then there is also an
25:01 interesting question that I want to ask
25:03 the data data Ops is a tricky tricky
25:06 term uh people mean different things
25:07 again in the book It's a combination
25:10 between agile and lean it's just a
25:11 methodology
25:15 um
25:15 and uh with the with the
25:18 like cicd angle to it right and to be
25:22 honest this is like there's a lot of
25:24 ideas there and here's one book
25:25 recommendation I'll give it at the end
25:27 as well but agile data Ops the book
25:30 uh
25:32 uh and the idea is I mentioned lean and
25:35 agile like this age of working data
25:37 science is my favorite question short
25:39 answer it doesn't
25:41 but it's maybe it's like democracy is
25:43 like not great but it's the best we've
25:45 got you know I could say uh but
25:48 um agile in data what I talked in the
25:50 book I have this interviews with data
25:52 data leaders practical data leaders and
25:54 they all said yeah you could do Agile
25:56 but in a software right you have to be
25:57 careful about requirements
26:00 um uh because it's very hard to measure
26:03 certain things especially at the
26:04 beginning so I'll leave the Azure topic
26:07 a bit because the lean part that's
26:09 fascinating in that book uh having their
26:12 ad file is one of my favorite authors
26:13 that book is brilliant he took the ideas
26:16 from Lean Manufacturing
26:19 cars and conveyor belts uh to to data
26:23 right and the focus there it's not on
26:26 doing the right things but avoiding the
26:28 wrong things and this is so amazing in
26:30 data science engineering because it's
26:32 hard to know what the writing is but
26:34 everybody knows the wrong thing so
26:36 basically he focuses on how date the
26:38 people waste their time
26:39 and energy like definitions have done
26:43 director the book you're talking about
26:46 is a gel agile data Ops right oh
26:48 practical data Ops I have to check this
26:50 but uh and uh literally how how much
26:54 time people data scientists spend
26:55 waiting really concrete measurable
26:58 things and just avoiding them and that's
26:59 brilliant I think that's a brilliant way
27:01 to manage data projects you don't focus
27:03 on the what's good you focus on what's
27:05 better
27:08 by the way we I think we have two
27:12 podcast interviews podcast episodes
27:14 about dataops
27:16 um so you can check them out for more
27:17 details the question I see and it's
27:21 quite an interesting one because I also
27:22 wanted to ask you that what is the
27:25 difference between a data strategic data
27:28 strategist and a data science strategist
27:30 because what you describe also to me
27:32 looks like it's very data science
27:34 Centric but it is not
27:37 just about data science right
27:40 Aces we have a
27:42 and dashboards yeah um yeah I mean
27:46 there's the idea that there's very nice
27:48 articles also about how data strategy is
27:50 going to split into flavors right data
27:53 strategist is the most General flavor
27:55 you could have an AI strategy somebody
27:57 who just focuses on on that part a data
28:00 strategies is just the more General uh
28:02 uh idea right because then you have like
28:06 data platforms data engineering it also
28:09 is a value right it's a bit harder to
28:10 measure the success of those right
28:12 because they can have an enabler
28:14 indirectly you don't know there's this
28:16 hierarchy of needs from uh hierarchy of
28:19 data science needs model from from
28:21 Shopify where you have the advanced use
28:24 cases on the top but you can't get to
28:26 them if you don't have like the data
28:28 platform and cloud services
28:29 infrastructure uh so data strategies is
28:32 responsible for that part too right to
28:35 set this up especially bigger companies
28:37 that's a bigger problem so I would say
28:39 that's the difference it's just the more
28:40 General one also business intelligence
28:42 reporting is also there
28:45 it's just a bit more difficult to
28:47 measure but I guess we need analytics to
28:50 be able to measure some things right
28:52 otherwise we yeah it's sometimes it's a
28:54 gradient yeah I do think we shouldn't
28:56 try to measure everything it's not
28:58 possible right you should you should at
28:59 least have an idea right I mean uh of
29:02 where things are going uh yeah but
29:05 that's why I do like this the typical
29:06 example is like when this Lighthouse
29:09 projects right to hear them big
29:11 companies want to do something very
29:12 fancy with AI which is normally the last
29:15 thing they should be doing actually this
29:17 is this ideas from Martin sugart from
29:18 that and tribal co-interuting the book
29:21 is good friend of mine and this he
29:22 really has brilliant ideas on this and
29:24 he told me once uh about Lighthouse
29:27 projects it's really the last thing a
29:28 company should do
29:29 because they it's normally a very
29:32 Advanced use case it's some kind of NLP
29:34 computer vision deep learning use case
29:36 right because that's what gets the media
29:38 attention it's amazing and things and
29:40 people like it but to do this you do
29:42 need crazy architecture crazy skills
29:44 crazy anything to move beyond beyond the
29:46 pilot what you should do instead is get
29:48 the most boring use cases like reporting
29:51 automation of reporting get that done
29:54 show the number get the money from the
29:56 business owners and then do the more
29:57 advanced things and that's his idea it's
29:59 not mine but it's a brilliant one
30:02 and then coming back to the time when
30:04 you were hired as a data strategist
30:08 as in the studio background was data
30:10 science correct yeah what skills you
30:12 needed back then to actually be able to
30:14 do this role what kind of skills like
30:17 you needed to show you have and what
30:19 kind of skills you need to develop when
30:20 you join yeah that's I can refer to the
30:23 Venn diagram but it's an exercise I did
30:24 with my colleagues back then because uh
30:26 not just me but the other data
30:28 strategies we had all the same question
30:30 what skills do we do we have we had some
30:32 people who are business people
30:34 completely business like people who just
30:36 who never call the people and they are
30:38 also data strategists right that's why
30:40 you should have different flavors
30:42 uh and I group it into three groups
30:45 right so you have the data
30:47 uh imagine a Venn diagram with three
30:49 circles right we have data we have
30:51 communication systems thinking and data
30:54 data is the whole Tech thing right it's
30:56 not just it's data science engineering
30:57 Analytics
30:59 cloud
31:01 uh communication
31:03 yeah everybody will tell you this is the
31:05 skill and it is the skill can you write
31:07 can you talk
31:08 can you explain can you translate and
31:11 this is the hardest skill of the
31:12 ultimate data strategy is kiwis
31:14 translation that's why they call them at
31:16 McKinsey analytics translators uh which
31:19 I I like as a title it doesn't sound so
31:21 cool I think it's a strategist but you
31:23 do need to to translate from the
31:25 requirements sell more stocks to chair
31:27 model and Beyond and you have to operate
31:30 on
31:31 on very different levels systems
31:34 thinking that's that's what I mean this
31:36 is the most abstract thing here which
31:38 many people would roll their eyes when
31:39 they hear this because it sounds like
31:40 management consulting thing in the book
31:43 I describe it a bit more but I'll give
31:45 you an example a typical day of mine I
31:49 I have to explain what AI is
31:54 uh and in the same day I have to look at
31:58 uh access access permissions on Azure
32:02 right
32:04 and explain how to do that part at the
32:07 same in the same day and that's the
32:08 hardest part about the job because you
32:10 have to move between those two levels
32:11 right and I do don't think a data
32:14 strategy you can't have Junior data
32:15 strategies almost I think because it's
32:17 like something you do need to get from
32:19 those different domains but you do have
32:21 the flavors of people I think
32:24 do you think it's important to have
32:25 these technical skills like explaining
32:27 roles in azure
32:30 you know this is kind of an example I
32:32 give sometimes with the understanding of
32:34 uh let's get a data science example like
32:37 support Vector machines let's take that
32:38 one and most people wouldn't understand
32:40 the math behind it but if you go on
32:43 Wikipedia and look there's this nice
32:44 diagram of separation of classes right
32:46 you have the decision boundaries right
32:48 and then you read the Wikipedia article
32:51 and you see how well there's this kernel
32:52 tricky thing it's called there's this
32:54 trick to to maximize this boundary do
32:57 you understand how supportive machine
33:00 machines for Vector machines work no you
33:02 have no idea you can't code it yourself
33:03 but you understand kind of conceptually
33:06 so this is the same level you do need to
33:08 be a data strategist you do need these
33:10 concepts of architecture you don't need
33:11 to understand
33:13 what is access water pipelines what is
33:16 orchestration you really do need to
33:17 understand this and I it's hard for me
33:20 to say I come from a technical
33:21 background uh I mean but I was a
33:23 biologist before so
33:25 uh yeah you do need to have uh
33:28 conceptual knowledge of everything in in
33:30 data for sure I think otherwise it's
33:32 very hard
33:33 but you don't have to be an expert in I
33:36 don't know
33:37 it's frustrating and on a personal I can
33:40 tell you what's frustrating about the
33:41 role because everybody knows gonna think
33:43 let me become a data strategist this
33:44 roses in unicorns you will feel stupid
33:47 all the time you'll be talking to people
33:49 who are
33:50 20 years of experience in a data
33:52 architecture
33:53 in the same day with people who have 20
33:55 years of experiences selling sales and
33:57 business and with both groups you feel
33:59 stupid because you're this weird jack of
34:01 all trades uh that kind of knows and
34:04 that you'll be judged from those two
34:06 groups on their level right so you have
34:08 to prepare yourself mentally for
34:11 yeah but on the plus side you get to do
34:13 many different things which is totally
34:15 worth it I would say
34:16 Okay cool so again skills are mostly
34:21 communication skills like you need to be
34:24 able to write read communicate and
34:27 translate right
34:28 then you need to have some
34:31 technical skills like you don't need to
34:33 be an expert but you need to know what
34:36 what is I don't know the pipeline what
34:38 is the data pipeline what is an
34:40 orchestrator like all these technical
34:41 terms so you because
34:43 somebody will need to implement this so
34:46 you need to have an idea what exactly it
34:47 is and how much for effort it requires
34:49 or maybe even you need to know like how
34:53 which tool is going to be used like okay
34:55 if we are building a data pipeline we
34:58 would use this particular tool right
35:00 at that point you can get the advice I
35:02 think I think if you for example
35:04 orchestration right airflow versus
35:06 something else right that the second
35:08 part you don't need to know I think
35:10 because the tools change every day but
35:12 you do need you know you do need to
35:14 orchestrate some scripts you can't know
35:15 what that looks like and then you find a
35:18 more competent person to help you there
35:20 okay so a data strategist is not
35:22 necessarily a data architecture no no no
35:26 no you take the strategy and
35:30 or somebody will work with you on the
35:32 strategy to actually come up with a
35:34 Target architecture everywhere
35:36 everywhere you had somebody working with
35:38 you like in the business side you're
35:40 also somebody is going to work with you
35:41 on every of those sites it's like a row
35:43 which alone is totally pointless destroy
35:46 is an enabler only right it's completely
35:48 pointless without other people
35:50 so does it mean that the
35:53 company who wants to hire a data
35:55 strategist already needs to have all
35:57 these places in place and all these
35:59 people in place before they hire data
36:01 strategists
36:05 with uh
36:07 um it's hard to say if you're if you're
36:09 a smaller company just starting out you
36:11 do need the data strategies but they
36:12 will be called CDO Chief data officer
36:15 head of data I think ahead of data
36:18 science has to be a data strategist you
36:21 know
36:21 teamlet of data science has to be a bit
36:23 of a data strategist so this kind of
36:25 more managerial role of teamly they have
36:27 to be a data strategist actually and you
36:30 do need to hire them at the start to
36:31 know what you're going to do I think
36:34 okay let's say I work as a senior data
36:37 scientist and now I listen to this
36:39 podcast episode and
36:41 I think okay this is so cool I want to
36:43 do to be a data Scientologist so how do
36:46 I go about that
36:48 um you have to learn a lot of business
36:51 you really have to learn a lot of
36:52 business and
36:54 you have to let go of a lot of things
36:57 you have to start to understand that
37:00 um because you as I said you will feel
37:02 stupid this will be new to you and if
37:04 your senior data scientist you feel like
37:06 uh at that point that your career
37:08 already feel your ego is already high
37:10 because if you're okay I have learned so
37:12 much I can do anything well now you
37:14 start from scratch because suddenly you
37:16 have to understand uh like very like how
37:20 businesses work uh and that's that's
37:22 it's easy to underestimate but you do
37:25 need to start from the beginning so
37:27 first understand how businesses work
37:29 talk in your company to uh recording
37:31 functional leadership so talk to
37:34 uh the head of marketing and go to them
37:37 and ask them so how can data help you
37:39 and this is the first start that's the
37:41 first start because then you start to
37:43 understand what they want
37:45 um and try to align uh your chair model
37:48 to the socks selling right and talk to
37:50 the people who sell the socks
37:52 and you work in that area and of course
37:56 I would say get the book the book won't
37:57 make your data strategies but it will
37:59 give you like exactly the
38:01 the typical things that you need to do
38:03 the activities right
38:05 but you have to go and do the work
38:07 actually you have to be comfortable of
38:09 stopping being a data scientist because
38:11 you work with very vague things
38:13 and normally these are uncomfortable for
38:15 for technical people who want to be
38:17 specific
38:18 I would say and and the worst is you
38:20 have to work on different levels
38:22 in the same day and this is what's also
38:25 going to happen if you transition to
38:26 that because as I said like in the in
38:29 the morning you talk about business and
38:30 then you have to write some python in
38:32 the afternoon and that becomes a problem
38:34 very fast I would say so yeah why
38:38 um I think the the focus you do need to
38:40 prepare uh I mean in the same day in in
38:43 several different days I think it's
38:45 great because your brain is uh active in
38:47 many different levels but in the same
38:48 way personally for me it was always
38:50 challenging to switch the focus that
38:51 fast right because I think about
38:54 business I think in an abstract way I
38:55 get interrupted also operationally but
38:58 if you have to write code in the same
39:00 day I think it's a challenge but between
39:01 the days it's amazing I think if you can
39:03 be a data strategist for two days and
39:05 three days a data scientists maybe
39:06 that's a good idea
39:09 so coming back to your point of learning
39:11 more about the business or learning a
39:12 lot of business you mentioned that you
39:14 need to talk to functional leaders way
39:17 out of Marketing kind of product maybe
39:19 like all people who
39:22 know do something and then you come to
39:24 them and say how can data help you but
39:27 they have no idea right like who is this
39:29 person
39:30 so how can you make it clear what
39:33 exactly you can help them with then you
39:36 may then just tell them well ask them
39:38 what they do and then because they
39:39 understand you ask them what they do
39:40 they sell the socks and then they start
39:42 talking about customers and then you get
39:45 this idea oh right maybe we can split we
39:47 can do a customer segmentation model
39:48 right you have to read about the use
39:51 cases in your area
39:52 which is easy if you're in a
39:55 non-standard area it's hard if you're in
39:56 a it's easy in a standard area but it's
39:59 hard if you do something very specific
40:02 um but then if you think about use cases
40:04 and already prepared before those
40:06 meetings you can give them those ideas
40:07 and they'll ask you okay tell me what is
40:09 the customer segmentation model then you
40:11 have to be able to translate right and
40:14 you mess it up the first time because
40:16 just by saying customer segmentation
40:18 mode you already messed up you should
40:20 say yeah we have this way of separating
40:22 the target groups you know and we can
40:24 identify them if you say this yeah there
40:26 you go but trust me if you say the
40:28 moment you say something you feel smart
40:32 not so smart and they don't understand
40:34 so that's actually that's that's the
40:36 biggest challenge that's communication
40:37 yeah okay and the only way to learn this
40:41 is by doing right so you just approach
40:43 differently yeah but very like this uh
40:46 how people should learn to play guitar
40:48 you can just play guitar but you have to
40:51 have this I think deliberate practice
40:53 right
40:54 can you have to do it deliberately to
40:56 put yourself in an uncomfortable
40:57 positions right where you have to
40:59 translate you can't just uh you really
41:02 have to uh
41:03 uh deliberately learn yeah and it's not
41:07 easy I would say but the results are
41:08 amazing I think you get to work on to be
41:10 honest I said it's hard but on the plus
41:12 side you'll be very active in
41:14 um in supporting the business you work
41:16 on many different projects many
41:18 different things
41:19 your brain will always be excited about
41:21 new things new technologies
41:23 uh and as I said this is a gateway to
41:26 other positions right I became a CTO
41:27 after that so
41:30 yeah by the way how did it happen like
41:32 how exactly
41:34 the transition happen for you yeah they
41:37 they really like the data strategy which
41:39 is like that was the biggest compliment
41:41 to me right if you do like the data
41:43 strategy and it was just a data strategy
41:46 it was not a technology strategy I had
41:48 to do that after that right and that's
41:50 very different
41:51 uh but they liked my Approach they liked
41:54 that it was concrete they like this
41:56 translation skills and this translation
41:57 skill is the hardest thing in technology
41:59 right I think with the GPT stuff uh
42:02 coming up where do we go to escape from
42:05 that and I would say we should go to
42:06 those middle translating positions
42:09 because that's very hard I think
42:11 very few people can do this I think
42:13 translate and that was very attractive
42:15 to them because as a CTO that's what you
42:17 do all day you translate
42:21 can you tell us more about the skills
42:22 you needed for University one how was it
42:25 different from being a data strategist
42:27 uh the skills uh the responsibility is
42:31 much higher as a dating strategy of
42:33 course a bit obvious of course but
42:34 that's the data strategies you're in
42:36 your data corner and your strategy is
42:39 kind of a Consulting role right you
42:41 that's another thing for through people
42:43 transitioning to that your in-house
42:44 consultant you see yourself in that way
42:46 yeah your in-house consultant basically
42:49 uh it becomes different when you an
42:52 owner and you you own the whole topic
42:55 because suddenly it becomes very
42:57 operational so that's that's everything
42:59 you do because very operational you you
43:02 kind of suffer immediately the results
43:03 of your mistakes
43:06 um I had to learn even more about the
43:08 business obviously I think I knew right
43:10 but I had to learn even more you have to
43:12 learn accounting
43:13 uh you have to learn budgeting much more
43:17 uh there's a lot of management of course
43:20 is very very different role but being a
43:23 data strategist helped me prepare
43:24 because my ego was ready I was
43:26 comfortable not knowing so for me when I
43:28 needed to to uh do budgets high or
43:31 firing people I felt okay I can handle
43:33 this somehow right because of the data
43:35 strategist you're already a bit uh weird
43:38 you don't know different things already
43:40 and then you can transition to to do
43:42 something totally different I would say
43:46 yeah interesting and then this is
43:48 something I really wanted to talk to you
43:50 about because for your book you used GPT
43:55 and that's really nice that you
43:59 explicitly acknowledge that oh that's
44:02 necessary yeah that's the thing but also
44:05 like um I don't know why I'm just
44:06 thinking like do I when I feel
44:08 comfortable saying that you know all the
44:10 content I write is generated by chat TPT
44:13 uh I don't know okay but this is
44:16 necessary and I wanted to talk to you
44:19 about like how did it actually happen
44:20 like how yeah did you
44:23 organize this process how did you use
44:25 GPT
44:27 there's different different things and
44:29 I'll link to somebody else who did
44:30 something even Next Level to that so it
44:32 was at the beginning of this whole craze
44:33 you know why I I just use it in several
44:36 areas
44:37 uh only in the sidebar so for example at
44:40 some point I need to explain what middle
44:42 stand is in Germany so like this uh the
44:45 the small medium-sized companies which
44:47 carry the economy so right when you
44:48 write a book I want to write about
44:50 strategy systems thinking and I don't
44:52 want now to go to Wikipedia wherever to
44:54 find a definition paraphrase that this
44:56 is totally a complete waste of time and
44:58 energy right
44:59 absolutely pointless zero creativity in
45:02 doing that right to to write what the
45:04 definition of meter stand in a smart way
45:05 no so that's why I have these sidebars
45:08 only there and this is to be honest
45:12 um the only I like that's the you really
45:15 have to say that you did that right
45:17 because it's very obvious I think as
45:19 time goes on it's not going to be so
45:20 obvious
45:21 but I use it just for the sidebars I
45:23 have this robot icon there and for
45:25 really boring things which I think
45:26 otherwise I just have to paraphrase
45:28 right and this is what it is very good
45:30 at but ethically
45:32 somebody has to write original content
45:34 to train those models right because we
45:37 stopped feeding stack Overflow I don't
45:39 remember the last time I was there
45:41 uh and like that's down the line is
45:45 going to stop feeding the the generative
45:47 AI models right so if nobody produce
45:49 original ideas
45:51 you know we're gonna have a delayed
45:52 problem later right so that's the big
45:54 ethical number one problem of this whole
45:56 technology
45:57 is the thing is that when we stop
45:58 generating unique content
46:01 uh you can argue for the uniqueness of
46:04 GPT mapping between ideas which I do use
46:06 in my daily work as I mentioned like
46:08 let's say I do want to find use cases in
46:11 uh weird
46:13 um
46:13 maybe the the government agency which
46:16 cleans the city how do you do data
46:18 science for them right instead of me
46:19 like spending like one hour I'll just
46:22 ask yeah give me please five use cases
46:24 right and then I go deeper
46:26 for this type of stuff yeah but I think
46:28 really original original things is we're
46:31 a bit far off from there so that's my
46:33 big biggest ethical concern there
46:35 we're doing that but I can refer from
46:38 For Christoph Monarch so he's really big
46:40 in the expandable AI field he recently
46:42 published an article about how he used
46:44 that as an editor
46:48 okay I didn't do this I wasn't that was
46:51 before it was a bit early now you can do
46:53 it and I think in the future I'm open to
46:55 doing that I mean I do use grammarly for
46:57 example You could argue grammar is
46:59 actually pretty intelligent too right I
47:01 mean now they have also generative AI
47:02 features but uh grammarly also you could
47:05 argue if you use grammar list the static
47:07 or not right so it's a bit blurry the
47:09 line there but I think as an editor is a
47:13 definition engine great but anything
47:15 else I just don't see it yet but I'm not
47:18 saying it's not gonna happen
47:20 so one thing I can think of is for
47:24 example you want to write a chapter and
47:28 then for me I always have this problem
47:30 of um
47:32 um
47:33 blank page right like a blank page okay
47:36 how do I start and then you can just ask
47:38 GPT or charge GPT whatever yeah
47:41 um okay I want to write a chapter
47:44 of a book about that like and I need to
47:47 help me come up with an outline for the
47:49 chapter yeah I know I just uh you know
47:52 you need to have these sections and then
47:54 each section should have these
47:55 subsections yeah and then absolutely
47:57 absolutely yeah we have a list of uh
48:01 um bullet like bullet point lists of
48:04 what you should cover in this and then
48:05 it's so immensely helpful I mean
48:07 provided that it is correct right yeah
48:10 no that's that's for sure instead of
48:13 like I do write a lot but a lot of
48:15 PowerPoint you can imagine we have a
48:17 black PowerPoint where you do need to
48:19 say three bullet points on a topic it's
48:21 brilliant there is a start I can tell
48:24 you I haven't seen it yet that you can
48:25 just copy and paste what is it just
48:28 doesn't there's a big difference between
48:30 3.5 and 4 I have to save four is really
48:33 getting there
48:34 and with Microsoft co-pilot coming soon
48:36 I think in PowerPoint you're gonna get
48:38 some really nice new things but as you
48:39 say at the beginning it's outlining two
48:41 is great I think but the original
48:42 thought we are a bit yeah I don't know
48:44 it's going to be a very scary time
48:47 yeah but for technical book how original
48:50 you need to be
48:51 that's true yeah for a very technical
48:53 book I think that's uh that's yeah if
48:56 you want to explain it because at the
48:57 end of the day what there's a
48:58 philosophical argument would you buy a
49:00 book which is written just by by that
49:02 philosophically
49:04 you should because the technical book is
49:07 it's not about convincing you that much
49:09 you already bought a book about the rest
49:10 right but you do want to learn rust and
49:13 if that's the best way to learn it come
49:15 on like I would read it I wouldn't care
49:20 like Cadence and yeah because you do
49:23 notice it's a bit monotonous right it's
49:24 not exciting the text right and you need
49:26 to know that you can trust a book
49:29 yeah that's that's for sure yeah
49:31 check the book If nobody edit it and
49:33 nobody
49:34 yeah that's for sure
49:37 then like I would not and the references
49:39 correct yeah but that's coming I think
49:41 with the reference and Bing does that is
49:42 all a bit so I think that's
49:45 so do you think this is the future of
49:47 writing books uh of co-piloting you're
49:50 Rising hundred percent writing them uh I
49:53 don't think so is we're a long way from
49:55 uh from that I think right like
49:57 non-technical right like technical books
50:00 for sure I think we're gonna have a lot
50:03 of this right if you just have manual
50:04 tutorials that's different what is a
50:06 book then right then it becomes a
50:07 tutorial not a book no arguably
50:10 philosophically right so if it's just a
50:12 tutorial which is printed uh then yeah
50:15 you you get this which I'm not saying is
50:17 less valuable but the real book you do
50:19 need a human still there as a main pilot
50:21 for sure
50:24 people just like
50:26 one person is often not enough to relate
50:29 yes for sure
50:32 okay and by the way so speaking about
50:34 Christoph Molnar he will do and ask me
50:38 anything
50:41 yeah brilliant person brilliant like he
50:44 because I had an article about
50:45 expandable Ai and uh yeah he's just like
50:48 the the he has done so much good work
50:50 for the field brilliant underrated I
50:53 think people don't know enough about his
50:54 amazing books like several really very
50:56 strange and specific books which every
50:58 data scientist should read I would say
51:00 yeah
51:01 coming back to data strategy I think he
51:04 mentioned it at some point that it's
51:06 okay to use chat GPT or GPT whatever for
51:09 some things so how can we use chat GPT
51:13 for a data strategy design
51:16 um it's for the so you saw this is a
51:19 topic which you do weeks and weeks and
51:21 weeks and weeks right it's not a very
51:22 concrete thing and every company is
51:24 different you do the look at the use
51:25 cases the architecture it will help you
51:28 at the beginning let's say on the basic
51:31 level you work in the stocks company and
51:34 you ask what are the use cases for data
51:37 science in an e-commerce
51:39 store which sells socks right and it
51:42 will give you like all those five or six
51:44 things that's that's the most basic way
51:45 then you become more specific because
51:47 you don't know from the due diligence in
51:49 that company they use postgres they have
51:52 a lot of tax data from reviews right and
51:55 then you do some prompt engineering I
51:56 would guess and say yeah based on this
51:59 data and they're on azure
52:01 and they have a team of those people
52:04 what how should they transition to to
52:08 this architecture from this one right
52:10 and then you get some information it's
52:12 going to be a good start it's not going
52:14 to do the work though no way we're very
52:16 far from there you just get very basic
52:18 things like I don't need whatever
52:20 dynamodb for this you need this and then
52:23 but then you can if you really are going
52:25 to implement this then you go to the
52:26 coding level of charge GPT and then it's
52:28 like a different story it's a different
52:30 thing you go from strategy to Tech then
52:33 it's your best friend because then you
52:34 can really I guess move very fast and
52:37 develop things but till that point it's
52:39 a bit like brainstorming it's the same
52:40 like writing a book and outlining things
52:43 okay cool well I see that we have a
52:46 question
52:47 um let's say we have to do a data
52:50 strategy for a consumer
52:52 b2b2c business that's very specific with
52:54 the stakeholder
52:57 b2b2c is what is a business that sells
53:01 businesses to customers yeah correct
53:04 yeah yeah okay we have that
53:08 uh there is a stakeholder and
53:11 with what and where do you start
53:14 yeah first one is always due diligence
53:16 who is the stakeholder he or she this
53:20 person like what is their background
53:22 right because uh that's really people
53:25 forget about it's like who is the
53:26 audience of this and this person maybe
53:28 understands a ton about technology right
53:31 and you're gonna change everything in
53:33 the way you talk to this person normally
53:35 it's not right normally this is a
53:36 business person who who is doing this
53:39 uh and uh approaching this the first
53:43 thing you should do is absolutely zero
53:45 technical terms zero
53:48 and immediately you have to show you
53:51 understand what the business is doing
53:52 and this doesn't happen in a meeting
53:55 only one meeting this person has to feel
53:57 comfortable that you as a data
53:59 strategist or whatever know what the
54:01 business is doing otherwise they'll
54:02 destroy you you're not gonna hit the
54:04 target you have to be able to them to
54:06 explain what the business is about stock
54:08 selling you have to know it almost as
54:09 good as they do not really
54:12 but because they will ask you and once
54:14 you show this then they will listen
54:17 that's how humans work and when they
54:18 listen then you you have to come up with
54:21 a very specific plan again with zero
54:23 technical uh
54:26 um technical terms which is very short
54:28 one use case very fast without risk like
54:32 you can say let's we Let's do let's take
54:34 one data scientist for three months
54:36 let's do this thing let's say again a
54:38 term model uh and let's see what happens
54:41 so it's something very small and you
54:42 should be able to feel comfortable to
54:44 talking about budgets you say the salary
54:46 of this person times three months
54:48 seventy percent capacity this money I
54:51 need can you sign give them a chance to
54:53 just say yes or no you don't want them
54:54 to think about Ai and whatever
54:57 you can use the current hype of course
54:58 which helps but then give them at the
55:01 end like just one small you don't talk
55:03 about data strategy by the way no no if
55:05 you want to do a data strategy you don't
55:07 talk about data strategy because data
55:09 strategy uh sounds very static very
55:13 expensive you first Focus so let's do a
55:15 use case let's get the value first and
55:17 you do a data strategy to do the use
55:19 case
55:20 but you focus on value and concrete
55:22 results with a budget
55:26 and yeah then you can say I did the data
55:28 strategy there right and then you can
55:30 move on yeah
55:31 yeah and then we have a question about
55:33 baselines in data strategy so the
55:37 question is do we need to have two
55:39 baselines in a strategy one is for the
55:42 initial
55:43 like initial discussion initial you know
55:46 benchmarking initial understanding of
55:49 what the what's the current status and
55:50 then the second one is after
55:52 implementation and actually running the
55:54 model in production
55:56 um
55:57 I think it will be hard to come up with
56:00 uh with the exact same thing that you
56:02 try to measure I mean depends what your
56:04 your
56:05 Baseline is what normally is going to
56:07 happen is yeah you have some kind of a
56:10 business metric right reduce customer
56:13 churn right and that's very concrete you
56:15 can you can do a churn model but how do
56:17 you measure how much debt contributed
56:19 right so I don't think it's going to be
56:21 one to one and you definitely need two
56:23 because you do need to at least
56:26 qualitatively show yeah we are roughly
56:29 aligned with the
56:30 Benchmark at the beginning and we can
56:34 kind of demonstrate at least visually
56:35 right or we this quarter since the model
56:39 is deployed less people churned
56:41 right again you get the question how
56:44 does your stuff contribute but at least
56:45 you are trying to work on the same thing
56:48 I think that's the but you definitely
56:50 need something at the beginning anything
56:51 is more than a zero there right I would
56:53 say
56:55 well we should be wrapping up maybe last
56:58 question for you is
57:02 do you know of any books or other
57:04 resources that you can recommend to the
57:07 listeners who want to learn more about
57:08 uh
57:10 yeah this topic yeah so
57:13 um the the best technology book like
57:16 strategy this the book called technology
57:18 strategy patterns
57:20 which is like a gem uh which is again
57:24 super criminally underrated book I can
57:26 really recommend that one
57:27 it's focused a bit more on uh like
57:31 General stuff not just that much about
57:33 data but it's also very very concrete
57:36 uh I would say age of data Ops I
57:39 mentioned that one and in phonomics
57:43 by Doug Laney that's infonomics is great
57:45 he talks about data assets and
57:47 everything brilliant brilliant book
57:49 uh the book by Alexander boric uh and
57:53 that didn't preo that's really great
57:54 it's about it's I think it's called
57:56 digital transformation with AI I have to
57:59 get the link but that's a brilliant book
58:01 also it's very specific it goes much
58:03 deeper than I do with concrete questions
58:05 how do you what do you ask a business
58:07 person for example and the final book
58:09 which is very uh weird and that's why I
58:12 say the secrets of power and negotiating
58:15 a terrible name terrible terrible name
58:17 it's like an old 70s American style book
58:20 about how do you negotiate and convince
58:22 people but it has absolutely brilliant
58:24 advice how do you do that and a lot of
58:26 data strategy work is just just that so
58:29 read that one as well
58:31 yeah cool thanks that's a lot of books
58:34 thanks for joining us today
58:37 and uh yeah that was a lot of useful
58:41 information we will also include a link
58:43 to your book and I think we have like
58:46 five copies of your book which we are
58:48 going to give away probably when we are
58:51 going to release the audio only version
58:52 so
58:54 keep an eye on that and uh yeah have a
58:57 great weekend
