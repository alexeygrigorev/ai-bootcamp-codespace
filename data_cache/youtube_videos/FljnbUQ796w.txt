1:17 yes absolutely
1:19 okay so
1:21 this week we'll talk about becoming a
1:23 data engineering manager and we have a
1:25 special guest today rahul rahul has over
1:27 12 years of experience in data and
1:29 engineering he has been a manager for
1:32 the last two almost three years and now
1:34 he works as a data engineer manager at
1:36 siemens welcome rahul
1:39 thanks alexey
1:41 pleasure to be here
1:42 yeah thanks for for coming for joining
1:44 us so before we go into our main topic
1:46 of behind and engineering and data
1:49 engineering manager let's start with
1:51 your background can you tell us about
1:53 your career journey so far
1:56 yeah uh so first of all uh thanks
1:58 everyone for joining and thanks alexi
2:00 for inviting
2:02 uh yeah i started uh my career in
2:05 somewhere in 2010
2:07 like 12 years back and started as a
2:10 traditional etl developer and working
2:12 with the databases
2:14 and relational databases like sql server
2:17 oracle etl tools like ssis sssrs like
2:21 microstick
2:22 and then slowly moved into uh more of a
2:25 master data management kind of stuff for
2:27 enterprise
2:28 right and then somewhere in 2015 uh
2:32 started getting into cloud
2:34 and you know the volume of data was
2:36 increasing so
2:38 got some skill set dealing with uh big
2:40 data
2:41 right and
2:44 that got me into more of a data
2:45 engineering role
2:47 so transition from traditional uh etl
2:50 developer or bi developer you can call
2:52 it to more of a data engineering role
2:54 and nowadays dealing with
2:56 a lot of batch data and you know real
2:58 time streaming data building pipelines
3:01 exposing data to consumers like
3:04 to downstream systems
3:06 so yeah that's it's been a very
3:09 interesting journey in last 12 years and
3:11 currently in
3:13 since last two and a half to three years
3:15 took up uh this data engineering manager
3:18 role where i am managing a team of
3:20 enthusiast data engineers here in india
3:23 and
3:24 yeah building iot data platform for
3:28 one of the siemens businesses
3:32 that's that's pretty cool a pretty cool
3:34 journey so your journey into what we
3:37 call today data engineering started with
3:39 cloud adoption right so you saw that
3:41 many companies started to use cloud and
3:43 this is so when you turned
3:45 your transition from etl developer to a
3:48 data engineer right
3:50 do you think it's different or just the
3:52 same thing but under a different name
3:55 no it's absolutely same
3:58 i mean
3:59 basics remain same but right but you
4:02 have to acquire a new skill set but when
4:04 this data paradigm is shifting right
4:06 so a lot of things changes when the
4:08 volume and variety of data grows right
4:11 so in traditional ways days we were
4:13 dealing more likely with the structured
4:15 data which is more in relation in nature
4:18 but these days with evolution of uh you
4:20 know machines and sensors right social
4:23 media a lot of unstructured and
4:25 semi-structured data use case we are
4:27 dealing with
4:29 so before you probably use tools like
4:31 informatica talent
4:34 microsoft integration service right and
4:36 now it's uh i know kafka
4:39 spark and things like this right
4:41 yeah yeah it's more uh custom solutions
4:44 these days right which fits our needs
4:46 and moving towards more open source
4:50 frameworks right
4:52 okay yeah thanks
4:54 so let's talk about data engineering
4:56 managers so what do they do and why do
4:59 we need them
5:01 yeah so um
5:04 actually the core uh still remains same
5:07 as a people manager right so we have to
5:09 take care of your team you know you have
5:10 to
5:11 you know keep looking at you know how
5:13 your team is moving your deliverables
5:15 etc
5:16 but uh another thing which you know adds
5:18 up to this role is stakeholder
5:20 management right when you're working
5:22 with as an individual contributor you're
5:24 just
5:25 caring about your piece of work here you
5:28 have to talk to various stakeholders who
5:30 are sponsoring this data platform as
5:32 well as
5:33 who are consumers right these days the
5:36 the number of and variety of consumers
5:38 are also growing
5:39 they are the stakeholders for us right
5:41 so as a data engineering manager you
5:43 have to take care of them
5:44 their needs right
5:46 and uh again uh from the team
5:49 your team is also your stakeholder right
5:50 so you have to make sure you know their
5:53 skill set are getting upgraded
5:55 along with the
5:57 new tools and technologies coming into
5:59 play right
6:00 and then
6:01 coaching them just deciding their career
6:03 path right
6:05 and sometimes you know other things like
6:08 within a team deciding for some approach
6:11 or sometimes conflict resolutions right
6:14 and one of the most important tasks for
6:16 data hinging manager or any engineering
6:18 manager should be prioritizing the task
6:21 right you have lot of things coming on
6:23 your way right from various stakeholders
6:26 so how you
6:27 prioritize that that's one of the key
6:30 responsibilities as well
6:32 so you work on a data platform some
6:35 internal data platform right and you
6:37 manage the engineers right
6:40 and because the the setup we have to
6:43 elix is we have engineering managers
6:47 and
6:48 people who report to the engineering
6:50 managers are back-end engineers
6:52 front-end engineers and data engineers
6:55 right so
6:57 we don't have a role that is called data
6:58 engineering manager and usually there is
7:01 just an engineering manager who manages
7:03 the engineers
7:05 and i'm wondering why do we have this um
7:08 maybe because we work in so-called
7:11 feature teams like a team that works on
7:13 a specific
7:15 part of a product and everyone works on
7:17 the same thing while in your case your
7:19 team takes care of the other platform so
7:21 everyone on your team is a data engineer
7:23 right
7:24 absolutely yeah
7:26 correct yeah
7:28 and i guess it's helpful for data
7:30 engineers to have a manager who is also
7:32 a data engineer or at least who can
7:34 relate to the problems they have because
7:36 this is how they can
7:38 think what is the best way for the
7:41 development for coaching right and if we
7:44 have just a usual
7:46 engineering manager they might not
7:48 know in a lot of details about you know
7:51 new data tools and so on right that's
7:53 where you come into play into picture
7:56 and then this is you if you give
7:58 suggestions to people you tell them what
8:00 is good to learn right
8:02 yeah i think you mentioned very valid
8:04 point right um this role when i talk to
8:07 other engineering managers i realized
8:08 that as a data engineering manager you
8:11 have to
8:12 be in line with some hands-on activities
8:15 as well so you should know what your
8:16 team is working upon at the code level
8:18 sometimes right
8:20 so that's that's how i spend my time
8:22 like i wear two heads here so 50 of the
8:25 time i am working as an individual
8:26 contributor as a data engineer in my
8:28 team and remaining fifty percent i am uh
8:31 managing the team right
8:33 so
8:33 as you mentioned it uh correctly because
8:35 uh sometimes when you when you have
8:38 technical brainstorming you know or
8:40 maybe defining road maps then your
8:42 technical skill sets really comes into
8:44 play
8:45 so a data engineering manager should
8:48 should definitely you know have some
8:50 hands on not only just managing people
8:54 how do you find time to actually do this
8:56 like how large is your team how many
8:58 people do you make so currently uh
9:00 in i manage eight people so including me
9:03 it's nine people team how do you find
9:06 time
9:06 like yeah i guess if you just have one
9:08 or once with everyone on the team it's
9:10 like half week is gone already so how do
9:12 you how do you manage to find time to
9:14 actually work on hands-on activities
9:17 yeah actually it says it has been
9:19 changing so initially when we started
9:21 the team size was small i was able to do
9:23 uh adjusters to both the rolls right
9:26 now since the team size is growing right
9:28 so sometimes uh it happens
9:31 this ratio becomes like 60 40 right
9:35 but but i am fortunate enough to have a
9:37 team build around which is you know um
9:40 self-motivated and you know
9:41 self-organized kind of team and as part
9:44 of siemens culture uh
9:46 we promote servant leadership not
9:48 micromanaging a team rather enabling
9:51 them to
9:52 do their best right and and as and when
9:55 they need they can come to me or come to
9:58 any of my seniors etc my managers
10:01 so
10:02 and also when we hire we look for
10:04 someone who can you know own piece of
10:06 work right without a minimal support
10:09 from a manager or or senior senior folks
10:13 so that way uh the team is more
10:15 self-driven i would say that's how uh
10:18 i could you know find out some time for
10:21 myself on working as an individual
10:23 contributor but i know i i agree to your
10:26 point once this team size goes more
10:28 further right then it would be difficult
10:30 to perform both the rules together yeah
10:33 so basically if i understood you
10:35 correctly you have some quite
10:37 experienced people in your team who can
10:39 take care of you know helping
10:42 with technical problems and in general
10:44 the team is quite self-organized so they
10:46 most of the time do not need you right
10:48 yeah you can focus on other things
10:51 that's that's pretty that's pretty nice
10:53 to be able to have such a team when you
10:55 know that they can just work
10:57 independently and if you
10:59 need to to work on something that they
11:01 you trust them to
11:03 find a solution to whatever problem they
11:05 have that's pretty cool
11:07 yeah
11:08 yeah so how did you become a data
11:10 engineer manager how did it happen to
11:12 you oh interesting so
11:16 earlier as i mentioned when the steam
11:18 size was
11:19 less like we had
11:21 four data engineers including me
11:23 and that time
11:25 we all used to report to my manager who
11:26 is currently my manager and
11:29 and since the business started growing
11:31 right and uh the need of data platform
11:34 we pro we proved some of the use cases
11:36 that data platform can solve that so we
11:39 were we were getting more and more use
11:40 cases so naturally the team size was
11:43 increasing
11:44 and that time
11:45 my manager who is my current manager he
11:48 uh just you know called me to a
11:50 discussion one-on-one discussion and
11:52 asked if i want to take up the
11:54 engineering manager role and and my
11:57 direction was why me right we have other
11:59 folks so
12:00 so basically uh what i realized is he
12:03 mentioned couple of qualities which he
12:05 saw in me i mean i was not frankly aware
12:07 about those things
12:09 so he said the
12:11 ability to see bigger picture right what
12:13 business problem we are solving right
12:15 that you can do
12:16 along with some business acumen domain
12:18 knowledge
12:19 and situational understanding right what
12:21 is needed when
12:23 that kind of quality he saw and he asked
12:26 me this and
12:27 he mentioned that you know once you take
12:29 up this role you have to sacrifice few
12:30 things like
12:32 we all are passionate about you know
12:33 build writing code and you know building
12:35 stuff deploying that
12:36 but um
12:38 if i take up this role then i have to
12:40 sacrifice like 50 percent of the time at
12:41 least
12:42 so yeah um
12:44 that's what a natural uh evolution i was
12:46 hired as a a senior data engineer but
12:49 and immediately after six months or so
12:52 took up uh this engineering manager role
12:55 interesting so the qualities you
12:57 mentioned being able to see the bigger
12:59 picture
13:00 know
13:01 what the business problems are and you
13:04 mentioned this situational understanding
13:06 what is needed and when do you think
13:08 this is uh
13:09 so for somebody who is a senior and who
13:11 wants to become a manager is it enough
13:13 to have these things
13:15 no i think
13:16 uh i think these are
13:19 the essential ingredients but i think
13:21 one thing i forgot to mention is
13:24 about people skill right that is most
13:26 important so
13:27 in one what i would say uh empathy right
13:31 that is something um
13:33 it's more of behavioralist behavioral uh
13:36 factor right so
13:38 uh
13:39 whether you can empathize with the team
13:41 or you know people who
13:43 who you who reports to you right
13:46 that's one of the most important
13:47 ingredient
13:48 and then these things and along with
13:50 some technical skills and business
13:52 knowledge as i mentioned
13:54 so how do you think technical skills are
13:56 they
13:57 important
13:58 for this role or maybe they are less
14:00 important than empathy
14:02 seeing the bigger picture knowing the
14:04 business needs and other things
14:07 i think they're equally important with
14:08 this role because this data landscape is
14:11 changing very fast right and new and new
14:14 problem statement use cases we are
14:15 getting day by day so
14:17 i have seen in past teams and you know
14:19 and managers they are not able to cope
14:21 up with the recent technology and trends
14:23 which are needed to uplift their data
14:26 platform or data products right
14:28 that's why uh com you know in data
14:31 engineering management especially
14:33 uh technical sk you have to you know
14:35 uplift yourself always in terms of
14:37 technology stick
14:39 you may not be going into too much
14:41 details of solving individual particular
14:44 issue but at least the
14:45 high level idea the limitations and
14:48 features of particular products or
14:50 offerings right you should be available
14:54 okay so let's say for an example
14:57 now if
14:58 you use airflow right now you heard that
15:00 there is a tool called prefect which
15:02 might be nicer and then maybe you
15:04 allocate some time to give it a try and
15:07 then
15:08 see how is different from the current
15:10 technologies you use and then maybe you
15:13 also show others hey this is the tool i
15:15 played with uh let's give it a try right
15:17 or let's not give it a try because it
15:19 doesn't really work for us so doing
15:20 things like this right just trying new
15:22 tools and then
15:25 yeah yeah absolutely so along with some
15:27 senior uh data engineers or in team
15:30 right
15:30 you just brainstorm i mean what problems
15:33 this tool can solve for us right and it
15:35 has some various angles like cost
15:38 involved and you know licensing fees etc
15:41 and how easy to work so all type of
15:44 analysis you know you as a data
15:47 engineering manager you should be able
15:48 to
15:49 contribute to certain those kind of
15:51 discussions right
15:52 so
15:54 that's why i think technical uh know-how
15:56 is is is not negotiable yeah
15:59 and for you i think it's especially
16:01 important because you spend 40 to 50
16:04 percent of your time
16:06 on hands-on activities right so you
16:08 wouldn't be able to do this if you
16:09 didn't have this technical skills
16:11 absolutely that's why consciously i
16:13 chose this you know i have i have the
16:15 flexibility here in siemens to be you
16:17 know
16:18 to become a full-time people manager
16:20 right without technical without giving
16:22 much time to technical but
16:24 consciously i chose this phase so to be
16:26 you know
16:27 in line with technical trends yeah
16:32 so you had this chat with your manager
16:34 and he told you hey like you're doing
16:37 such a good job as a data engineer how
16:39 about becoming a manager
16:41 so your first reaction was why me right
16:44 but then i guess it took some time for
16:46 you to
16:48 to to think about this and agree right
16:50 and
16:51 after that what did you do next like did
16:53 you do anything to make this transition
16:55 smooth or
16:58 uh
17:00 not exactly to be to be very honest
17:02 right i didn't jot out any plan right
17:04 because the
17:06 team was growing at that point of time
17:09 and
17:10 though i got involved in
17:11 some hiring etc
17:13 but i did not have any plan at that
17:15 point of time so it was more natural
17:17 evolution
17:18 but in last you know um
17:21 two and a half to three years i have
17:23 learned uh many things which
17:25 which i was not doing initially
17:27 and and few things i have learned which
17:29 i which i could have done better you
17:31 know when i took up this role
17:33 so
17:34 at this point i would say it was more
17:35 organic you know and i learned on the
17:36 job you know and a lot of time i used to
17:39 do one-to-one with my manager to
17:41 understand you know how i should be
17:43 uh thinking you know not as an
17:45 individual contributor but as a
17:47 engineering manager right
17:49 so
17:51 yeah but i i think uh you know when i
17:54 reflect back i think
17:55 uh i could have done better planning
17:57 right like 30 days 60 or 90 days plan
18:00 something like that
18:02 and
18:02 [Music]
18:04 yeah and then it would have been much
18:06 more smoother journey but still um
18:09 uh it was quite uh
18:11 decent journey for this transition
18:14 so learning by trial and error right
18:17 yeah sometimes few things i have learned
18:19 hard way
18:20 which i could have avoided but uh it's
18:23 fine
18:24 okay yeah and
18:26 what were the main challenges for you
18:28 like in this uh in this transition
18:33 um
18:34 yeah at the beginning the first
18:36 challenges
18:37 challenge was to to get accepted in a
18:39 team right because you are one of them
18:41 one of the team member who just you know
18:43 elevated as a data engineering manager
18:46 and so building trust with the team
18:48 existing team
18:50 and
18:52 get yourself
18:53 accepted right so that was the biggest
18:55 challenge initially
18:57 and then later uh i realized i was
19:00 getting into all the stuff right like
19:03 each and every piece of work
19:05 without prioritizing them right and it
19:07 was really overwhelming
19:09 so
19:10 that thing i learned how to how you
19:12 prioritize because
19:14 uh see when you become when you're
19:16 dealing with multiple stakeholders right
19:18 people are coming from everywhere right
19:19 every um
19:21 and too much context switching you are
19:23 doing right and it's difficult to focus
19:26 on certain things so
19:28 this is this was the biggest challenge
19:29 initially and over the period of time i
19:31 you know learned reflect back and learn
19:33 again
19:34 you cannot achieve everything right
19:35 which is on your plate so you have to
19:36 prioritize the high priority items
19:39 critical items and then go with that
19:42 and
19:44 one more challenge you know initially
19:46 how
19:47 i spend a lot of thinking about it how
19:49 you uplift your team right that's one of
19:50 your uh core responsibility so currently
19:54 if my team is delivering or you know
19:56 stand at particular um
20:00 quality of of individuals next year if
20:02 i'm able to uplift them or not are they
20:04 getting better or not that was the
20:07 initial challenge
20:11 how about delegating was it difficult
20:13 for you to
20:14 um oh you said you you realize that you
20:17 cannot achieve everything you cannot do
20:19 everything yourself
20:20 and how did you realize okay like
20:24 i cannot
20:25 do this thing i need to delegate it to
20:27 somebody else how was this for you was
20:30 it difficult how did you learn to do
20:31 this
20:32 it was difficult and it is difficult to
20:35 be honest right at this point also
20:38 um because the
20:40 the culture we have here in siemens
20:41 right you do not dictate things to
20:43 people right it's more
20:45 open culture
20:46 so in this case uh
20:49 influencing right somebody to take a few
20:51 things is is really tricky but i'm still
20:53 learning that and i have learned a lot
20:56 in recent times
20:57 so and this this comes from the trust
20:59 right if you
21:01 if somebody have trust on you right and
21:03 they can you know just
21:04 take a few things which are maybe not
21:06 interesting in nature right they do not
21:07 like doing it but just to support you
21:10 they will do it
21:11 so
21:12 still that's a learning for me but yeah
21:14 that was a challenge initially
21:18 okay and
21:20 yeah you said
21:21 well if you needed to go through this
21:23 process again
21:24 you would use this you would do better
21:27 planning you mentioned this 30 60 90 day
21:31 thing
21:33 maybe can you tell us a bit more about
21:35 that and what else would you do
21:36 differently if you needed to go through
21:38 this transition again
21:41 oh yeah again when i reflect back i see
21:43 you know initially i was very um you
21:46 know
21:48 playing very safe i would say
21:50 uh that you know not questioning people
21:53 if something is not working well
21:55 just trying to build some of some trust
21:56 and i thought and not questioning people
21:58 not very assertive any in the beginning
22:01 because i didn't want to
22:03 you know
22:05 counter them you know with certain
22:06 question um
22:08 and the relationship i thought will be
22:10 good by this way right in to start with
22:13 but i think a few things where i could
22:16 have you know
22:17 be more assertive with the team
22:20 and with some of the stakeholders right
22:22 um
22:24 on some non-negotiable items that's
22:26 something which i would do
22:28 if i get a chance again to relive those
22:30 moments
22:31 and i think uh the another thing which
22:34 which i should have done in the very
22:36 beginning is
22:37 setting out clear expectation with the
22:39 team right so defining core goals and
22:42 you know objectives etc
22:44 and how together as a team will achieve
22:46 our individual right
22:48 they will achieve so that part i started
22:50 little late but i think i should have
22:52 done uh much earlier
22:55 yeah
22:56 how to do this how to how do you set
22:59 clear expectations of atm so let's say
23:01 you have a team
23:02 that works on a data platform for iot
23:05 right in your case so how do you set
23:07 expectations how do you understand what
23:09 uh i don't know team purpose or these
23:12 things right
23:13 yeah
23:15 yeah it took quite some time to you know
23:17 build that framework right to set this
23:20 because see
23:21 the nature of business is you know
23:23 changing very dynamically right and
23:26 you
23:28 you will have
23:29 requirement changing uh very often right
23:32 then what uh
23:34 i did and we did as a as an organization
23:36 and as a team i did is
23:39 defining goals in two categories one is
23:42 like we are committed objectives or
23:44 goals or another category is
23:46 aspirational goals right
23:48 so committed objective we put uh certain
23:51 things that you know you should not be
23:52 missing delivery timelines no spillover
23:55 in the next sprint code quality should
23:57 be good no defect all those things which
23:59 are expected out of a software engineer
24:01 or data engineer
24:02 those are committed goals which are
24:04 non-negotiable right that you have to
24:06 achieve right and we have certain
24:08 matrixes to track those
24:10 and to uplift the team right because see
24:13 with the mature team all committed goals
24:15 are
24:16 you know more or less met always right
24:18 but the challenge come where you want to
24:21 you know uplift the game so those kind
24:24 of goals like how you modernize your
24:26 data platform right
24:27 or how you challenge the status quo of
24:30 the processes which we were following so
24:32 those goals i have put it in as part of
24:34 aspirational targets or inspirational
24:36 goals
24:37 and those aspirational goals should be
24:40 uh big enough that you should not be
24:42 able to achieve 100 right that that's
24:45 what comes
24:46 we call it aspirational goal if you
24:48 achieve 50 70
24:50 that then you're you know you're good to
24:52 go
24:53 so that way we are trying to
24:58 build the framework for you know
24:59 expectation management and performance
25:01 management
25:03 yeah thanks and we have a related
25:05 question from lock
25:06 uh the question is what are the the
25:08 success measures of data engineering
25:13 okay as a team
25:17 as a team i would say um
25:21 success measure is how how
25:24 you enable or cultivate the data culture
25:26 within the organization right
25:28 or within the stake
25:31 among the stakeholders who are
25:32 interacting with you right
25:34 and the decisions which
25:37 before the data came into picture if
25:39 somebody was taking on
25:41 based on the judgmental call or gut
25:42 feelings right those should be more data
25:44 driven in nature
25:46 so
25:47 that's
25:49 that's the you know
25:51 i think
25:52 not tangible thing but it's a cultural
25:54 thing tangible i would say if you know
25:57 we are able to serve more and more use
25:59 cases in terms of uh for our consumer
26:02 data consumers
26:04 and
26:05 easy and by removing some of the
26:08 frictions right
26:09 and how easy we can expose our data to
26:11 various stakeholders in different
26:13 formats it could be
26:14 like reporting visualization
26:17 some
26:18 restful apis for applications right or
26:21 for some
26:23 some data for machine learning or data
26:24 science community within the
26:25 organization
26:27 so
26:28 the variety of use cases you are able to
26:30 support
26:32 with use of data platform
26:34 i think
26:35 that's one of the
26:36 kpi
26:38 for the success
26:40 yeah interesting
26:42 and
26:43 yeah i guess are there any other formal
26:47 metrics because i usually don't see
26:49 objectives right so and then you
26:51 probably look at objectives if you are
26:53 to understand if the team is moving at
26:55 right directions so apart from that
26:57 maybe there is no
26:59 need to have other formal metrics and
27:02 kpis for you right we capture some of
27:04 the metrics like uh
27:06 i mean data quality matrices like we
27:08 capture right and uh
27:10 data reconciliation framework we have
27:12 right and
27:14 we kept in terms of percentage right for
27:16 different
27:19 line of businesses of data
27:20 and uh
27:22 um along with that some some basic um
27:26 percentage coverage of
27:28 uh our source system data what we have
27:30 to offer
27:32 and how we are enriching the data so how
27:35 we uplifted the quality of the data
27:38 right using some smart ways of you know
27:41 including third party data etc
27:43 so i know i mean it's very difficult to
27:46 measure right the success of data
27:47 platform because it sits at the back and
27:49 right there is some there is a certain
27:51 limits you can as a matrix you can put
27:53 right
27:55 but i think uh
27:57 one of the key metrics is how many
27:58 consumers you're serving you know
28:00 they're interested in your data
28:04 yeah that's a good one what is the
28:05 theory conciliation
28:08 uh it's basically um
28:10 [Music]
28:11 the you you're pulling data from various
28:12 source systems loading into your data
28:14 warehouse or data lake right
28:16 in between there is a etl layers or elt
28:19 layer involved right so what we do once
28:21 our data load is done in batch mode or
28:23 real-time mode we reconcile with what we
28:25 had in the source system was this target
28:27 right
28:28 are we losing any data in between or not
28:31 so
28:32 that kind of framework we have built
28:34 here
28:35 yeah you are not supposed to lose any
28:37 data right so it should be absolutely
28:38 yes
28:40 yeah
28:41 why can we lose something because of
28:43 downtime right
28:46 because of downtime because of you know
28:48 your leakages in your etl pipeline right
28:51 you are filtering some data let's say or
28:54 not putting proper exceptional handling
28:56 sometimes that's how you lose the data
29:00 yeah and
29:01 there's a question related i think to
29:03 data platform
29:06 so data engineering is moving towards
29:08 full automation with data versioning
29:11 and to manage model serving how do you
29:13 solve the gdpar compliance issues and
29:15 bring stakeholders on board that's quite
29:19 maybe not an easy question right
29:22 uh yeah i mean what about this at all
29:24 like gdpr in your case for iot
29:27 absolutely so
29:29 we do not have those many um gdpr
29:32 related compliances in terms of you know
29:34 our business is b2b right it's not uh
29:37 related to end customer but still we
29:39 cater to certain data sets which are
29:41 which have to be gdpr compliant right
29:43 so
29:45 we put it uh
29:47 the data platform we have chosen for uh
29:50 the basically the data warehouse tool we
29:52 have chosen is cloud based and
29:55 where we do a lot of dynamic data
29:57 masking
29:58 and
30:00 which is which is a lot different than
30:01 the state static data masking in
30:03 traditional days right so and we have
30:05 role based access control put it on top
30:07 of it so certain people only can see
30:09 certain kind of data right so we have
30:12 tagged the data classified our data in
30:14 terms of uh
30:16 highly classified and you know public
30:18 data sets and then put it
30:21 dynamic data masking and role-based
30:23 access control on top of it
30:25 so only relevant people can access
30:28 authorized people can access the
30:30 data which they're supposed to
30:32 and dynamic data masking is when you see
30:34 some personal data or some restricted
30:36 data then it is replaced with something
30:39 else right so let's say instead of email
30:42 you see
30:43 uh a hash or something right yeah hash
30:45 or cross or you know asterisk sign etc
30:48 yeah yeah nice thanks
30:51 um another question from nishikant is
30:54 how do you handle
30:55 data modeling for big data
30:58 like do you
31:00 do a agile or something like this to
31:02 handle evolving requirements
31:06 yeah initially we had quite a lot of
31:07 challenge with this right
31:09 because we have defined certain data
31:11 model
31:12 and the variety of use cases
31:15 started increasing
31:17 and earlier we were following typical
31:19 etl methodology right where we extract
31:21 the data transform and load into a
31:23 target data model
31:25 but and that was very tightly coupled
31:27 you know the data model was very fixed
31:29 in nature right
31:31 and that's how we realize we cannot live
31:33 with that it's not scalable and flexible
31:36 and we changed our approach to uh from
31:39 etl to elt so basically pulling the data
31:42 loading into our data warehouse and then
31:45 transforming it on the go so that's our
31:47 data model became more resilient right
31:50 and flexible in nature
31:52 and with less dependency on different uh
31:56 data marts or table side
31:58 and i think that and that's how and also
32:02 uh we have implemented data lake also
32:04 for in our data platform
32:06 and which is more robust in nature
32:08 compared to data warehouse
32:11 so if something changes then it means
32:12 that maybe you will need to go back
32:16 to i don't know previous year and
32:18 recompute some things if you do a change
32:20 in schema right because you keep the raw
32:22 data in your data lake and then if you
32:24 do some changes in your data model then
32:26 you just go and recompute it
32:29 yes so we do not change data models so
32:31 often right rather you know
32:34 we have flat data model in place so we
32:36 serve the
32:38 consumers and perform all these
32:40 aggregation at the real time most of the
32:42 in most of the use cases but certain
32:44 piece of data which is um kind of master
32:46 data is more
32:48 uh you know structured in nature and
32:50 there we have uh you know very
32:52 traditional data models
32:54 so basically we are in order to handle
32:57 uh big data right we are we are dealing
32:59 with the combination of a data model
33:01 traditional data model flat data model
33:03 as well as the data lake
33:06 and what if the raw data changes
33:08 then
33:09 i guess you will need to somehow think
33:11 how exactly you can read the old raw
33:13 data and the neural data right
33:16 yeah so data lineage we are maintaining
33:18 here right so
33:20 um and a lot of time the
33:23 old data we put in cash which are most
33:25 frequently used right in our warehouse
33:27 and
33:28 when the new data comes we recalculate
33:30 that i mean invalidate and you know
33:32 reactivate the cash to serve
33:35 faster to the customers
33:39 yeah okay back to our topic of
33:43 the data engineering management
33:45 because there are still a few things i
33:46 wanted to
33:47 [Music]
33:48 ask you
33:50 what would you suggest to somebody who
33:51 is transitioning right now into a data
33:55 management into engineering management
33:57 role and specifically to data
33:58 engineering management role
34:02 yeah i think um
34:04 a few things you have to accept and you
34:06 know from the day one is uh
34:09 you cannot
34:11 you know continue playing the individual
34:14 contributor role because you have
34:15 limited time right
34:17 this is what i have seen
34:19 some of the mistakes people make more
34:21 often is they
34:23 still you know
34:25 are very much fascinated about the
34:27 coding part of it
34:28 but you have to just uh you know uplift
34:31 yourself and just see a bigger picture
34:34 you know from
34:35 uh
34:36 fro for whole business point of view
34:38 what problem you're solving right
34:40 and
34:42 and the second thing is empathy right if
34:43 you're genuinely interested in the
34:45 growth of your team members right and
34:49 that shows right and that is clearly
34:51 visible
34:52 so
34:53 each and every team members you should
34:55 have you have to have certain career
34:57 planning right sitting with them
34:59 uh knowing their aspirations right
35:02 excuse me
35:03 and build some credit planning and
35:04 enable them you know to achieve those um
35:08 skills or you know those goals which
35:09 they aim for
35:11 so just to summarize i would say um
35:15 let go few technical uh things right
35:18 going much deeper into all the technical
35:20 aspects and then empathize with the team
35:22 members
35:24 and also you have to you know be on top
35:27 of the game right you have to know what
35:28 the latest trends are going and that's
35:30 how you can enable your team to
35:32 think in certain direction right or
35:34 expose
35:35 this new area of work to them
35:38 yeah that was the question i wanted to
35:40 ask you how exactly you enable team
35:42 members so one thing is be on top of
35:44 latest trends
35:46 how do you actually do this how do you
35:47 stay on top of trends because
35:49 like in data engineering well i'm a data
35:51 scientist and in data science there are
35:53 so many things happening it's just
35:55 simply impossible to stand off in data
35:57 engineering i think is also like it's an
35:59 actively
36:01 developing area
36:02 new tools appear new ways of doing stuff
36:05 up here how do you manage to stay on top
36:07 of that
36:08 so when i say standard it's not
36:10 necessarily mean that you always change
36:12 your platform's tools and techniques
36:14 right because
36:15 that's not something you you need
36:16 certain kind of yeah it's still
36:18 stability you need right so when i say
36:20 uh reinventing yourself is uh and
36:23 getting better at what you did so let
36:25 for example let's say
36:26 when you when somebody knew uh data
36:29 engineer joined my team and it took
36:31 like two weeks or three weeks to develop
36:33 a data pipeline right test it deployed
36:36 into production
36:37 next time if if the same pipeline comes
36:39 or similar kind of work comes right it
36:42 should take a little less than that
36:44 that's how you grow and second thing is
36:47 uh
36:49 we have come
36:50 a certain way right in last two to three
36:52 years without the maturity of data
36:54 platform right
36:55 what all things right which we can make
36:57 more modular
36:59 right and
37:00 some of the things which we can automate
37:02 we have to constantly think about those
37:04 lines and team members are not doing uh
37:07 monotonous work
37:08 right that should be
37:10 the benchmark
37:11 when the when you challenge that
37:12 monotonous work obviously you will
37:15 try to figure out new ways
37:17 or smart ways of doing the same work
37:20 that's how indirectly your team will be
37:22 uh you know challenging a status quo
37:24 always
37:25 okay so it's not about staying up to
37:28 date with i don't know state of the art
37:30 and knowing all the recent technologies
37:32 it's more about knowing what's happening
37:35 in the team and how we can make their
37:37 lives easier and
37:40 the work more interesting right
37:42 yeah
37:43 other way around it sometimes a
37:44 challenge right how you keep restricts
37:47 or maybe put some restrictions because
37:49 you know people are very passionate
37:51 about okay i want to implement this or
37:53 you know the new tool in the market or
37:54 automation right build versus buy all
37:56 those things
37:57 but you have to just sit you know
38:00 calm your team and you know just focus
38:02 on the end goal right what we are trying
38:04 to achieve not get fascinated with the
38:06 technology or new tool sets or sas
38:09 offerings each day or you know
38:11 continuously
38:12 yeah that's very easy to do because you
38:15 hear all this uh
38:18 you know you see all these tools appear
38:20 people in twitter talk about this and
38:21 other social media and it feels like
38:24 okay this is the tool i need to stop
38:26 doing everything and try this but this
38:29 tool is not actually solving your
38:30 business problem right and then you need
38:32 to know about this
38:34 okay
38:35 and
38:36 what in your opinion are the qualities
38:40 of and skills that a team a data team
38:43 people in the data team should know
38:44 because you manage a team right as a
38:47 manager
38:49 so what qualities the team should have
38:54 yeah i think first of all i start with
38:57 understanding the problem statement
38:59 right
39:00 or the business problem sometimes and
39:02 sometimes there is no problem what you
39:04 know use using the power of data you can
39:07 you know
39:08 solve certain use cases right
39:11 so first the team should be mature or
39:13 you know think from that direction
39:15 and then comes the technology part into
39:17 it
39:18 right so basic if i talk about taking
39:20 text stack right so
39:22 i always go to very basics like you
39:23 should as a data engineer you should
39:24 know sql right etl concept data
39:28 warehousing concepts right and then um
39:31 you know at least one scripting language
39:32 like uh python or spark right
39:35 um
39:37 and and typical ci cd framework etc so
39:40 these things and and cloud these days
39:42 right
39:43 so these are the basics which which are
39:45 important you know
39:47 uh which are non negotiable i would say
39:50 uh in current situations
39:53 um
39:54 and
39:55 yeah ownership is something uh which i
39:57 think is most important
39:59 um peace
40:02 yeah what is ownership
40:04 ownership is uh
40:06 see uh
40:09 basically if
40:10 a certain decision you're taking right
40:12 and if something goes wrong
40:14 or maybe something fails that
40:17 you own that and
40:19 you do not
40:20 go into certain blame games or you know
40:24 you just try to fix it first and then
40:26 we see what happens
40:29 without interfering without getting
40:30 asked from managers or senior people or
40:33 stakeholders right okay like if
40:35 something breaks you don't wait
40:37 till your manager comes and says
40:40 hey
40:41 why this pipeline is not working right
40:44 yeah absolutely so
40:46 so initially i used to get a lot of
40:47 alerts right when something fails but
40:49 then i just delegated that work that if
40:52 and we decided the ownership of certain
40:53 pieces where i would not be receiving
40:55 the alert i trust the team they take
40:57 care of these things right
40:59 okay so technology-wise you set the
41:02 non-negotiation negotiable minimum in
41:05 sql knowing what etl is knowing data
41:07 every house one scripting language like
41:10 python knowing the concept of the icd
41:12 and
41:13 uh oh knowing a cloud platform
41:16 that's technology
41:18 and
41:19 then also like this business acumen uh
41:22 knowing uh the problems and this so
41:24 these are the qualities
41:26 that people in the data engineering team
41:28 data engineers should have right
41:30 yeah ownership right here we also
41:32 mentioned partnership yeah yeah
41:34 and
41:36 as a manager you probably take a lot of
41:39 time in hiring people so i guess the
41:42 things you
41:43 are looking in candidates right you you
41:46 ask them you use you want to see these
41:48 qualities in the candidates right
41:51 absolutely plus one more thing i would
41:53 say when it when it comes to hiring
41:54 right uh especially with this remote
41:56 work environment right this something
41:59 called uh communication skill right it
42:01 becomes very important
42:02 how you communicate how proactive you
42:04 are right
42:05 um
42:07 and uh one thing i look for you know
42:10 very first question sometimes i ask to
42:12 the candidate is
42:13 just tell me in explain in five minutes
42:15 right one of your best project you
42:18 implemented or your your part of
42:20 so
42:21 i would say um how a candidate
42:24 articulate things right and very uh and
42:27 stay to
42:28 very precise answer in what question has
42:31 been asked just stick to the answer for
42:33 it
42:34 so that's something uh uh i mean it was
42:36 important before uh this pandemic but
42:40 it's i mean nowadays it's it became more
42:42 important
42:44 so explain in your project in five
42:46 minutes so in this five minute part i
42:49 guess it's
42:50 also quite important right because i
42:52 imagine if somebody asks me about a
42:54 project i am proud of
42:56 then
42:57 yeah maybe they will need to stop me at
42:59 some point because they can just go
43:01 on and on and on right so here you have
43:03 to be concise right you have to be
43:05 concise and you know just think of uh if
43:08 you are explaining these things up to
43:10 maybe non-data or non-id people right
43:13 so how would you uh explain this
43:16 not going to too much technical details
43:18 but
43:19 first start with a
43:21 business use case and what you or your
43:23 team did to you know solve it
43:27 that's why i keep this limit of five
43:29 minutes you know just to you know finish
43:31 it in five if if i have any further
43:33 questions if i'm interested or to know
43:35 something more and dig deeper into it
43:37 then
43:38 then following questions uh you know
43:40 takes place
43:42 so start with uh when talking about a
43:45 project
43:46 you should start with a business problem
43:47 so you do not jump into
43:50 i don't know i was using spark to move
43:52 one terabyte of data uh in parking from
43:55 s3 to i don't know google cloud storage
43:57 right nobody can absolutely
43:59 absolutely business problem
44:02 that's a that's a
44:04 common mistake i would say people do
44:06 that they start directly jump into a
44:08 technology part of it i mean that's not
44:10 the i mean
44:11 something they're passionate about but
44:13 right
44:14 but still
44:15 yeah
44:17 but still you have to be able to
44:18 articulate these things in in you know
44:21 lesser time
44:23 yeah because this is a mistake i also do
44:25 quite often like because i'm so proud of
44:27 what i built and i want to talk about
44:29 this and then i forget about that
44:32 actually i was not doing this for the
44:33 sake of doing this right that there was
44:36 some problem that i was trying to solve
44:38 and uh
44:39 yeah that's important to
44:41 to bring this up and to what else do you
44:44 ask on the interview
44:47 uh see generally
44:49 initially i do
44:50 part of technical
44:52 screening as well but these days focus
44:54 is more on hiring manager round
44:56 so somebody from my team or you know
44:58 peer teams they take
45:00 technical discussions right and if that
45:03 goes through then in the hiring manager
45:05 round i mostly focus on
45:07 as i mentioned uh about the project and
45:09 second thing is
45:11 um
45:11 just try to gauge uh
45:14 you know what a candidate not focusing
45:16 on the past what they have done in the
45:18 past but
45:19 what they can do in the future for your
45:22 team or your organization right
45:24 that we have to i mean it's difficult
45:26 but you know asking certain incidents
45:28 and how they will react and sometimes i
45:30 put them into certain situations with
45:32 which are more hypothetical situations
45:35 right
45:36 and how
45:37 they respond to that so for example
45:40 um you know
45:42 for example if you want to
45:45 launch amazon.com in in antarctica right
45:48 or launch uber in china right so
45:52 that that gives me the thought process
45:54 it's not related to directly data
45:56 engineering concepts but how a person
45:58 thinks about a problem and
46:01 and the answer may not be i mean not 100
46:04 right obviously right it's just approach
46:06 which i try to age
46:08 and
46:09 along with that certain um you know
46:12 leadership qualities like uh
46:14 customer opposition right
46:16 and tell some incident about
46:20 which explain their customer opposition
46:22 and
46:23 you know um
46:24 their ownership as i mentioned right so
46:27 discussion along these lines
46:30 so what's the right answer to how you
46:32 open amazon in america
46:35 i don't know i don't know the right
46:37 answer right because if if amazon let's
46:39 say hires me and you know ask me to do
46:41 it i may not be right person for doing
46:44 it
46:44 but i think this starts with um
46:48 you know um
46:50 it i mean there could be many right
46:52 answers to it right it's just
46:54 approaching amazon for example in
46:56 antarctica
46:58 sorry also maybe the right answer is you
47:00 don't open it there like you could also
47:03 no no that's the
47:05 that's the prerequisite that you have to
47:06 you have to
47:08 you cannot bypass that
47:11 okay
47:13 can you tell us about your best hire
47:17 um
47:19 yeah i think
47:22 i think couple of them in recent times
47:24 right uh
47:25 so similar qualities they have shown
47:27 right when when we've gone through so as
47:30 i mentioned these are technical skill
47:31 set plus the hiring manager uh
47:33 behavioral skills which i uh try to
47:36 judge people on um
47:38 that's something and anna when you talk
47:41 about best highlights something has to
47:42 be different than the other hires right
47:45 so i recall you know like six months
47:47 back uh one higher and then eighth month
47:51 before two months that
47:52 so those
47:53 both of those guys you know they um they
47:57 adhered to all these qualities which we
47:58 were trying to judge
48:00 but on top of it you know they were very
48:02 keen on understanding uh
48:04 our use cases what we are trying to
48:06 achieve and the job fitment basically so
48:09 in in short term and midterm you know
48:12 what do we ex i expect as a
48:14 uh engineering manager with those guys
48:16 so they were trying to gauge that
48:19 not just applying for a random job and
48:21 you know
48:22 just appearing for interview they did a
48:23 lot of due diligence about the company
48:27 and uh about the team they reached
48:30 reached out to other team members over
48:31 linkedin saw their profiles where they
48:33 come from all these due diligence they
48:35 did and once the interview round was
48:38 finished we were about to go to hr
48:40 discussion
48:41 you know both of them separately right
48:44 they asked to have one more discussion
48:46 with me where they
48:48 they kind of interviewed me you know
48:51 about um you know obviously their career
48:54 path what and what's the next role they
48:56 should be aspire for in the organization
48:58 right and talking a lot about culture
49:00 so that gives sometimes um
49:04 that shows the genuinity right uh
49:06 whether you want to work for
49:07 organization or not
49:09 so i would say due diligence is
49:10 something and and
49:12 assertiveness was you know which
49:15 sets uh you know best higher part with
49:17 the other highers
49:19 and what i heard from all this is if you
49:22 want to impress a hiring manager ask the
49:24 recruiters to schedule one more
49:26 interview
49:27 oh my god you
49:29 you just exposed this
49:30 [Laughter]
49:35 there is a quite related question from
49:36 frederick
49:37 so the question is about hiring the
49:39 engineers
49:40 and
49:42 i also saw this that we often get
49:44 candidates who just put a lot of
49:47 buzzwords in their uh cvs like big data
49:50 security scalable
49:52 um you know then you add a bunch of
49:54 technologies like spark flink uh
49:56 what else is there like pulsar kafka
49:58 like you just put a lot of buzzwords
50:00 there
50:01 and yeah of course i imagine that these
50:03 people pass the
50:05 the first recruiter filter right so
50:07 because like all the keywords match
50:10 um but then at the end maybe apart from
50:12 buzzwords they uh
50:14 there is no um
50:16 like real knowledge so how how do you
50:18 solve this as a data engineering manager
50:21 before the interview is there a way to
50:22 somehow spot this uh
50:25 this
50:26 these candidates
50:29 uh before the interview it's a little
50:30 difficult right because in the screening
50:32 you just have a profile or resume in
50:34 front of you right
50:36 there
50:37 i think nobody you know reads whole
50:39 resume because we don't have that much
50:40 time right you just glance on few things
50:43 that's it
50:44 um
50:45 but i think uh
50:47 during the hr discussion so what we did
50:49 recently is you know passed on certain
50:51 questions to
50:52 hr to just get idea of it
50:55 but if some if let's say candidate goes
50:57 through it then again
51:00 somehow most of the time i capture this
51:02 during the
51:05 hiring manager around most of the time
51:07 because these guys sometimes tend to
51:08 clear the technical rounds as well
51:11 but
51:12 but we had uh you know internal uh
51:15 discussions with mind technical
51:16 interview panels that how you spot these
51:19 things right
51:20 so we instead of directly jumping into
51:23 uh
51:24 raw technical questions we
51:26 uh start with you know if if we find
51:28 certain things which is not adding up
51:30 like certain technology or framework
51:32 which they claim they worked upon then
51:34 we asked them to uh
51:36 give us the scenario you know why they
51:38 use this technology or when they in
51:40 which scenario they use this this kind
51:42 of technology and there you can just
51:44 classify simply if this guy has done
51:46 just
51:48 mentioned this for the sake of
51:49 mentioning or worked with it so asking
51:51 very basic questions like
51:53 for example somebody claims that i
51:56 worked on data lake and data warehouse
51:57 so you just ask what is the difference
51:59 between data lake and data warehouse
52:00 right
52:01 or
52:02 on-premise and crowd these very basic
52:05 questions right if they're able to
52:06 articulate or you know mention this then
52:09 um then fine
52:12 otherwise you can spot
52:14 these things
52:16 to basically ask about the context which
52:18 this technology was used if somebody
52:20 says they used uh you know kafka then
52:22 ask why kafka wow what was that you were
52:25 saying and what what were the
52:27 alternatives and why you decided to use
52:29 this particular technology versus
52:32 alternatives right
52:33 absolutely yeah the context is very
52:36 important
52:38 i remember i was also doing cv screening
52:41 and i saw a person mentioned all these
52:44 bash tools like oak said pearl and all
52:47 that you know
52:48 and i was on one hand i really wanted to
52:50 ask that person like hey do you really
52:53 know all that
52:54 and then on the dab on the other hand is
52:56 because i don't know this myself and
52:58 people who know this thing they uh to me
53:00 like uh
53:02 i don't know they really impressed me so
53:04 i wasn't i wasn't sure if they just put
53:06 this for the sake of putting this
53:08 like let's say if you don't know a
53:10 technology but you see somebody put this
53:13 and you know that this is a
53:15 difficult like it's a complex technology
53:17 how do you
53:18 assess if they actually know what they
53:20 are talking about
53:22 yeah that's difficult
53:25 so
53:27 so what i do is uh it happens sometimes
53:30 it's not very often but it happens so
53:32 what i do is
53:34 during the interview i just open up
53:36 that particular uh
53:38 the technology or tool right which they
53:40 mentioned just search on the google
53:42 right a simple search which opens uh
53:44 that company website or wikipedia and
53:46 that gives what this tool is all about
53:48 right in like two lines right
53:51 and then
53:52 i mean and it comes with experience also
53:54 right if you do it again and again that
53:56 that you build the habit of
53:58 understanding a new technology not
54:00 understand the technology but
54:01 understanding the concept of that
54:03 technology why that exists
54:05 so yeah at the same time i you know just
54:07 open a browser and you know just
54:10 while candidates explaining you know i
54:12 get certain questions around
54:14 you know those technologies yeah
54:17 yeah well maybe they can also do that
54:19 right open wikipedia page
54:23 yeah you can just
54:26 yeah but you can just read few things
54:27 from from there right but the question
54:29 would not be directly from that
54:31 wikipedia page or the website
54:35 um there's the question from crucial is
54:38 uh
54:39 so i think they are a second year
54:42 student
54:43 and the question is how can what we can
54:46 do what would you suggest to ace in
54:49 being a data engineer
54:52 yeah for you know
54:54 recent college graduate or students
54:56 right i would say
54:59 focus on basics here right do not jump
55:02 into any specific tools or technology
55:04 sometimes it happens it hap it happened
55:05 with me as well when i was starting my
55:07 id journey right uh that time uh i think
55:11 informatica and these these tools were
55:13 very famous in the market
55:15 uh so don't focus on particular tools
55:18 and technology rather in your college
55:20 days focus on basics like
55:23 how database management system works
55:25 right and
55:28 like basics of sql and
55:31 some python maybe right just try to
55:34 understand how software engineering
55:35 works at that point of time
55:37 and
55:39 just get to know basic terms of
55:41 what is data warehouse what is etl
55:44 before to getting too much attached to
55:46 any enterprise tools all right
55:50 so let's build the
55:51 build the basics first
55:53 and then later jump into what industry
55:55 demands
55:57 because i guess if we talk about a four
55:58 year program and you're currently in a
56:01 second year program maybe by the time
56:03 you graduate the tools that are popular
56:05 right now will not be popular anymore
56:07 right and uh absolutely
56:09 like informatica was very popular but
56:11 now how many people use it i i think
56:13 still they have a like a large uh piece
56:17 of the cake right so of the market share
56:19 but still i don't think it's as big
56:21 spread as it used to be right so maybe
56:23 it's yeah better to invest your time in
56:26 learning something that is more commonly
56:28 used but how do you know what would be
56:30 only used in two years you don't right
56:32 you don't
56:33 so you have to be see um
56:35 that's the shift i'm seeing these days
56:37 right with the great candidate versus
56:39 average candidate you hire right
56:42 person who is able to reinvent
56:44 themselves right again and again right
56:46 and
56:47 and you know just get better again and
56:49 again that that is something which you
56:52 uh
56:53 which sets apart you know with other
56:54 average candidates who are more focused
56:56 on understanding any technology or tools
56:58 right
56:59 so
57:00 excuse me
57:02 just if your basics are right right and
57:04 these t4 uh
57:07 technologies you know
57:08 right querying in python etc
57:10 then you should be good learning any new
57:12 tool in the market and these days these
57:14 tools are very
57:15 user friendly i would say or developer
57:17 friendly right
57:18 um a lot of good ui they are putting
57:21 into place and very easy to use so it's
57:23 a matter of few days or weeks to learn a
57:26 new tool
57:27 yeah
57:28 yeah there is one question uh probably
57:31 last one because i see we should be
57:32 wrapping up
57:33 but this question has seven upwards so i
57:35 think i have to ask it so question from
57:38 akshay is i want to know real world
57:40 end-to-end process of how a data
57:42 engineering team design build deploy and
57:44 monitor with structured
57:47 data in both real and batch i think this
57:49 is too much for one minute that we have
57:51 left
57:52 maybe you can give us okay an overview
57:56 i think i think we should have another
57:57 session you know dedicated to this piece
57:59 right
58:00 which which can you know last couple of
58:02 hours right
58:04 but anyways you know just to summarize
58:06 this you know in in the matter of time
58:08 is um
58:09 so there are different pieces of data
58:12 engineering right end to end so
58:13 first
58:14 if you start with the source systems
58:16 where data exists right it could be
58:18 relational database flat files cloud s3
58:20 all these things and you build one data
58:22 pipeline to pull data from source
58:24 systems and load into your data
58:26 warehouse or data lake that is your
58:28 centralized data hub and then you build
58:30 one process to expose this data because
58:33 this is one first part of it you have
58:34 all the retain data warehouse
58:36 but how a consumer who is interested in
58:38 your data will consume it so there could
58:40 be various methods of con consuming the
58:43 data in terms of you have let's say
58:45 reporting tool or visualization tool
58:48 and you have certain apis built on on
58:50 top of your data warehouse platforms
58:52 which can serve any applications in real
58:54 time
58:55 you can have some another etl layer for
58:58 you know um some other consumers who are
59:00 interested in your data so
59:02 this this whole end-to-end system can be
59:05 in batch mode also which runs daily or
59:07 weekly load and second thing is it can
59:09 be event based also so the moment data
59:12 arrive in your source system you can
59:14 have certain events listening to that
59:16 source system for example let's say s3
59:18 bucket right your file length on s3
59:19 bucket
59:20 your lambda function get triggered i am
59:22 talking in terms of aws terminologies
59:25 and that puts your reads data from s3
59:27 buckets and load into your data
59:29 warehouse so that is more real time
59:31 or if you talk about streaming then you
59:33 have kafka or any message brokers which
59:36 you know can connect to real-time data
59:38 with your warehouse right so i would say
59:41 just to summarize this focus not only
59:44 just bringing data into data warehouse
59:45 but a second part which is how you
59:48 expose that data if nobody is able to
59:51 consumer data consume your data then
59:53 your data warehouse is not uh worthy or
59:55 useful at all right
59:58 yeah thanks a lot um
1:00:01 what's the best way to find you if
1:00:03 somebody has questions is it linkedin or
1:00:06 there are other ways
