0:58 correctly yeah yeah okay
1:00 I should have checked it before okay no
1:03 worries this week we'll talk about um
1:06 being research scientist at Amazon and
1:09 transitioning from being research
1:10 scientist to doing freelancing and
1:13 Consulting and we have a special guest
1:15 today Vera B has strong expertise in NLP
1:18 and machine learning with more than
1:20 seven years of experience her background
1:22 is in statistics and she recently quit
1:25 her job as a research scientist at
1:27 Amazon to work as a freelancer and today
1:30 we will talk about that so
1:32 welcome to our interview thanks Alex
1:36 glad to be
1:37 here thanks so the questions for today's
1:40 interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer
1:42 thanks Johanna for your help and yeah
1:45 let's start so before we go into our
1:48 main topic of being research scientist
1:51 and transitioning into freelance um
1:53 freelancer in machine learning let's
1:55 start with your background can you tell
1:57 us about your career Journey so far
2:00 sure um yeah
2:03 well it was really pretty much like a
2:05 step bystep thing um so I originally
2:09 studied economics uh because I always
2:12 liked learning languages and I didn't
2:15 but I didn't kind of see a career path
2:17 if I just studied a language so I
2:19 decided to do a economics study uh in
2:22 combination with Chinese
2:25 studies so we also spent some time in
2:28 China which was pretty interesting and
2:31 but after some time I kind of found out
2:33 that I didn't really like economics that
2:35 much I found it was a
2:37 bit Yeah arbitrary in the sense that you
2:40 have some assumptions in one model but
2:43 then you and you arrive at a result but
2:46 if you change the assumptions then you
2:48 arrive at a different result and I think
2:50 in economics it's kind of hard to verify
2:53 your assumptions and I found that more
2:56 straightforward in statistics so
2:58 basically in the economic
3:00 Bachelor you also have a lot of
3:01 statistics and there was a possibility
3:05 to focus on statistics more which I then
3:07 did and also went yeah econometrics time
3:11 series all those kind of things and then
3:13 also did my um Bachelor thesis in
3:16 statistics and went on to did the master
3:19 in in
3:20 statistics um yeah and back at the time
3:23 I mean data science was not that much of
3:25 a hype yet so I was really doing a lot
3:27 of classical statistics but I did have
3:29 some machine learning and data science
3:31 courses during my master and really like
3:34 that a lot better uh than the
3:36 traditional statistics so you stud in
3:38 Berlin I I did the master in Berlin yeah
3:41 yeah this is Joint statistics program
3:45 from the Free University um humbold
3:49 university and the Technical University
3:52 they have this joint master
3:54 program and yeah basically discovered
3:58 data science in machine learning during
4:00 that program and decided okay uh this is
4:03 what I want to work on and yeah I was
4:05 trying to find a job uh in Berlin in
4:08 data science after after finishing the
4:10 master but in 2017 there was almost no
4:14 data science positions in in Berlin like
4:17 also cando at the time was not hiring
4:20 data scientists uh in Berlin only in
4:23 Dublin but I didn't want to go to duin
4:25 so then I decided to go to Deo which is
4:28 a Consulting company they were just uh
4:31 building up this Deo analytics Institute
4:34 which had the focus on engineering and
4:36 data science so basically started out
4:39 there as a
4:41 consultant and um stayed there for about
4:44 two years which was quite interesting
4:47 because you could basically look into
4:49 different Industries but I also had the
4:51 chance to work with very different
4:53 machine learning use cases so worked on
4:55 image recognition nip but also time
4:58 series animal
5:00 uh detection so very broad range of
5:02 things but it was usually more on a
5:05 proof of concept level so I wanted to to
5:09 go a little bit deeper into the topics
5:11 and then decided to to move on from Deo
5:15 um then moved on to atka digital
5:19 um briefly um which was like an in-house
5:23 consultency for the UTA group did some
5:25 forecasting and time series there but
5:28 then felt like okay I actually want to
5:30 work with bigger data sets and really do
5:33 machine learning so that is why I then
5:36 moved on to Mobility which at the same
5:39 at that time was still part of eBay and
5:41 is a platform where you can buy or sell
5:44 cars and yeah they then definitely had
5:47 more
5:48 data um and was working I was working on
5:52 costal inference there so we were
5:54 looking into whether um certain
5:59 purchases were made because of the
6:01 customer received uh advertisement
6:03 before or certain um marketing
6:07 campaign and then yeah I actually moved
6:11 on to Amazon because I um had the chance
6:13 to join the Amazon Alexa team in Berlin
6:17 and since my passion actually already or
6:21 always has been in natural language
6:23 processing and and working with language
6:25 again uh this was like the perfect yeah
6:29 perfect
6:29 opportunity to combine
6:32 this and then after
6:36 Amazon after Amazon so yeah now I'm
6:39 working as a freelance generative AI
6:43 consultant um in abling small and medium
6:47 businesses to prepare for the Gen AI
6:51 Revolution that we're going to witness
6:53 in the next
6:55 years I have a lot of questions about
6:57 that but first I was C curious to learn
7:00 more about your transition from a data
7:02 scientist to a research scientist
7:04 because I remember so when I was working
7:06 as a data
7:08 scientist I kind of missed doing a bit
7:10 of research so I was like usually you
7:13 work on this uh industry problems but
7:16 like you just take XG boost you apply it
7:18 or I don't know logistic regression
7:20 apply it and then roll it out to
7:22 production and then you spend most of
7:24 the time like either preparing the data
7:26 or deploying the model and like this
7:28 machine learning part was only like I
7:30 don't know one day of work and the rest
7:32 like the entire I don't know like six
7:35 month is some other work and I was kind
7:39 of missing like um you know the research
7:42 part the the this uh algorith thing part
7:46 and I once tried to apply to research
7:49 scientist position I think it was back
7:50 then at it was at zanda and they told me
7:54 something like hey like you don't have a
7:55 PhD like maybe get first get a PhD first
7:59 and then we'll talk but you don't seem
8:01 to have a PhD like how did you actually
8:04 convince Amazon to hire you without a
8:08 phg yeah actually um I think it's
8:11 changing a bit I I mean of course there
8:13 are still a lot of um research worlds
8:16 where you have to have a PhD but then it
8:19 also depends on the company and Amazon
8:21 in general is a company that isn't like
8:24 doesn't have pure research roles like
8:27 deep mind or Google brand something so
8:30 it's always a bit more um with focus on
8:33 customer problems and application and
8:35 how to bring it to
8:36 production um so I mean I think now they
8:40 also changed it in in their uh job
8:42 descriptions where it says like okay you
8:44 either have a PhD or relevant work
8:47 experience and then I think another
8:49 reason why I got the job is because I
8:53 think the team was still kind of young
8:57 and they were looking for people people
8:59 to join uh yeah and in the beginning it
9:02 it's always a bit easier to get in and
9:05 then I think for our team specifically
9:08 what we had like a mixture of people
9:11 with a PhD and people without a PhD so I
9:13 think that is why it worked because then
9:16 uh you can also really learn from the
9:18 people who have a PhD some things that
9:21 you might uh miss or some some skills
9:23 that you might miss and
9:26 um yeah that's how it worked
9:30 MH well I guess this requirement um
9:33 comes
9:34 from so the reason exist is because the
9:37 companies are interested in knowing if
9:40 you can do research or not and if you
9:42 have a PhD then clearly you you know how
9:44 to do research right because you
9:45 published like at least I know three
9:47 papers and then like you defended the
9:49 thesis you clearly know how to do
9:51 research like if you haven't done that
9:55 then it's not clear if you can do this
9:57 or not right because it requires patient
9:59 it patience it requires I don't know
10:02 some research mindset which not everyone
10:05 has yes I I think yes but then also I
10:08 think research at Amazon in this role is
10:11 not exactly like research in Academia
10:14 where you then you know work three years
10:16 on one topic
10:18 and so I I think maybe they also realize
10:21 that okay people with certain industry
10:24 experience um they also bring some
10:26 qualities to the table right and I think
10:28 maybe
10:29 they found out that if we mix the teams
10:32 uh we have a good combination of of the
10:35 two and we can actually leverage both
10:38 skill
10:40 sets so you said that research at Amazon
10:44 is not the same as research in Academia
10:46 so how does research at Amazon look like
10:48 like what do you actually do there yeah
10:50 I mean just okay I mean the way that I
10:53 heard from from my colleagues right how
10:55 research Works in Academia I mean it's
10:57 not like I mean I I only did my master
10:59 thes I didn't do a PhD but I have like a
11:02 rough understanding of how it works
11:05 there um but yeah let me explain how it
11:08 works at Amazon because I definitely
11:09 have a better understanding there like I
11:12 said I mean there's this principle in
11:13 Amazon that you always do uh research
11:15 with a focus on on a on the customer
11:18 problem right so you never just do
11:21 research to solve any kind of problem
11:23 but it always has to be a customer
11:25 problem and you always have to focus on
11:28 the applic
11:29 and how to bring it into the production
11:31 system afterwards so from the beginning
11:34 from the very beginning before you even
11:37 start the research project you already
11:38 know how it will be applied right or you
11:40 have to know before you start Yeah so
11:43 basically before you start there's two
11:45 things you need to look into so or three
11:47 things so first what is the customer
11:49 problem like how do we Define the
11:51 problem clearly then second what are the
11:54 possible solutions and how are they
11:55 going to solve the customer problem so
11:58 really also we did some estimates on on
12:00 impact and and all these kind of things
12:02 and then yeah how can you bring it into
12:05 production what's the effort to bring it
12:07 into production Is it feasible to to
12:09 roll out to
12:12 production yeah and and then I think the
12:17 what it kind of differentiates from this
12:19 normal data science role then that you
12:21 talked about is so you work with Cutting
12:25 Edge machine learning models there right
12:27 you don't learn with you don't work with
12:30 XG boost like you mentioned so you
12:31 really work with state-of-the-art
12:34 research uh so you look into the papers
12:36 you look at existing approaches and then
12:39 you adapt them to your problem at hand
12:43 and this is really cool because Amazon
12:46 also really promotes this kind of strong
12:48 link to Academia where you really rely
12:51 on Cutting Edge research to to um solve
12:56 these customer problems and of course
12:57 also the models that we work with with
12:59 uh were already quite
13:01 um yeah at at the state-ofthe-art and
13:05 then one part um that I also didn't do
13:07 in any other job before was really
13:09 publishing papers so we had a goal each
13:12 year to publish papers in academic
13:15 conferences for example ACL or emn and
13:18 we also attended academic conferences
13:21 whereas in my previous role as a data
13:23 scientist I usually uh went to those
13:26 industry oriented conferences
13:30 that's interesting because like I know
13:33 that publishing papers in these top tier
13:35 conferences is already hard enough but
13:38 in addition to that you also have to
13:40 think like how am I going to put this
13:42 thing into production so you kind of
13:44 have two jobs in one right exactly it's
13:47 challenging it's not easy but um I also
13:50 have to say um so there is not only the
13:54 research track anymore uh but these
13:56 conferences now also off often have
13:59 industry tracks so there it's it's not
14:02 that much about the novelty of the the
14:05 approach and you and especially what's
14:07 important is you also don't necessarily
14:10 have to um publish results on open
14:13 source data sets because sometimes we
14:15 didn't have the time to rerun
14:17 experiments on an open source data set
14:19 but of course we couldn't uh release the
14:21 data set that we were using for our
14:23 experiments so yeah most of the time we
14:26 I mean we there are also teams and and
14:28 and scientists who publish at the
14:31 research track but um we also published
14:34 in the industry track a
14:36 lot because for these conferences for
14:39 these industry tracks uh tracks what is
14:42 interesting is the applications of the
14:45 state-ofthe-art methods right uh so one
14:49 uh one thing is like yes you can develop
14:51 this state-ofthe-art
14:53 uh algorithm and then test it on like
14:56 usual benchmarks but what about applying
14:59 it to real life problems and this is
15:01 what you do right and then you publish
15:03 research on that like we had this
15:05 problem and this is how we used the
15:09 State ofthe
15:10 art yeah I mean sometimes we also
15:12 extended the State ofthe art thing you
15:14 know it's not like there was no novelty
15:16 at all but it's maybe not as much
15:19 novelty as it would have to be for the
15:21 research track and then also there was
15:23 less overhead let's say in publishing in
15:25 the industry track because usually we
15:27 run experiment on internal data sets and
15:31 then running experiments on public data
15:33 sets is extra work which you don't
15:36 always have the time
15:37 for yeah when it comes to novelty I
15:40 remember like eight years ago when I was
15:42 doing my masters at T Berlin and one of
15:45 the criteria for the Masters was novelty
15:48 and I'm like okay I'm a student like I
15:51 don't know much and now you asked me to
15:54 work on like novelty like how is it even
15:57 possible and then what my advisor told
15:59 me was that taking existing things and
16:04 applying to something to a data set or
16:07 category or domain that nobody has
16:09 applied and seeing what the results are
16:11 is already like super novel so you can
16:14 yeah that's true exactly that's also one
16:16 way to go and that's also something that
16:18 we did right I mean taking something
16:20 from image and applying it to
16:22 NLP
16:25 yeah okay yeah and uh I'm curious
16:29 so the goal was actually solving
16:31 customers problem but yet you had
16:34 another goal papers which was more
16:38 important the main kpi the main kpi is
16:42 customer problems because that's also
16:43 where you kind of I mean that's the
16:46 first thing that you do right that's the
16:48 work that you do and then afterwards you
16:50 might publish the paper yeah so
16:54 you m so you have two kpis but the one
16:58 the the business metric is more
17:00 important like that you solve the
17:02 customer problem and then uh papers are
17:05 more like nice to have right or it's
17:07 still important to like if you don't
17:09 publish then you're not researcher
17:12 right yeah I mean it's still important I
17:15 mean there is there is internal goals
17:16 for papers um I mean also Amazon has an
17:19 interest in in people publishing right
17:21 because it helps their reputation it
17:23 helps them attract talent but then I
17:27 also for you as a scientists right that
17:29 is you are intrinsically very motivated
17:32 to do that right because it's a nice way
17:35 to to sum up your work and to Showcase
17:37 it and to also go into that exchange
17:40 with other uh people but of course I
17:42 mean the first one is always the
17:44 customer problem and the business and
17:46 then and then the paper
17:48 yeah and as we speak I'm looking now at
17:51 your uh LinkedIn profile and I see that
17:54 you worked at Amazon for three years
17:55 nine months so almost four years MH how
17:58 many papers how many research projects
18:01 did you get a chance to work
18:03 on so research projects more than papers
18:06 we didn't always have the time to to
18:09 publish I mean research
18:12 projects I think four or five so usually
18:15 you have like one so one per year
18:16 approximately right exactly you have
18:18 like one Focus project per year um and
18:22 then papers I think it's four
18:24 papers yeah in your Google Scholar that
18:27 I have open right now it's four it's
18:30 four yeah it's like one paper per year
18:32 too right so five projects four
18:35 papers yeah I mean the project also it
18:38 depends right I mean I definitely had
18:39 more than five projects but then the
18:41 question is H what is your role in the
18:43 project right are you the the leading
18:45 scientist on that one or are you just uh
18:48 contributing uh or giving feedback um
18:51 but yeah I think it was like five or six
18:54 where I was the lead in like research
18:56 projects but then we also have other
18:58 project so I also had like a more
19:01 software project I mean it's you don't
19:04 only have research
19:06 tasks what does it mean to be a leading
19:09 scientist on a
19:10 project so that means you are the owner
19:13 of the project right you you are
19:15 responsible
19:16 for for kind of defining the problem
19:20 trying out different solutions
19:21 communicating with
19:23 stakeholders uh you know kind of giving
19:29 the initial approaches and and then I
19:32 mean you can of course work with other
19:34 people and go collect feedback and and
19:37 ideas and input but you are the the main
19:40 responsible person to yeah successfully
19:43 finish the
19:45 project must be not easy like if you
19:48 come from industry without much research
19:51 experience apart from writing your
19:53 master thesis and now you have all of a
19:55 sudden to lead a science project that's
19:58 probably not the easiest thing to do
20:01 right well I didn't find it that
20:04 difficult like actually I really enjoyed
20:06 it because I really missed this research
20:09 part and this part of reading about new
20:11 approaches and learning and trying out
20:13 new things instead of instead of just
20:15 going to the standard solutions that you
20:17 already know and have in the back of the
20:19 mind and I mean of course
20:23 it's yeah I
20:25 think you also kind of
20:29 you you grow into that um I mean I think
20:32 my first project also was about this
20:36 labeling
20:37 um like how to to label data efficiently
20:41 and this is of course a bit easier than
20:43 maybe later on when we looked into aders
20:45 how to generate adversarial attacks um
20:48 with a T5 model this has more technical
20:50 complexity and then of course what I
20:52 have to say you also have a lot of
20:54 support at Amazon so this really great
20:56 you have a lot of competent people
20:58 around you and you really have this
21:00 culture of collaboration so whoever you
21:02 reach out to they will always be happy
21:05 to support you and I really enjoyed the
21:08 challenge to kind of yeah catch up on
21:12 this and also Pro that you don't need to
21:15 have a PhD to be a scientist right yeah
21:19 yeah I mean I for me it was not really
21:22 about proving I mean yes of course there
21:24 was this topic okay do I need a PhD
21:27 don't I need a PhD but I was just happy
21:30 that finally you know I could do the
21:32 task that I
21:33 enjoy um yeah yeah the reason I brought
21:37 it up because there is a question from
21:38 matita and the question is how does
21:40 having a PhD
21:43 help getting some leverage over those
21:45 who doesn't cuz I guess the reason she's
21:49 asking uh as I see from the
21:52 question like do you really need to have
21:55 a PhD like does it really give you the
21:57 edge when it comes to doing research at
22:01 industry companies like Amazon well I
22:04 mean it so first of all I mean it it
22:07 definitely can be right it depends on
22:09 the team it depends on the hiring
22:10 manager I mean there are teams in in
22:14 managers who have that as a first
22:16 requirement right so if you want to go
22:18 to one of their teams then you
22:20 definitely need it once you're in I
22:23 don't know I think it depends a lot on
22:25 you um it also depends on what kind of
22:28 PhD you did maybe but it's also a bit
22:30 hard for me to say because I don't
22:33 really know what the benefit I mean what
22:36 you really take out of it right because
22:38 I didn't do it I mean yeah difficult to
22:41 say you yeah see I mean I I think yes
22:46 it's it can be an entry ticket and
22:48 probably you learn some skills that are
22:50 useful but then on the other hand I also
22:53 can you can also argue it the other way
22:55 right
22:56 um I I I think it's it it really depends
22:59 on where you want to go and if if in
23:01 that environment you really need it and
23:04 if you want to do it
23:06 like
23:09 yeah and yeah I'm looking at your Google
23:12 Scholar and there is one paper with six
23:15 citations that he published in 2021
23:18 which is like is it better to verify
23:20 semi-supervised learning with a human in
23:22 the loop for large scale nlu
23:26 models yeah it's um a long name so maybe
23:30 can you tell us more about
23:32 this yes yes uh yeah so basically let me
23:37 give you a quick uh introduction of the
23:40 setup that we were working in so
23:41 basically we so my team was in charge of
23:45 the natural language understanding
23:47 models for German and French and we
23:50 would have to update these models uh on
23:52 a regular basis so we would retrain them
23:57 um
23:58 every time before we release them
24:01 and well among other things we also
24:04 added new training data in each update
24:07 and this training data would I mean some
24:10 of the training data would come from um
24:13 random sample of live
24:15 traffic and the old process was that
24:18 basically this um training data gets
24:21 annotated by human annotators before we
24:24 ingested into training and as you can
24:27 imagine this is quite costly and time
24:30 consuming and of course not something um
24:33 that's desirable for a business so we
24:36 thought about okay how can we save some
24:38 cost speed up the process and and so
24:41 forth and the solution that we describe
24:44 in the paper is
24:47 basically in instead of showing the
24:50 annotator just the simple request
24:53 without any hints on how to annotate or
24:55 anything we run this request through the
24:57 the nlu model and show the annotator the
24:59 output from the nlu model so then the
25:02 annotator just has to understand okay is
25:05 the nlu model right if yes you know just
25:08 takes it off and sends it right into the
25:10 training set and if not they just they
25:13 only have to correct they don't have to
25:15 annotate the full utterance from
25:18 scratch so it saves time right it saves
25:21 time exactly uh but it also reduces the
25:24 The annotation volume a lot because I
25:26 mean if you're imag you know Alexa was
25:30 launched I think seven or eight years
25:32 ago now and then German was one of the
25:36 uh first languages that came after
25:38 English so the model already has has
25:42 some kind of maturity you know it
25:44 already has a certain level of accuracy
25:46 so actually the annotator doesn't have
25:48 to make that many um
25:54 Corrections and yeah another thing that
25:56 we found is quite interesting actually
25:57 with that we didn't expect was it also
26:00 leads to more consistent annotation so
26:04 because if you can imagine you just show
26:05 the utterance to the annotator and then
26:07 they just annotate as they think they
26:09 don't have like a primer or some kind of
26:11 bias which sometimes could also lead to
26:14 the same utterance being annotated in a
26:17 different way which gave us
26:19 inconsistencies in the training set and
26:22 through this approach uh since the model
26:24 gives you one interpretation then all
26:26 the annotators get bu into One Direction
26:29 you have more consistency in the
26:31 training
26:32 data yeah you might have my voice
26:35 somewhere in the training data cuz U
26:38 yeah I have an Alexa speaker and we use
26:42 German CU my son speaks only Russian and
26:44 German he doesn't speak English so then
26:47 we okay let's I will practice PR
26:51 pronounce in in German and we'll see
26:52 like if Alexa understands me or
26:55 not so maybe you have that in the
26:57 training data too maybe
27:00 yeah but the overall the product problem
27:03 was you wanted to improve the accuracy
27:06 of Alexa
27:07 right yeah I mean okay the customer
27:10 problem in this is is one is accuracy
27:12 yes but then of course I mean sometimes
27:15 their projects were also aimed in
27:17 improving our internal processes and
27:19 reducing cost yeah so in this case it
27:23 was uh mostly driven by cost reduction
27:26 but then at the end it also impacted
27:28 accuracy cuz like you have better data
27:30 set and like there's already a process
27:33 where you bring in more
27:35 data to improve the model and you just
27:38 wanted to make this process cheaper
27:41 right cheaper faster
27:46 yeah and how do you evaluate the
27:48 performance of these models like just
27:51 You by by looking at well I guess you
27:54 send it to the annotators right they say
27:56 yes no right
27:58 and so usually we we just have test sets
28:01 we have a bunch of of different test
28:03 sets so after training the model is just
28:05 run on different test sets and then we
28:09 just look at certain kinds of
28:12 metrics yeah I mean sometimes yeah for
28:15 very high performing utterances we would
28:18 also do some extra checks to make sure
28:21 that uh they still work after retraining
28:24 the model that was actually one of the
28:26 the other uh projects I worked on to
28:28 reduce this effort of really making sure
28:32 that all the high traffic utterances
28:34 still work after retraining um we worked
28:38 on approach to uh make make the model
28:42 more stable um so when you basically
28:44 retrain it you put more weight on
28:47 utterances that have high traffic such
28:49 that they get interpreted
28:52 correctly I remember for me the main
28:55 problem was uh with Alexa
28:58 um when I ask it to play a song like I
29:02 say first like
29:04 SP like I say in German right and then
29:07 the song name is in English oh okay and
29:10 I think like maybe it didn't always get
29:13 the song name correctly because like
29:15 it's okay I don't know how these models
29:17 work with like when you mix two
29:20 languages yeah it should actually work
29:23 because I mean the song name is an
29:25 entity right and we keep those entities
29:28 in
29:29 English if the song name I mean if it's
29:31 an English song right then it should
29:34 work maybe but it could of course also
29:36 be an ASR issue right that the ASR model
29:38 didn't properly transcribe
29:42 myON yeah so that could lead to ASR
29:44 issues but sometimes also yeah if the
29:47 song is not very popular it can be that
29:49 it just doesn't work that well well
29:51 songs by Queen were like most of the
29:54 time like it played the song I asked
29:57 like if it's popular like queen or
30:00 something like that like popular songs
30:02 less popular yeah like you're right
30:04 guess it depends on how much traffic you
30:07 get for particular songs right exactly
30:10 yeah because I mean if something goes
30:12 wrong then more often it goes wrong
30:14 there higher the probability someone
30:15 else will notice and fix it it was like
30:18 a song that somebody asks to play once a
30:21 year then okay yeah you're not going to
30:24 find that in in the traffic it's just
30:26 too much L yeah I see I know maybe it's
30:30 internal data but what's the most
30:31 popular request to Alexa I don't know
30:35 and I also would not be allowed to share
30:37 I guess yeah
30:40 okay for me it was mostly timer so I was
30:43 using a to I mean yeah the the most
30:46 popular domains are music timer weather
30:49 like those are used very often and I
30:52 also like I was checking up here it's
30:55 here right cuz like I can use different
30:58 voices but like it was speaking with
31:01 female voice to me I guess a difficult
31:04 question like what's the gender for this
31:06 AI
31:07 model yeah I would just say her probably
31:11 just because the name is already it's
31:12 Alexa right yeah exactly but
31:17 also it's kind of similar to Alexi so
31:20 there is a Funny Story So like um um I
31:23 was talking to my colleague and uh he
31:27 had Alexa in his room and every time he
31:31 said my name Alexa would
31:34 activate yeah yeah of course yeah yeah
31:39 yeah it's close yeah can yeah okay um
31:44 yeah and recently you decided to focus
31:49 on something else on um guess that's
31:52 quite different from what you were doing
31:54 right so now you're a freelancer so
31:56 maybe can you tell us more about that
31:58 like what do you do now and how did you
32:00 make this decision to change uh your
32:04 career and start
32:06 freelancing yeah I
32:08 mean I don't know if it's I mean okay it
32:11 is different in the sense that I'm not
32:13 working on like one model anymore but of
32:17 course in there is still going to be
32:19 quite some overlap in terms of topic
32:21 yeah so because I mean as I said before
32:24 um my goal is to support company needs
32:27 in the adoption of AI especially
32:30 generative AI with text and kind of keep
32:33 them competitive uh in the long run
32:36 because that's going to be crucial um to
32:39 to enhance your
32:40 productivity and I mean there is a lot
32:42 of overlap there right in how you well
32:46 in in the kind of technology that I'm
32:48 I'm working with and then also since I
32:51 worked at deoy before where I was
32:53 already in this technical Consulting
32:55 role uh
32:59 um it there is some overlap there right
33:02 I mean of course the working mode is
33:03 very different because it's the first
33:05 time that I'm not employed anymore so
33:08 this also means um you have to take care
33:12 of everything right now right you have
33:14 to uh uh get new clients get new
33:18 projects you have to Market yourself uh
33:21 you have to promote yourself and I mean
33:24 you also have to send out the invoices
33:26 in the end have to take care of your
33:28 taxes um so so that is of course
33:32 different um I think the second part of
33:34 your question was like how I made this
33:36 decision
33:38 right yeah in general
33:41 um I I think you can have a lot of
33:44 impact um in if you support these
33:48 smaller to mediumsized businesses in
33:50 adopting AI I think in Germany this is
33:53 especially important because we're
33:55 lacking behind with adoption of Ai
33:57 digitalization and Innovation so I see
34:00 that I can have a contribution there but
34:04 in in general I just also wanted to
34:07 think and work in a more entrepreneurial
34:10 way um and having more freedom on top in
34:15 the way how you work what you work on
34:18 who you work with and another thing
34:21 actually that that really led to this
34:23 decision was that I wanted to have the
34:27 possibility to also venture out in new
34:30 areas and that's in kind of you know
34:33 doing several things in parallel I think
34:36 that's easier if you're self-employed
34:38 versus if you're working full-time or
34:41 even just let's say 80 or 75% in our
34:44 corporate so you can consult on projects
34:47 in different domains in different areas
34:49 and then understand okay like maybe I
34:50 like healthcare more than I don't know
34:53 fot
34:54 Tech yeah or maybe also just doing
34:57 something completely different on on on
34:59 the side right kind of having different
35:02 things that you do not just doing one
35:05 thing five days a week anymore you mean
35:07 like not doing just data science and
35:09 research but also
35:11 doing I know something else like working
35:14 on your own
35:16 product exactly working on yeah that's
35:18 yeah so working on my own product and
35:23 also other projects um yeah
35:27 like personal projects professional
35:30 projects H yeah I mean so one of or both
35:34 right yeah both and not yeah and and
35:37 maybe also have a bit more overlap
35:39 between the two right because h i mean
35:42 one of the things that I want to do is
35:43 is uh is support women in AI so maybe
35:47 you know about this um yeah study from M
35:51 kiny digital that half of the women
35:54 leave leave Tech in indry at the
35:58 midpoint of their career which is double
35:59 the rate as as men do and so you mean
36:03 leave and then do not come back exactly
36:06 so leave for good they just leave behind
36:08 the industry and this is of
36:12 course I guess because like women need
36:16 to give birth to kids right and then
36:18 like they stay longer with kids usually
36:21 than men is it the reason or the reason
36:23 is something else no but I think that's
36:26 not the only reason I mean I think yes
36:29 part of it is that because they don't
36:32 feel like they have enough
36:33 flexibility uh to to kind of combine the
36:38 job with the family but
36:41 then I think in the article also said
36:43 that a lot of women still feel like they
36:46 have to uh do more to be successful they
36:49 feel isolated they don't feel
36:52 recognized um they think it's hard to to
36:55 get promoted and
36:57 um I think they they just also get a bit
37:00 frustrated uh with with these things
37:04 that are part of or that are at least to
37:08 some extent due to a lack of diversity
37:10 in in the
37:14 industry so you want to support women
37:16 there was this research and I
37:18 interrupted you yeah ex yeah so that is
37:21 one of the the the other project that I
37:23 want to work on and I'm not exactly sure
37:26 how it's going to look like I'm still
37:28 working on on the concept how I'm going
37:30 to do that but it's definitely something
37:33 I want to spend more time on um yeah and
37:36 that is of course easier in a in a
37:38 freelance role um yeah I'm going to
37:41 share updates on on LinkedIn so if
37:43 anyone is interested you follow there so
37:45 we should make sure we follow you right
37:52 yeah okay and um when I became self
37:57 employed this year I was very surprised
37:59 how expensive is health insurance in
38:02 German maybe it's less expensive than in
38:04 the states yes but still like when all
38:08 these costs like all these um taxes are
38:11 hidden and being a full-time employee
38:15 you just receive your salary you don't
38:16 worry about like all the taxes uh health
38:20 insurance like pension all that right
38:22 you just receive like certain amount of
38:25 money on your bank account and keep go
38:27 spend it right but now you receive some
38:30 money then you need to set apart some
38:31 money for paying tax right and then like
38:34 all of a sudden it turns out you have to
38:35 pay €900 to health insurance every month
38:39 right and then like for me it was a
38:42 surprising
38:43 like yeah now you have to deal with all
38:46 that yourself
38:47 right exactly yes uh and and that's also
38:50 the part that I don't enjoy as much but
38:53 yeah in general I mean what I like is
38:56 really that that I have more variety of
38:58 tasks now
39:00 um yeah can you tell us what you work
39:05 on I mean currently I'm I'm actually
39:08 still just uh working on my positioning
39:11 on my pitch deck on my website uh on
39:14 this women in AI support uh project I
39:18 actually consciously decided to not take
39:21 any projects on this year um at least
39:25 not bigger project
39:27 because I think this initial phase of
39:29 you know setting yourself up uh and also
39:33 frankly taking a bit of a break
39:36 after after Amazon um yeah I think it's
39:41 quite important so so that you really
39:43 feel prepared and and uh recharged and I
39:48 could imagine that once you really get
39:50 into projects you might not have the
39:52 head State anymore to think more about
39:54 strategic things
39:57 mhm can you tell us a bit more about
39:59 this positioning uh pitch Teck like you
40:02 probably have started already and let's
40:05 say I um let's imagine I want to I work
40:08 as a full-time employee and now I
40:11 thought okay I want to be a freelancer
40:14 right
40:16 so what do I do now how how do I
40:18 position myself how do I come up with
40:20 this pitch
40:22 deck yeah I think it's a combination of
40:25 okay what are my skills what are my
40:26 strengths like what can I what value do
40:29 I bring and then you kind of look on the
40:32 other side okay what is it that
40:35 potential customers need like what is my
40:37 target group there what are their
40:38 problems how can I support them and then
40:41 you try to find this intersection and
40:44 you basically
40:47 Define the problems that they have and
40:49 that they want to solve um so you kind
40:51 of put them in their shoes and imagine
40:54 okay what is it that they really W to
40:56 tackle and how can I support them with
40:58 that and then I mean what I also did I
41:00 mean now in my specific case is all this
41:03 uh transformation that's going to happen
41:05 with generative AI so basically I look
41:09 into okay what are some studies that uh
41:11 kind of underpin
41:15 um or show how gen is going transform
41:18 the way we work and then you just kind
41:21 of also showcase your skills your
41:24 experience and you define certain
41:27 offerings uh so for example in my case
41:30 it's something like a generative AI
41:32 Discovery Workshop where this can be
41:34 something in between half a day to two
41:37 days uh and it can be just you know an
41:39 introduction to generative AI or it can
41:41 already go more into use case definition
41:45 for that certain
41:47 client um so you set up or you define
41:49 certain offerings
41:52 um to to Showcase them how you can
41:55 support them
41:57 yeah okay so with skills that I have
42:01 with strengths and values that I can
42:04 bring it's more or less clear maybe it's
42:07 not like always I always know that this
42:09 is these are my strengths but I more or
42:13 less know what I'm good at what I'm not
42:14 good at if I work full-time
42:16 right but when it comes to knowing what
42:20 potential customers want and who are
42:23 these potential customers like in first
42:25 place like it's more problematic cuz
42:27 like I might have no idea yes I know
42:30 that I'm good at let's
42:33 say I know machine learning deployment
42:36 deploy models right I know that I can do
42:39 this but how with this knowledge with
42:42 the knowledge of the skills I have and
42:44 values I can uh bring to the company how
42:47 can I find the potential customers
42:50 identify the group and like understand
42:52 what they struggle
42:54 with yeah I mean one thing could be you
42:56 just uh you know find people in your
42:58 network that work for companies uh that
43:02 you might want to work for and then talk
43:04 to them like what are you struggling
43:05 with is there anything you struggle with
43:07 in that area where you bring those
43:09 skills or I mean one thing that I do now
43:13 is um I'm so I'm a mentor in in the data
43:19 action um data Action Network mentorship
43:23 program so this is a program where
43:25 basically start UPS can book a call with
43:28 mentors so they pay a subscription fee
43:30 and then they can book a call with
43:31 mentors and they they just talk to you
43:35 about some of the problems that they
43:36 have so this of course then also helps
43:38 me to understand um what what problems
43:43 they are trying to solve and another
43:45 thing is yeah sometime I mean sometimes
43:48 you know you just say you work freelance
43:51 you introduce yourself on LinkedIn as a
43:53 freelancer and on certain networks and
43:55 so on and then sometimes people already
43:58 reach out to you and then you just talk
44:00 to them and try to understand um what
44:02 they're looking for what the problems
44:04 are that they're trying to solve and
44:06 this all gives you ideas and then of
44:08 course it's only a starting point right
44:10 and then once you do your first project
44:12 you can always iterate an update second
44:14 project and so
44:17 on okay so I know what my strengths and
44:20 skills are then I should have some
44:23 Network and some companies where I want
44:26 to work and then reach out to people in
44:28 this company saying hey like I a
44:31 freelancer I can help you like maybe we
44:34 can talk and then I start asking what
44:37 they need help with right and then I see
44:39 okay like these are the
44:41 problems this is yeah or you just ask
44:44 the people that you know right maybe
44:46 it's a bit easier in the beginning uh
44:48 right instead of like going this like uh
44:52 Cod calls on LinkedIn maybe they're not
44:54 going to immediately share the problems
44:56 with you but you can ask people that you
44:57 know or you go to to events like I think
45:01 there was
45:02 this there was like this event called
45:04 seamless what which was about uh the
45:07 payment industry and I mean if you just
45:09 look up events in Berlin Tech events in
45:12 Berlin you can also find quite
45:15 interesting helpful events where you can
45:17 meet potential clients or learn more
45:20 about an industry and what they string
45:23 yeah yeah and you mentioned also
45:26 mentoring and this is actually an
45:28 interesting thing so people come to you
45:31 to tell you about their problems right
45:32 and then you can take notes what kind of
45:35 problems there there are and I guess the
45:38 volume is uh like a few people ask for
45:42 like a short mentorship call and then
45:43 like you can summarize you can see
45:47 patterns there like startups come with I
45:50 don't know this sort of problem right
45:51 and then you can see okay like
45:53 interesting I can help them yeah exactly
45:56 that and then yeah also reading market
45:58 research right I mean now if you Google
46:01 it's I mean of course I'm in a lucky
46:02 position that this generative AI topic
46:05 is now very much hyped right so you find
46:07 a lot of reports on how this is going to
46:10 transform the way we work and how it's
46:12 going to um be or what new problems uh
46:16 companies will have to solve with the
46:18 adoption of that right so you can really
46:20 also just go and find market research
46:23 from consultancies or Banks yeah
46:27 mhm yeah and with approach with
46:30 mentoring is pretty interesting cuz uh
46:32 like I spoke with a few people so I
46:34 spoke with one uh guy who is doing
46:38 courses and I asked him like how did you
46:41 come up with these courses that you
46:42 offer and he said that first he did not
46:45 offer any courses what he offered was
46:48 mentorship so he got a few students who
46:52 who he would
46:53 mentor and then he would ask them what
46:56 they struggle with right and then like
46:58 from I don't know six 10 students he was
47:00 able to understand that most people at
47:03 least from this 10 uh struggle with
47:05 these problems and then based on that he
47:07 developed the course I guess it's sort
47:09 of similar right so you take a few
47:13 shortterm sort of clients like these
47:15 people you Mentor mes then you speak
47:18 with them you understand what they
47:19 struggle with and then based on that you
47:21 shape
47:22 your offering right your you shape your
47:25 position
47:27 yeah exactly or at least you have like a
47:28 first stance on it right and then you do
47:30 the first project and then you iterate
47:32 and then I mean eventually this can also
47:35 lead in into creating a product right if
47:38 you see that okay every almost every
47:41 client has the same problem then yeah
47:44 maybe you can think about how can I
47:46 create a product to to provide a
47:48 solution for
47:50 that yeah why did you decide to go with
47:53 the generative II I mean this is very
47:57 close to to what I did at Amazon and of
47:59 course like I said before it's uh
48:01 natural language processing is always
48:03 has always been the area that I'm most
48:05 passionate about I really like it and I
48:08 mean now the recent developments of
48:11 course very very easy right to make this
48:14 decision to focus on that and it's yeah
48:17 it's very mind-blowing and interesting
48:19 and I like this intersection of of you
48:22 know human and machine and this is
48:24 exactly what language is
48:26 yeah what the these big large language
48:28 models are yeah you probably cannot
48:31 comment on that but I was always
48:32 wondering what happens if we plug Alexa
48:35 to
48:36 charp that would be awesome
48:39 right
48:41 well you don't have to say
48:46 anything okay
48:48 um yeah so where we were um so now you
48:54 work on um
48:56 position yourself and your pitch deck
48:59 right so what does come to the pitch
49:01 deck like what we discussed right now
49:04 but like in a short deck
49:07 right yeah I mean so now I have a so
49:11 what I'm doing first is building like a
49:12 long deck uh that has a couple of slides
49:15 that really has like everything in it
49:17 like basically some slides that show
49:20 okay why do you have to act on this
49:23 generative AI Revolution
49:26 um what are the facts right and then
49:30 what can generative AI do what are the
49:33 what is the potential what are the risks
49:36 and then some slides on who I am what my
49:39 experience is why I um why I'm in a good
49:42 position to take on or support uh
49:44 clients in in this task and
49:48 then yeah some some slides regarding my
49:51 offering some slides um I actually also
49:54 have list of um reference projects from
49:58 my um corporate career in there and then
50:02 also your daily rate and how to get in
50:05 touch so this is a very long
50:07 presentation but then once I have this
50:09 long pitch deck you know I can just
50:12 shorten it based on on the audience or
50:15 on the
50:17 need and then I mean I can also build
50:19 the website based on on that it's just a
50:22 different kind of uh display format yeah
50:25 so I guess it's needed for an interview
50:27 right so when uh I'm interviewed I'm
50:30 being interviewed for a full-time
50:31 position like there is a process like I
50:34 need to first talk I don't know with
50:35 with recruiters and hiring manager then
50:38 there is a set of technical interviews
50:40 but for Freelancers I guess this is an
50:43 interview where you present this
50:45 deck
50:46 right yeah well I don't think you can
50:49 get a project if you don't have a pitch
50:52 Tech I mean I already had some requests
50:55 and could have started working on a
50:58 project even without a website without a
51:01 pach MH but
51:04 I I'm choosing to do that because I
51:06 think it helps me position myself
51:09 because I want to work on certain topics
51:12 and I want to be standing for certain
51:15 topics right not not just anything and
51:17 everything and it's also an interesting
51:20 thing because as I said I want to think
51:23 more entrepreneurial and this is part of
51:26 of that um and I it's it's fun it's I
51:30 like also you know venturing out in a
51:33 new field where I
51:34 haven't yeah where I don't have that
51:36 much experience in learning something
51:38 new so so
51:41 yeah so even without this pitch Tech you
51:45 already got some potential projects like
51:48 how is it because uh people from your
51:51 network already know that you are a fre
51:53 freelancer and they hey come to us
51:55 before somebody else took your it yeah
51:59 it's basically Network and also posts on
52:03 LinkedIn like posting I'm a freelancer
52:07 now posting yeah definitely so posts
52:11 with machine learning content and
52:15 yeah and I mean like I said before you
52:18 know I'm in this lucky position that
52:20 currently this generative AI you know
52:23 there there's a need for a lot of exps
52:26 so the demand is higher than the supply
52:28 so that's this of
52:30 course makes it easier for me so what do
52:34 you post about typically on LinkedIn
52:37 yeah I post about very different things
52:39 I mean I I post about uh machine
52:42 learning and and how to you know I mean
52:45 I post about my papers of course uh I
52:47 posted about how to deliver value with
52:50 machine learning I I will post about how
52:53 to combine design thinking with machine
52:54 learning to tailor to the user needs and
52:58 but I also post a lot about you know
53:00 things I learn things that help me I
53:03 really also like personal growth topics
53:07 um so basically anything that I find
53:11 interesting yeah I'm looking at your I'm
53:14 looking at your feet right now and what
53:16 caught my attention is exactly not a
53:18 post about machine learing so there
53:20 there's a a picture where you sit on the
53:24 floor and and there are like different
53:27 um things I don't even know what is that
53:32 Crystal Crystal bowls yeah
53:37 yeah it's Crystal bowls so they are
53:40 bowls made of quartz and you basically
53:43 play them and then they make a very
53:45 soothing calming sound and usually you
53:48 know people would just lie down close
53:51 their eyes you would play the bows and
53:54 then the sound waves have a very
53:57 physical effect on their body right so
53:59 they slow down their brain
54:01 waves and also you can feel the sound
54:04 different areas of your body and this
54:06 helps people to go into a relaxed and
54:09 calm State and I discovered that for
54:12 myself like two years ago and got a very
54:16 yeah really really L doing sound bus so
54:20 yeah now sometimes I also give sound
54:24 BS of my side
54:26 projects that I mentioned
54:29 before interesting now you have more
54:32 flexibility to actually do this
54:35 right well I mean I also did that while
54:38 I was working at Amazon I mean sound
54:40 Bast you know it's something you do for
54:42 an hour it's it's not like another full
54:46 job yeah and I actually also did one at
54:48 Amazon which was pretty cool in the
54:51 office in the office yeah do you have
54:55 any of these balls somewhere near you
54:58 right now h no no sorry not here but I
55:02 can send you a YouTube video if you want
55:04 to listen okay yeah please recorded
55:07 video okay that's very
55:10 interesting yeah let me check if we have
55:12 questions yeah a question from
55:15 Tas uh Tas asks what role did your
55:18 formal education school and University
55:21 play in your
55:24 career
55:25 what role it played in my career I mean
55:28 yeah it was definitely the foundation
55:30 right
55:31 because I think coming from a technical
55:35 background is is important if you want
55:36 to work in machine learning and
55:38 statistics and probability of course is
55:41 closely related to the field
55:45 um so it was it was the foundation and
55:48 also I think being able to read
55:51 technical papers being able to read
55:55 mathematical equations I mean of course
55:57 you can always learn things later
56:01 but the earlier you start with that the
56:04 easier it is and yeah and
56:09 you studed m learning during your
56:12 Masters
56:13 right yeah exactly but then of course it
56:15 didn't stop there right you you
56:18 always it's like uh did you also attend
56:23 machine learning courses the machine
56:25 learning course from Technical
56:26 University or it was some other
56:28 university no actually I attended the
56:30 one at humbard University okay Dr at the
56:34 Technical University there is um he's
56:36 quite famous Professor Miller he worked
56:39 on uh support Vector
56:41 machines um right and this is what he
56:43 taught mostly like because he did a lot
56:46 of research in this area so in many of
56:49 his classes he was teaching support
56:50 Vector machines and all these things uh
56:54 and then yeah yeah I learned that but
56:56 then when I graduated turned out that
56:59 umms aren't that
57:02 common to my surprise and then like okay
57:05 now I need to learn about like other
57:07 methods that are more common like neural
57:09 networks yeah and then like of course
57:11 education didn't stop there yeah I mean
57:14 the good so so I attended the course by
57:17 Professor Dr Lesman uh he works at the
57:19 Institute of informatics at Hur
57:21 University and what was really nice he
57:24 gave us like a very good overview of all
57:26 the different meth methods and already
57:28 included neural networks there and I
57:30 think one of his courses uh that he did
57:33 during Co is now also on YouTube so that
57:36 is also a good starting point if you
57:37 want to get started with with NLP for
57:40 example he has a couple of lectures on
57:42 NLP which are pretty
57:45 nice yeah for a
57:47 beginner did we cover everything we
57:50 wanted yeah yeah okay okay well maybe
57:55 last question so before we finish is
57:57 there any book or other source that you
57:59 can recommend to our
58:01 listeners yes I
58:03 mean so books there are actually two so
58:06 one that I recently read is a
58:08 entrepreneurial Revolution by Daniel
58:11 prle uh I really enjoyed that one
58:14 because it's a very practical stepbystep
58:17 guide what you need to do to become an
58:19 entrepreneur and how to approach uh yeah
58:23 getting customers defining your
58:24 offerings and and all this uh so I
58:27 really like that one and the other one
58:29 that I recommend um is mindset by Dr
58:33 Carol Dre um something that I read I
58:35 think two years ago and it really yeah
58:39 it changed my my view on you know um
58:44 basically now I'm convinced that you can
58:46 learn anything and
58:49 everything if you if you are dedicated
58:53 enough okay and I find that very
58:55 powerful yeah do they
58:58 only um convince you that you can learn
59:01 everything or they also show how in this
59:04 mindset yeah it's more how to approach
59:06 it um yeah and why it's important to
59:09 have this mindset first and then I think
59:11 it's also easier to put into practice
59:13 and I mean another thing that I can
59:15 recommend which is a bit more technical
59:17 um there's this one podcast that I
59:20 recently listened to unfortunately it's
59:22 only in German but if you you speak
59:25 German it's an interesting explanation
59:27 of how large language models work and
59:30 you also don't need to have a lot of
59:31 prior knowledge um
59:35 yeah it's
59:37 called
59:40 LM so basically how does an artificial
59:43 intelligence learn how to speak I will
59:46 use this as practice tomorrow before my
59:49 German lesson yeah let's see how much I
59:52 will understand I mean actually it's a
59:54 lot of German and English because uh the
59:57 the guest who is being interviewed he is
59:59 German but he moved to the US many many
1:00:01 years ago so it seems like for him
1:00:03 speaking English is also more his it's
1:00:06 also easier for him than speaking also
1:00:08 if you do if you work in English
1:00:10 speaking environment then many terms
1:00:14 like machine learning terms they usually
1:00:16 come up in in
1:00:18 English yeah true yeah I also find it
1:00:22 easier to speak in in English at least
1:00:24 talk about like this exactly yeah for me
1:00:28 it would be difficult to speak about
1:00:29 machine learning in
1:00:31 Russian yeah yeah know I mean also when
1:00:33 I speak about it in German I have this
1:00:35 tendency to use a lot of English words
1:00:37 as well exactly okay thanks a lot for
1:00:41 joining us today for sharing your
1:00:42 experience and telling us about things
1:00:45 you plan to work on and things you
1:00:46 worked on that was really great thanks
1:00:48 and thanks everyone for joining us today
1:00:50 too thank you yeah if you have any
1:00:53 further questions uh you can find me on
1:00:55 LinkedIn just reach out there we need to
1:00:57 follow you cuz we want to know what you
1:00:59 will work on so yeah okay well bye
1:01:02 everyone bye than
