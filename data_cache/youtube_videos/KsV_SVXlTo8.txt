0:00 this week we will talk about Indie
0:01 hacking and we have a special guest
0:03 today Pauline
0:05 Pauline is a data science manager and a
0:07 consultant at ABM IBM where she has
0:10 worked for eight years she's also an
0:13 indie hiker and is working on a few side
0:14 hustles in crypto and generative Ai and
0:17 one of her latest projects I'll also
0:19 upload in a few selfies and it generates
0:21 a lot of cool and stylists stylish
0:24 pictures and I use this service too
0:27 um so welcome Pauline hi
0:30 and I I'm glad to be invited here I
0:34 don't see anyone but uh I guess there's
0:36 some people yeah let me just
0:39 open
0:40 um I'll open YouTube from my phone so I
0:43 make sure I don't miss any questions so
0:45 today I didn't create a slider link
0:48 um because we were late and I was
0:50 struggling with um
0:53 I was struggling with zoom so today you
0:56 put all the questions if you have any
0:58 questions during today's conversation
0:59 please put them in the live chat and
1:01 that will be
1:02 covering these questions
1:04 and also the questions for today is
1:06 interview were prepared by Johanna buyer
1:09 thanks Johanna for your help and now
1:12 let's start before we go into our main
1:14 topic of Indie hacking let's start with
1:16 your background can you tell us about
1:18 your career Journey so far
1:20 so I
1:21 as an engineer and when I I studied
1:25 engineer at school but at this time
1:28 eight years ago data science was very
1:31 new so there wasn't any curses about it
1:35 just one in France actually but I wasn't
1:38 in this school and so well I applied to
1:42 IBM because it was my dream to work
1:45 there and uh well it was a match I was
1:49 accepted so I studied as a junior that I
1:53 sent this but as I didn't learn it
1:55 before because there wasn't any lotion
1:58 I I learned by myself and then I became
2:03 a senior consultant in that Essence two
2:06 years later and it's been
2:09 um yeah three or four years I'm a
2:11 manager now
2:13 and the side of this I am an ND I care
2:17 from my beginning this this year uh it's
2:21 been a year actually more or less
2:23 exactly one year and uh yeah but we will
2:26 tell more about it in this interview
2:30 okay so your first job after good dating
2:32 was IBM until you're still at IBM
2:36 yes that's that's very impressive like
2:39 people usually don't stick around for
2:41 that long at one company
2:44 uh yes I know you must like your job
2:47 like you must like it a lot yes it's I I
2:50 like it indeed
2:53 so what do you do as a data consultant
2:55 at IBM
2:58 um yeah when you are a data consultant
3:00 it means uh I work in data science area
3:05 but for various clients
3:07 I work from Project to project a project
3:11 is a mission it can be it can last one
3:14 month or four years for example I think
3:18 my shortest Mission lasted one month and
3:22 the the longer one uh two years so it
3:26 really depends and I see various clients
3:30 various domain I'm not specialized in
3:33 business in a special this business so I
3:37 work in
3:39 um Banks
3:41 aerospatial automotive and also on
3:45 different data scene context which can
3:48 be like a predict sales or
3:51 explainability models so yeah it's a
3:55 whole uh yeah I'm not specialized and
3:59 it's your choice actually
4:01 so the way it works is a customer
4:04 approaches IBM says hey I have this kind
4:07 of project uh give us some people to
4:10 work on these projects and you uh along
4:13 with your team you join the client and
4:15 you work with them on a particular
4:17 project right yes exactly yeah usually I
4:20 have I am I'm working on a team and
4:23 um uh there is like uh two or four data
4:27 senses I'm working with and I'm more in
4:30 the managing part now but I can also do
4:32 the models and help by by coding usually
4:36 in Python most of the time
4:39 what do you do as a managing partner
4:41 what kind of responsibilities do you
4:43 have I'm not a partner but uh
4:47 yeah Management Consultant right or yeah
4:50 yes as manager you like you ensure that
4:54 the models are created that it fits the
4:57 clients needs uh you also uh are you are
5:01 also the relation between the clients
5:04 and the team
5:06 um like I can present the results
5:10 um what what we achieved what is in the
5:13 roadmap uh that kind of
5:15 of tasks
5:17 okay yeah interesting and I don't know
5:21 if you can discuss that but maybe if you
5:23 can
5:24 um what are some interesting projects
5:27 that you worked on at IBM
5:30 yes
5:32 um I I won't name the clients but uh I
5:36 worked for two years to detect some
5:38 laundry Murray and uh
5:42 laundry money yeah money laundering okay
5:45 yeah oh yes sorry I know it's so
5:49 but uh yeah and it was very interesting
5:52 because I had to sing as a person that
5:56 can do money laundering and um so I I
6:00 have the like okay okay I have this data
6:04 what can I do and I was uh working on
6:08 two years past data so I had to build
6:11 intima not just me a Model A system to
6:16 to detect a
6:18 yeah strange behavior let's say
6:23 so how can you think as a money
6:26 launderer
6:28 uh but first there is some patterns that
6:32 are famous like I don't know you are you
6:35 do some sport bits and I say okay I
6:40 think it's a tennis match for example uh
6:42 Nadal Federer and you say Okay Nadal is
6:45 uh will win and you also bet that
6:48 Federer will win
6:50 so I did in the end you will have spent
6:53 some money on both so of course you will
6:55 lose money but the aim is not to uh for
6:59 someone we want to do money laundry he
7:01 doesn't want to earn money but to lose
7:03 the less possible
7:06 okay that's a nice strategy yeah and
7:09 what was interesting is that I I studied
7:12 uh to frame the project and I see it
7:16 until the end the deployment the
7:20 deployment part yes
7:22 okay yeah that's all quite interesting
7:25 and I want to ask more but that's not
7:28 the main topic today right so the main
7:30 topic today is what you started one year
7:31 ago as you said uh it's Indie hacking so
7:35 maybe
7:36 can you tell us what in the hiking
7:38 actually is
7:40 uh when you are bling project
7:45 sure it is
7:47 exact definition but uh it's uh to build
7:50 project and to monetize them
7:53 um so without any funding like when you
7:57 what was famous before because I think
8:00 this is a new trend
8:02 um what was famous before is you have a
8:05 project you pitch deck you do a pitch
8:07 deck and you are trying to find
8:10 investors uh to invest invest Fund in
8:13 your in your company but I won't I don't
8:18 do this I build uh with uh another
8:21 friend
8:23 we are free actually but two of us build
8:25 it and the other one help us with
8:28 administrative
8:29 and Lego and
8:32 um and yes we build this at our on our
8:36 free time so
8:39 it's we don't have any pressure we don't
8:42 uh we launch when we can like we start
8:46 we wanted to launch something this week
8:48 but it will be delayed let's see it's
8:51 okay we don't have any pressure nobody
8:53 knows about it so yeah that's uh by
8:56 definition
8:57 so basically during uh day time you work
9:01 at IBM as a manager data science manager
9:04 but after work after I know 5 PM or 6 PM
9:07 you start
9:09 you work on your side projects
9:12 yes exactly and during weekend most
9:15 during weekend and it was great because
9:18 in December I had a lot of holidays so I
9:21 could have I worked a lot on my project
9:24 yeah I know in France you get a lot of
9:27 holidays right a lot of vacation days
9:29 uh yes we are quite a lot yeah so that's
9:32 a good country for Indie hacking right
9:33 yes so indeed I guess means independent
9:38 right so that's the part that you said
9:40 that you don't get any funding from
9:42 anyone you just start working on a
9:45 project and then you see what happens
9:47 and the goal that we have is monetizing
9:49 this project earning money with this
9:51 project yes exactly it doesn't cost a
9:54 lot it just servers but we don't need
9:57 funding
9:59 why why hacking why hacking though so
10:02 Indie is independent but why hacking why
10:04 not just in the uh I don't know projects
10:07 or Indie work or
10:09 yeah he's more attractive for what I'm
10:11 not the one who invented this Fork to be
10:14 honest I I revealed it I don't know some
10:18 people say Indie maker some others say
10:22 bootstrappers so there are different
10:24 synonyms and uh well I don't know but uh
10:28 I use it
10:30 um some time ago I was into games and in
10:33 games there was also this concept of
10:35 Hindi
10:36 developers so usually there is a like
10:39 when you have a game then you work with
10:42 some sort of a publisher right so who
10:44 then promotes the game distributes it
10:47 right but there are some indie
10:48 developers who don't rely on these
10:50 Publishers on this network so they just
10:52 create a game and then they use their
10:54 own channels for distribution I guess uh
10:57 it's kind of a similar idea but here
10:59 like instead of finding you have
11:02 independent channels right yes
11:06 okay and tell us about your projects
11:09 that you do as a part of your
11:12 Indie hacking
11:16 played with um cryptopy that it's my
11:19 first project actually crypto P was at
11:23 the very beginning it was uh me I was um
11:26 I did some trading of crypto and I I
11:32 noticed some patterns uh in charts and I
11:36 was like okay uh that could be great to
11:39 automate some things that could be could
11:41 tell me whenever a crypto uh reacts in
11:46 some way I was trading with technical
11:49 indicators
11:50 and uh so at this time it was I think
11:54 five years ago I I had I hadn't very
11:58 much
11:59 development skills
12:01 so it was two years ago I during the
12:05 covet
12:06 um
12:07 we couldn't uh we we were allowed to
12:10 travel in France but uh we had to be
12:14 there on night at home it was I think
12:16 it's called ceasefire in English not
12:19 sure yeah curfew now yeah I think it's
12:23 very few so yes and I I visited some
12:27 friends and one of uh them is developer
12:30 so I I told her hey do you want to work
12:34 with me on this project
12:36 because it it really took a lot of time
12:39 to trade and uh she said yes so we built
12:43 our own solution to to be alerted
12:46 whenever a crypto matches our strategy
12:50 strategy and um we used it we also
12:54 automatic automated some parts to trade
12:57 but we used it for a year and it was
13:01 very profitable and so I thought okay
13:04 it's uh great for us so maybe we can
13:07 also offer it to others
13:10 so we launched a an offer of alerting
13:15 uh in crypto yeah it was in September
13:19 that we launched the offer okay so first
13:22 you use it for your own
13:24 um only for yourself right so you use it
13:26 for training trading crypto and it
13:29 wasn't public right so just you and your
13:31 friend uh used it but but then you
13:35 thought um it could be useful for others
13:37 too and then you made it public
13:39 exactly we we used it privately and uh
13:43 but the company was created in January
13:47 of last year uh but in September we
13:50 launched the offer
13:52 um and uh
13:54 and it wasn't a success at all
13:57 no no no no no no no it's uh it's very
14:01 hard because this is not my audience
14:04 um
14:05 I
14:07 I don't know a lot of Traders so it's
14:11 hard to be known in this uh domain and
14:14 it's okay I mean we build it for us so
14:17 we learn from it but uh that was the
14:20 beginning and then we say okay but we
14:22 launched one of our why not launch
14:24 something else
14:26 but at least you made money with this
14:28 too anyways for for your own Trading
14:31 uh yes okay so that was useful anyways
14:34 yes
14:36 and yeah you said it wasn't successful
14:39 at the end but I'm still curious like
14:41 between the time you realized that uh
14:44 it's useful for others and the time when
14:46 you actually launched it what happened
14:49 so
14:50 um what happened
14:52 like how did it go from like what did
14:54 you do exactly
14:56 um from that moment too you said in
14:58 January you opened the company you
15:00 started the company right but then you
15:02 were doing something in uh other months
15:05 right between January and September so
15:07 what is
15:08 uh oh between January uh in January we
15:12 we created the company because it was
15:15 better for us to have money in common we
15:18 used both our system on our sides so we
15:22 had to maintain two systems which was a
15:25 bit uh time consuming and uh so we
15:28 decided to create one company in order
15:30 to join our investing money and maintain
15:34 only one solution so that's why and then
15:38 I think it was in August that we say
15:40 okay we can launch an offer and it was
15:43 very quick to transform it to
15:46 um
15:47 to a an offer because everything was
15:51 coded so we just had to do a landing
15:55 page
15:56 um and uh yeah a bit of LEGO's thing
16:00 like things like that but it wasn't it
16:03 didn't take much time
16:07 what did you use for the landing page
16:10 what did I use
16:12 maybe can you tell us what it is why do
16:15 we need a landing page like isn't just
16:17 it's enough to just create the like the
16:19 app and expect people to join
16:22 uh but but you need uh well by landing
16:26 pages of our website I mean if the app
16:29 it's not uh an app on on the mobile or
16:32 something like that so you have two
16:35 like people have to know about it so we
16:38 yes we created a landing page and I
16:40 created from scratch
16:43 I think I had on on my side because I
16:47 already built some websites so I reused
16:50 a lot and change
16:52 of course the content images
16:55 Etc but
16:56 yeah just use something like bootstrap I
16:59 guess and then put some text there and
17:01 uh like a button sign up here right
17:03 that's what the landing page is exactly
17:06 yes
17:07 okay so you did this and then you said
17:09 you also said that you needed to take
17:11 care of some legal part
17:14 so what was there what did you need to
17:16 take care of
17:18 uh yes because when you we didn't you it
17:22 was a product to monetize so you have to
17:25 take care of doing I don't know the
17:28 privacies or terms of use things like
17:32 that and uh
17:34 uh also you have to think about okay
17:38 um if I want to monetize I also need a
17:41 payment system so find it and um and uh
17:46 integrate it to our app uh yes that kind
17:49 of things
17:50 but you don't have to to think about if
17:53 you build it for only yourself
17:57 okay so this privacy policy and all
18:00 these things I guess so you you don't
18:01 want to get sued right if somebody loses
18:04 money
18:05 yes no I don't so I'm saying we are not
18:09 advice or at the first at first we
18:13 wanted to let people uh automate their
18:15 trade but uh it's legally very
18:18 complicated so we don't we just let
18:22 people uh say their strategy and they
18:25 are alerted when the crypto match their
18:29 strategy and what does your friend do
18:33 the issue also in data science or she's
18:36 a developer no she's a Java developer
18:39 Java developer okay is this what he used
18:42 for
18:43 cryptopy Java no we use the uh well we
18:49 use the python because I wanted to be
18:52 able to modify the code
18:56 and also because uh with python there is
18:59 a framework that you can use for web
19:01 development it's called flask so we used
19:05 it but uh we could also have
19:08 used Java and uh do some front with this
19:12 but this is not a technology I I know so
19:17 yes we use Python and the last there is
19:21 one feature that she did in Java
19:24 let's see
19:26 um so you both work on everything or how
19:29 do you split responsibilities between
19:30 the two of you
19:33 um so for cryptopy I think uh at first
19:36 it was equally uh for the development uh
19:40 and then when we say uh we thought about
19:43 uh doing an offer for people uh so to
19:47 launch our offer uh we split it and she
19:50 she does the development development and
19:53 I'm more in the marketing part
19:56 um and trying to find relationship
19:58 relationships Etc
20:01 mm-hmm so what what do you do in
20:03 marketing so it's I guess mainly
20:05 promoting letting people know that this
20:08 thing exists right so you said that you
20:10 had problems with this so how did you
20:12 try to approach that oh yeah for crypto
20:15 P it was very difficult I I and it was
20:18 also my very first experience because uh
20:20 as you know my real job my day job is uh
20:26 is in that Essence so it's not related
20:29 to marketing
20:31 um it can be by exploring some marketing
20:34 models but it's not the same as doing a
20:36 marketing and uh yeah so I try like to
20:39 join some Facebook groups or read it but
20:43 I was banned very quickly I said okay
20:47 this is not a good approach so I I
20:50 started Twitter also this summer so I I
20:55 I thought okay I could use Twitter to
20:58 speak to people and uh yeah so I did
21:01 this but uh very quickly we noticed that
21:04 it was very difficult to reach an
21:08 audience for crypto Traders I also
21:12 um contacted a lot of people from crypto
21:15 influencers Etc but well influencers are
21:19 very difficult to reach it's you have to
21:23 get money to
21:25 yeah but uh so we couldn't afford it but
21:30 um so yes very quickly we said okay it
21:33 will be very difficult to monetize this
21:35 offer so we leave it like that and uh
21:40 and we will start to build other
21:42 projects and that's also when I started
21:45 before we go into your second project
21:48 I'm really curious about that too maybe
21:50 you can mention how much it costs you to
21:52 maintain this thing right and so you
21:54 said you're not actively working on this
21:55 right now it's just there but I guess
21:58 it's also you have to pay for hosting
22:01 and for other things and wondering how
22:03 expensive it is to just let it run in
22:05 the background yeah it cost about about
22:08 10 euros a month
22:11 oh not that expensive
22:16 well I guess if more people start using
22:18 it it will be more expensive right
22:21 um yeah probably but not that much
22:24 because uh
22:26 yeah I'm not sure it will be very much
22:28 more costly because it doesn't use much
22:30 of data bases and yeah so I don't know
22:34 okay and I guess this is uh from what I
22:37 see uh I saw some other
22:40 ideas or some other projects in this
22:43 space of Indie hacking most of these
22:44 projects are rather small they are quite
22:47 small they are focused on a specific
22:48 problem and uh yeah is it the correct
22:52 observation
22:54 sorry most of the projects in in the
22:57 hacking space they are pretty small they
22:59 focus on a specific problem and they
23:01 they don't do much except for solving
23:03 this particular problem yes yes it's
23:06 called like a niche market and uh yeah
23:10 it's a way of
23:13 yeah what is this is the exact and uh so
23:17 you try to validate an ID so you start
23:20 with a small project if it works then
23:23 you invest more time uh to improve it
23:26 and if it doesn't you have to say okay I
23:30 exit and you start another one
23:33 so tell us about the other one you had
23:36 yeah so
23:38 I was actually in early days and I saw
23:43 um I saw dreamboof and uh also uh
23:48 someone calls levelsio and on Twitter
23:51 that explained that he built a system to
23:56 um where you can send picture of
23:59 yourself and it transform it to new
24:01 pictures
24:02 so I was wondering how he did this so I
24:06 I I made some research
24:09 and finally I told about it to my my
24:14 friends to start this and say yes let's
24:18 do the same so we don't we didn't
24:21 reinvent the wheel
24:24 but we wanted to try it and so we
24:28 launched very quickly because it's um
24:32 um
24:33 we had most of the development done so
24:38 um yeah I think we launched in a few
24:41 weeks after the ID so it was a kind of a
24:45 side of side project because
24:48 um first because we have our work and
24:52 also because we were actually working on
24:56 a Twitter tool that we I hope we will
25:00 launch very soon
25:03 okay so you said that this uh this
25:06 project it's called unreal me IO right
25:10 um so this project you sent a few
25:12 pictures of yourself and then what it
25:14 does it uses
25:16 dream Booth you said like it uses
25:18 something uh to create new pictures from
25:21 the pictures you send
25:23 yes
25:25 so and you set the first soy tweet and
25:28 then you thought okay I can do this and
25:30 then you contacted your friends who like
25:33 the idea and You released it in a couple
25:35 of weeks exactly so can I ask can you
25:38 walk us through like how did it what
25:40 exactly did you do from seeing this
25:42 between seeing this tweet and actually
25:44 releasing what what did you need to do
25:47 um okay so first we we studied and we
25:51 were wondering okay uh should we uh
25:54 start from scratch uh with dream booth
25:57 dreamboof that it's um
26:00 a library and uh a model and uh should
26:06 we use it with our own GPU because uh as
26:09 it's fine turning images it uses GPU and
26:14 it's very expensive
26:17 um so we had this choice or otherwise we
26:20 could use an app an API to uh do the
26:24 fine tuning so we choose the solution
26:27 two because we want it to be fast
26:30 and uh and uh yeah so what happened it's
26:35 uh we have this ID so we have to build a
26:39 system to do the RPA calls and uh also
26:43 to store images of the people in case
26:47 um to send it and to get the result
26:52 when the result is done we have to store
26:54 it and send the send the picture to the
26:57 persons
26:59 um and also we so we have this to do and
27:02 also to launch like talking about it in
27:08 the on Twitter mainly but uh what is fun
27:12 about it it's um
27:14 office first sales
27:18 wasn't on Twitter and we didn't launch
27:21 yet it was because I I um subscribe to a
27:26 list of Black Friday and someone saw it
27:29 I don't know how
27:31 so yeah that's fun
27:33 okay so what I just want to summarize so
27:36 first you saw the idea right so you saw
27:39 the idea that there is this algorithm
27:40 called dreambooth that takes pictures in
27:43 and then creates new pictures and then
27:45 you like the results and you wanted to
27:47 make a project like a small software as
27:50 a service project that other people can
27:52 use right then what you did because
27:57 correct me if I'm wrong that you found
28:00 an API that uses this algorithm and then
28:03 you build like your project around this
28:06 API right exactly yes
28:09 okay and then uh so I guess this is
28:12 another service that you you used right
28:14 so you you needed to pay them
28:16 exactly yes
28:18 and uh so this is something yeah this is
28:21 an API and it doesn't take care of
28:24 storing images and all that so what you
28:27 needed to build was like all these
28:29 things like getting images
28:31 um
28:32 you know from the API saving them
28:34 somewhere and then sending to the
28:36 customers right
28:38 yes exactly
28:40 okay you said your first sale came from
28:43 even before you went live so you put the
28:45 link somewhere
28:46 yes there was a list of Black Friday
28:50 Black Friday deals it was this week that
28:53 we launched so I just subscribed but I
28:56 didn't imagine someone would see it to
28:59 be honest and uh wow yeah someone saw it
29:03 okay how do you do the lounge
29:07 uh I I talk about it on on Twitter and
29:11 uh
29:12 I also use some personal media like in
29:16 on my personal Instagram or Facebook but
29:19 I think mainly or all sales came from
29:23 Twitter and also uh the Black Friday
29:26 sites because there was other sale from
29:30 this website
29:32 okay so what did he do like how did you
29:34 announce this on Twitter did you just
29:36 say okay this is uh our new cool project
29:39 go check it out or
29:41 yeah something like that and uh
29:45 so this
29:47 thing so it was done using the
29:52 using enroll me and uh
29:56 and uh yes that's pretty it
30:00 um maybe there's some better way but I'm
30:03 still learning this job
30:06 okay yeah I cannot think of a better way
30:09 probably that's the dude and you I guess
30:13 also rely on other people sharing their
30:15 pictures right
30:16 sorry you also rely on other people
30:18 sharing the results yes exactly some
30:21 people share the results you were one of
30:25 them thank you
30:27 and uh and uh yeah also I so it
30:31 displayed on the website so people other
30:34 people can have some example uh in order
30:37 to see the results
30:40 and also if they want they can ask the
30:43 user is it really working I don't know
30:45 but uh
30:47 yeah your results were pretty impressive
30:49 uh for my pictures it didn't work well
30:51 but the reason for that is because I
30:54 just when I saw that you launched this I
30:57 just took my phone I took a few selfies
30:59 from different uh backgrounds from
31:02 different angles and that was it but I
31:05 guess you used a lot of different images
31:07 right so it wasn't from one day yes I
31:10 remember when you tried your I think you
31:12 had a green shirt it was on earlier yes
31:16 you have a green shirt and AI is not
31:19 magic I mean if you send only picture
31:21 where you are like that you will be like
31:24 that from the results that's uh yeah but
31:29 it's not Magic
31:31 so what was the main challenge here for
31:34 this project
31:35 so in the previous project you said the
31:37 main challenge was reaching
31:39 um the target audience the crypto
31:41 Traders and it's not easy but what was
31:44 the main challenge here
31:46 I think the main challenge was also
31:49 customer acquisition is very hard but at
31:52 least with this project we we made some
31:55 sales not enough to be a Ramen
31:58 profitable which is a target a very
32:02 famous when you are in India King
32:07 um but um I think he has a main main
32:11 issue was to reach people and also to
32:15 get some uh not too high prices but at
32:21 the very beginning it was very difficult
32:23 because it cost I think
32:26 um it was a 15 euros
32:29 per
32:30 um fine tuning
32:33 so you add also our cost so it was a
32:37 difficult to to do some low prices and
32:42 also it's something that is not very
32:44 useful uh I mean it's fun to have a
32:47 picture of yourself in a in AI but it
32:53 can be useful I know yeah you can use it
32:55 like for professional falling in I know
32:58 some people use it for Tinder but um but
33:02 it's a nice use case so somebody
33:04 actually uses it for Tinder right so
33:07 that's what he told me yes
33:10 we have uh his testimonial on the
33:13 website sorry do you have his
33:15 testimonial on the website like okay
33:18 like I used this unreal me Tinder and I
33:22 found the love of my love exactly the
33:25 love of my life no
33:26 that's gonna be a great story I guess
33:29 yeah exactly
33:32 okay so I guess in both of these cases
33:34 reaching the target target audience was
33:37 the main problem
33:38 yes is it always the case like you built
33:41 something and uh you cannot expect that
33:43 people will just come you need to
33:46 proactively promote it yeah to
33:49 proactively yeah and this is something
33:51 that is uh
33:53 it's uh you really really see it when I
33:58 see when I made sales it's uh every time
34:01 when I
34:03 um talk about it like it doesn't happen
34:05 just like that
34:07 um and um
34:09 so yeah and also another issue is the
34:12 time of course uh I was lucky uh for
34:16 unreal me because my friend was still on
34:19 a maternity leave so she had time
34:21 because
34:23 um she was alone at home and uh
34:26 sometimes with the baby but uh
34:29 I know that sometimes she had some times
34:32 but um sometimes babies sleep right yes
34:36 exactly and when you are alone I guess
34:38 you
34:39 I'm not doing the hacking
34:41 and
34:43 um but yeah so having also
34:46 you think about a lot of features that
34:49 you can do but uh of course we are
34:52 limited in time
34:55 and what motivates you to do this like
34:58 why did you even start working on Indie
35:00 hacking because you wanted to learn more
35:03 outside of your job or what was the main
35:06 driver for you yeah I think I I enjoy
35:11 the ideation part like thinking about
35:15 things that could be done and I also
35:18 like to create so that's something that
35:22 motivates me yes and this is very
35:26 um I think it's in addition to my work
35:28 because I like my work but uh
35:32 not that you do every time the same at
35:34 your work City because it's very not
35:36 true but uh this is kind of a personal
35:39 project and I can do I can work on
35:43 whatever I want so
35:45 I think it's really interesting
35:48 does it help at your like the skills
35:51 that you acquire through these projects
35:53 through through Indie hacking
35:55 do they help you with your main job
35:58 uh actually yes because it's uh gave me
36:02 a new culture
36:05 um I
36:07 before when I was working I used my free
36:10 time free time before in the hiking I
36:15 use my free time to do whatever things
36:17 and now this free time I use it also to
36:21 know more about AI about data and uh so
36:25 I guess it's profitable for
36:28 IBM of course and
36:31 um
36:32 uh also I train myself to new skills and
36:37 I think I understand better data
36:39 engineering no because even if it's not
36:42 really the part I'm working on
36:44 I learned JCP with this
36:48 um some some part of it yes
36:52 so you learn gcp you learn data
36:55 engineering you also learn marketing and
36:57 social media marketing in particular
36:59 what else did you learn
37:02 uh what do I learn I learned that even
37:06 if you are a very good developer without
37:08 marketing you are nothing
37:11 there is also some India here that say
37:14 Just Launch before building so they do a
37:18 landing page with a newsletter and they
37:21 see if people are interested
37:24 and if they do they build and I actually
37:27 met someone who did this and uh he
37:30 evalitate he validated his ID like that
37:34 so yeah it really depends and uh
37:38 uh I forgot sorry the question at the
37:41 beginning yeah so the question was what
37:43 kind of new skills did you pick up so
37:45 PCP data engineering social media
37:47 marketing idea validation what else
37:51 I think that's also quite a lot that's
37:54 already a lot but maybe there is more
37:56 oh
37:58 probably probably yeah like you said you
38:02 already knew web development to some
38:04 extent right so when you're building the
38:06 landing pages
38:09 yes
38:10 um and also
38:12 um like At first we I built the landing
38:16 page but that's that was killai already
38:18 had and uh after when we made a few
38:22 sales we were able to build some
38:23 templates
38:25 so now uh for our next project
38:28 I can build faster because I have a very
38:32 nice template already done
38:36 because the website I did before was
38:40 kind of quick to do but they are not
38:42 very awesome at least I don't find them
38:45 beautiful but uh it's the best I did
38:49 because uh also something I learned I
38:52 think I learned about new tools
38:55 like using more Photoshop
38:59 um it's a yeah it's a tool I use a lot
39:02 but uh I'm still at the very beginning
39:05 of Learning
39:08 did you ever need to use Photoshop at
39:10 IBM
39:12 sometimes I use it for ibms okay okay so
39:15 I guess this is another useful skill you
39:17 picked up that you can use at work right
39:20 yeah but I I use it not so much for a
39:23 clients but some for internal projects
39:26 sometimes yes
39:27 okay and how do you balance your work at
39:31 IBM within the hacking because it is a
39:33 difficult
39:34 because I guess like at work like if you
39:37 work from nine to five then at the end
39:39 you might be exhausted and then uh you
39:43 have other projects to work on so how
39:45 how do you find energy to do this
39:48 I think it's like every patient I mean
39:51 uh you if I told you I love uh horsing
39:57 horses so they said education I'm not
40:00 sure about the one is it sorry I guess
40:02 yeah if I tell you I love to do horses
40:07 um
40:09 then you say okay wow that's a patient
40:11 it's great or I love dancing I do uh two
40:17 hours every two days Etc it's very
40:20 common to have hobbies like that mine is
40:24 a building project so I don't see it as
40:27 exhausting for me it's like uh
40:31 I'm I'm motivated to work on it actually
40:34 so it's not okay my work day is finished
40:37 oh I have to work again I don't see it
40:40 as a work and I actually I think it's
40:43 essential like if you want to do uh
40:46 India King in addition to your work you
40:49 have to be
40:51 passionated about it
40:53 okay so that's your hobby right that's
40:55 the it gives you energy so at the end of
40:59 the war at the end of the working day
41:01 you might be tired but you start working
41:03 on your side projects and you get energy
41:06 from this
41:07 yes
41:08 and if I don't I just
41:11 um because you don't have to write
41:19 yeah that's where the independent
41:23 um this Indie part come comes into place
41:26 right so you don't uh you don't own
41:28 anything anyone right so you because you
41:32 don't have funding you don't have
41:33 investors then nobody is pushing you to
41:36 actually work except for
41:38 only you
41:39 see I think it could be different if uh
41:42 I had a successful service used by a lot
41:46 of users probably there is some client
41:49 support and we had to we could have to
41:52 manage time but this is not our arcade
41:55 so
41:56 we'll see later for that okay and I saw
42:00 a tweet from you so there's actually it
42:02 was a reply so the the tweet that you
42:05 replied to was do you have a list of
42:07 mikra SAS ideas and you replied that of
42:10 course there are many on your list
42:13 um so maybe can you tell us first of all
42:16 what is a mikra SAS I guess software as
42:19 a service right what is this is this
42:21 what we discussed right so all these
42:23 things that you built are micro software
42:26 Services projects yeah I don't know if
42:29 the term micro is uh important or but
42:33 yeah I have a lot of ideas I have my
42:36 notion list with a to-do list but of
42:40 course I won't build them all but um
42:43 yeah what I have as an idea is to
42:47 uh
42:50 I I work on a project if it works well
42:53 that's cool I can improve it if it
42:55 doesn't I I start a new one so as I said
42:59 and now I'm working on the on some
43:03 Twitter tools to make better analytics
43:07 of your data
43:10 um says this is what I will launch uh
43:14 there will there is other on then there
43:17 are other on my list I
43:20 won't tell not because it's confidential
43:22 but because uh I don't know if I will
43:25 launch one day and uh but there is one
43:29 actually I can tell you about is a Blog
43:33 creation uh it's called about
43:37 startup.io and this is very new I do the
43:41 lunch today you will probably see your
43:43 tweets and the idea of it is um I wanted
43:47 to
43:49 interview other people that do Indie
43:52 hacking or that build some companies uh
43:57 or even if it's a small one but uh in
44:01 order to inspire people and also say
44:04 there is not only successful people it
44:08 takes time and it's okay when you start
44:11 doing the hiking you shouldn't sing okay
44:14 I will be a millionaire at the end of
44:17 the year or something like that I think
44:19 this this is not a good
44:23 a good way to sing because it's very
44:25 hard and I yes so I want to share some
44:29 story and this is something I wanted to
44:31 do for a long time so I just started
44:35 okay great looking forward to seeing
44:37 this but this is a blog post right this
44:40 is a Blog right so yeah it's a website
44:43 with a bunch of Articles it's not a
44:46 software as a service thing
44:48 exactly I'm not uh
44:51 so how can you earn money with this
44:54 or it's more like uh just fun projects
44:57 project I think it's it's fun project
44:59 but also uh there is some people uh
45:03 there are some people that uh earn money
45:05 with blogs
45:07 um there is several way it's a like
45:11 imagine you have a blogger you talk
45:13 about cars a lot so you can find sponsor
45:18 I would say okay I am a car can you
45:21 write an article about my car so that's
45:24 a way of earning money you can also
45:27 monetize
45:29 um with ads uh are also
45:34 um with a affiliation that's several
45:37 ways
45:38 I see interesting well you said you
45:41 don't want to talk about particular
45:42 ideas that you have on the list and
45:44 that's understandable but maybe you can
45:46 tell us how these ideas ended up on you
45:49 on your list like how where do you get
45:52 ideas from
45:53 yeah so sometimes I'm trying to do
45:55 something and say oh but this doesn't
45:59 work well how can I do something else
46:02 exactly like crypto P I was on my
46:06 computer looking at chart say oh this
46:08 take me too much time how can I reduce
46:11 this time so I Google it and I didn't
46:14 find any solution to fix my problem so I
46:19 said okay it doesn't exist I will build
46:23 because I have the skills also because
46:25 uh I mean if I don't like the the bread
46:30 in my city I I won't create my friend
46:36 let's see so it mainly comes from your
46:40 frustrations or from the uh limits
46:43 limitations of other tools so there is a
46:46 tool that solves a problem but it
46:48 doesn't solve it in a way that you want
46:50 and you see okay like there's it's
46:53 possible to make it better and you take
46:56 this idea down you taken out of this yes
46:59 exactly that's exactly what we did the
47:02 exception is for unreal me it was really
47:05 just because uh
47:07 we saw other competitors that validated
47:11 the ID and say okay maybe we can earn a
47:13 few money with it so that was different
47:17 okay so what are your plans what do you
47:19 so you said you are about to launch this
47:23 about startup.io today right then you
47:26 have a Twitter Analytics tool yeah what
47:30 else should we expect from you in the
47:33 future or you don't know yet
47:38 it depends it depends you know I also
47:43 when I because I I like to share my
47:47 results and not only hey I'm successful
47:49 but also I said you have to show a
47:52 failure you are I think I like to be
47:56 transparent and doing this there is a
47:59 one person that contacted me and say
48:02 okay about crypto P I have a crypto
48:06 audience
48:08 can you do a telegram for me when every
48:12 time I trade
48:14 my audience see what I bought outside
48:19 and so this is the kind of opportunity
48:22 that you don't expect at first but this
48:25 happened
48:29 so you
48:30 what you say is you plan to work on your
48:33 existing projects a little bit and then
48:36 maybe there are some new ideas that you
48:39 will have and maybe you will
48:41 launch them too right yes and it's I
48:45 think it's very common that you have an
48:46 ID and then you start to build it and
48:49 you say okay maybe I can do differently
48:51 and so you change your mind
48:54 and the way you do this so let's say you
48:57 have an idea on this list that you
48:59 haven't started working on yet so how do
49:03 you go from this idea on the list to
49:04 actually launching it what are the steps
49:08 I think I if I uh first of all so I I
49:11 talk with my friends and we evaluate if
49:14 there is uh really a need if there is a
49:17 lot of competitors for example then we
49:20 we don't want to build just to build
49:24 um
49:25 again except maybe foreign but because
49:27 we could build it very quickly
49:30 um so yeah we evaluate and we say okay
49:32 do I need this yes uh will other people
49:36 uh will need it probably and uh do we
49:41 have the skills to do it yes so okay we
49:44 can build it
49:48 sorry yeah please please go no that's
49:51 that's what happened also with the
49:53 Twitter truth because I so I tweet a lot
49:57 and I see that
50:00 um
50:01 is the Twitter Analytics tool is very
50:04 bad at least I don't like it it's
50:09 helpful but there is a lot of
50:11 information I can get from it so I
50:14 wanted my own tool I know some other
50:17 tool exist
50:20 um but um
50:21 they all have a different offer and
50:27 I think I offer something different at
50:30 least I I build it on my own way
50:35 see yeah interesting and yeah so since
50:39 you mentioned Twitter and you also said
50:41 correct me if I'm wrong that you started
50:45 your Twitter account in summer last year
50:48 summer
50:49 2012 right and now you recently tweeted
50:54 that you have 10 000 followers so it
50:56 means like you got 10 000 followers in
50:58 half a year right
51:00 yes exactly it's a very impressive
51:02 result so how did you do this
51:05 I think I started this in June and I had
51:08 11 followers because I had the account
51:13 for a few years but I didn't use
51:17 um Twitter before I I just I I guess one
51:20 day I subscribed and never came back and
51:23 uh yes this summer I had an interesting
51:26 conversation with someone who said who
51:29 told me about personal branding and also
51:34 um because he created some companies too
51:37 and he told me if you create one project
51:41 and you create an Instagram for this
51:43 project then you create another project
51:45 you can put in trash the audience that
51:48 you build for the first one
51:50 and I wanted a continuity the common
51:54 common things between all your projects
51:57 is you actually so I say okay
52:01 um that's true and I want to show to
52:04 people
52:05 um I want to share with people what I
52:08 what I do so I do data I do um in the
52:12 hacking so I'm talking about both and it
52:16 seems people like it so
52:19 you know otherwise they wouldn't follow
52:20 you right
52:21 sorry otherwise they will would not yeah
52:24 if they didn't like it oh or maybe the
52:27 kicker
52:29 accidentally but yeah accidentally maybe
52:33 one or two but not 10 000. I hope so
52:37 well what do you think
52:39 um people
52:40 in your posts like more possible data
52:43 science or posts about Indie hacking or
52:45 something else
52:47 I think it works better with data sense
52:50 because people can more identify to it
52:54 when I share like courses or some use
52:58 cases I know uh I got I think I got more
53:02 interaction from it
53:04 um but uh
53:06 I don't build my Twitter only
53:09 strategically so India King is an
53:13 important part of my life and I want to
53:15 share about it so I choose not to go all
53:19 in on Data and to talk about the two
53:22 subjects
53:24 and I see that there is a question from
53:25 Kevin
53:27 um the question asks if there is any way
53:30 to connect with you
53:32 so
53:34 um are your DMs in Twitter open
53:36 uh yes you can then we will have your
53:40 Twitter account
53:41 um we will have the link to your Twitter
53:43 account in the description and then you
53:45 can just contact Pauline and also you
53:49 are in the data docs Club slack right so
53:51 that's another way to contact you
53:53 yes I I had some times before uh
53:58 successfully connect because but it was
54:01 very personal it was because of my
54:03 computer better at the end I reached it
54:06 yeah you don't use slack at IBM do you
54:09 uh yes we do and that's that was exactly
54:12 the the point I thought I couldn't I
54:15 thought it was a conflict if I use slack
54:17 for other uh not IBM spaces but actually
54:22 it works so that's great good because
54:25 you recently posted uh you made a post
54:28 in general
54:30 saying Happy New Year right something
54:32 like that yes I think so yeah so thank
54:35 you Happy New Year too
54:39 okay and then um another question from
54:41 Kevin is if you know Peter levels do you
54:45 know who Peter levels is uh yeah I know
54:49 him but not personally I mean I I saw
54:52 his account here
54:54 okay what does he know
54:56 oh he do uh uh he is an aspiration he's
55:01 an India curse that builds a thing
55:03 around 70 project and a few of them
55:07 became successful and I think one of his
55:11 first uh I'm not sure if it's a first no
55:15 it's not the first successful I think
55:18 in he built one project that is called
55:21 interior AI
55:23 sorry for the English accent but it's a
55:28 website where you can generate by a some
55:31 new interior for you
55:35 carrier.interior.io set right
55:37 uh I'm not sure about the link maybe
55:40 you'll just send us the link later yeah
55:44 and uh so yeah you send a picture of
55:47 your apartment and it generates new
55:51 decorations
55:52 uh and uh so is the one I was talking uh
55:56 earlier uh I got the impression far in
56:00 realme it was the one I saw his project
56:03 was working and I said okay it works for
56:05 him why Why Not Me of arm why not me why
56:10 don't I try it so I tried it
56:13 okay cool but I wasn't as suspectful of
56:16 course but uh because yeah a big
56:19 audience and he was the first and he did
56:21 it very well so but I guess also for
56:24 uh for Peter like he maybe wasn't
56:27 successful from the first attempt
56:28 probably took a few trials before
56:30 something took off right
56:33 yeah yes he shared at least recently I
56:37 think it was 70 projects that he did and
56:41 I think he make a living of
56:44 far of them maybe five I don't know
56:48 okay so if you shoot many other arrows
56:50 then a couple of them will hit the
56:52 target right
56:53 if sorry if you shoot a lot of Errors to
56:57 your target then a few of them probably
56:59 will hit it even if you're a bet Archer
57:02 I think the more you build the more uh
57:09 do you have any book or other resource
57:12 that you can recommend to the listeners
57:17 um
57:18 about data there is a two words data
57:21 sense that I really love
57:24 um because it's uh it's a Blog where
57:27 they share a lot of use case of data uh
57:30 something I read really frequently and
57:33 but I don't read much so I don't have a
57:37 lot of books yet to recommend
57:39 and like if you want inspiration about
57:43 India king of course about startup.io is
57:47 very cool okay so that's the resource
57:51 you recommend to check
57:54 um because I guess for when we will
57:56 release this recording as a podcast
58:00 about startup.io will already be live so
58:04 we will also include the link in the
58:05 description so that's the resource you
58:07 should go to if you want to learn more
58:10 about Indie hacking
58:11 cool
58:13 um
58:14 anything else you wanted to talk about
58:15 but we forgot to mention
58:19 I think we we
58:24 okay
58:25 I guess we should be wrapping up so
