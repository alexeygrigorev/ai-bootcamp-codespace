2:03 special guest today michio
2:05 and
2:06 actually michio was my
2:08 teacher
2:09 five six years ago so i was studying the
2:12 tube berlin
2:13 doing my masters
2:14 and michael was one of the teachers of
2:17 the machine learning class i was very
2:19 lucky because
2:21 after that year michiel left academia
2:24 and joined industry so i was actually i
2:26 was able to
2:28 um
2:29 to witness his teaching because
2:31 otherwise if i joined maybe if i started
2:33 my master's
2:35 one years one year later then
2:38 yeah
2:39 and so mickey joined zelanda after
2:42 working at tieberlin
2:45 you worked there as a
2:46 like in many different roles yes
2:49 principal role and uh yeah so we spent
2:53 quite a few years there right like four
2:55 and a half years yeah
2:56 and then you joined get your guide he
2:58 also worked for some time there
3:00 and right now michio is working as a
3:03 consultant so he consults companies on
3:05 how to make the best use of machine
3:07 learning looking on the whole picture
3:10 from technical infrastructure to product
3:11 development yeah welcome
3:14 hello yeah thanks for
3:16 having invited me thanks for the kind
3:19 kind words about my teaching
3:21 it was really great i really
3:23 i remember that it was like sixth or
3:25 seventh uh lecture of machine learning
3:27 so the professor mulder was
3:30 i think he had a business trip uh and
3:32 then uh you were a replacement so you
3:34 came into the class
3:36 you look at the topic and you said
3:38 linear regression sixth lesson seriously
3:41 yes
3:42 i can't remember
3:45 i think that
3:46 also did like a practical course on big
3:47 data i think yeah and that was the the
3:50 second semester the winter semester yeah
3:52 yeah
3:53 yeah that was fun
3:54 so i did
3:56 talk a bit about your career already
3:58 yeah but maybe before we start
4:02 with our main topic you can also
4:05 tell us a bit about your career journey
4:07 so far
4:08 yeah no the yeah originally i wanted to
4:11 become a professor so i was a researcher
4:13 right and then the only way
4:16 the only goal you have is to become a
4:17 professor so i was
4:19 writing papers um
4:21 supervising phd students uh
4:24 you know doing the whole conferences so
4:26 i think i went to new rips like for five
4:28 or six times
4:31 um
4:32 yeah but the so i think so you know
4:35 originally i started computer i studied
4:37 computer science
4:38 so i also always wanted to build
4:40 something and then at some point it
4:41 became like writing these papers and so
4:43 on became less and less
4:45 uh
4:46 fulfilling i would say and also it's
4:48 really hard right so these conferences
4:50 acceptance rates of less than 20 so you
4:52 do a lot of work which never which is
4:54 never published so this bomb boost was
4:56 was it ever accepted
4:58 i don't think so now
4:59 how many times did you try to submit it
5:03 uh i don't know like two or three times
5:06 maybe yeah that was a nice nice
5:08 algorithm yeah but somehow
5:10 yeah at least so there's one guy who
5:11 wrote his master thesis uh trying to
5:13 parallelize it on a gpu so it wasn't
5:16 at least at least so it was good for
5:18 something
5:20 yeah and then um
5:22 yeah at the end then i had this the
5:23 stream stream little primpact like
5:26 project mini startup on the side
5:29 uh which we did which i did for quite a
5:30 few years
5:32 and that also
5:33 exposed me you know we did like pilots
5:35 with some companies to this world and
5:37 then the funny thing is if you're inside
5:38 the university
5:39 you always think yeah everybody tells
5:41 you like this is the best place to be
5:43 and then you start working with people
5:44 and think oh this is also interesting
5:46 yeah
5:47 so then yeah i went to zolando and um
5:50 which was also yeah and then i really
5:52 learned a lot
5:53 yeah so
5:54 and then but i sort of continued trying
5:56 all these different so i started as an
5:58 engineering manager and then they
6:00 started having this principle role right
6:02 so i thought okay
6:05 no going back to be more technical and
6:06 so on so i
6:08 looked for new opportunities to learn
6:10 something all the time
6:12 and so eventually you ended up being a
6:15 solo consultant right yes yeah so what
6:18 do you help with so what do you consult
6:20 about
6:21 um
6:22 yeah so i think the the idea was that i
6:25 help companies
6:27 in general if they want to do like
6:29 machine learning and production or in
6:30 practice
6:32 not just production and the because i i
6:34 worked on so many different aspects
6:36 right so i created algorithms
6:38 as a researcher myself
6:40 and then i had teams organized and then
6:42 later on i did like worked on a machine
6:45 learning platform team at zelano or a
6:47 project as a like a consulting architect
6:50 and also this this consulting role at
6:52 the london or the principal role was a
6:54 bit like internal consulting right so
6:56 i think so the idea was that i
6:58 i
7:00 my problem is that i always start with a
7:02 technical problem but then i always
7:04 wonder like what is the what is the real
7:06 problem and then you end up looking into
7:07 organization and things like that
7:09 so to take all that and then um yeah try
7:12 and help companies become better at that
7:14 whatever it is right so that was the
7:16 original idea
7:18 so you're like a principal uh
7:21 data science or machine learning person
7:23 to her right yes yeah
7:25 right and the so one one decision or i
7:28 made early on is that i wouldn't i
7:30 wouldn't be hands on myself right so
7:32 because i think
7:33 um
7:34 so mainly because it's a very different
7:36 kind of work so if you're like really
7:38 doing data analysis yourself then
7:41 it's more like you
7:42 uh like but you really have to put on a
7:45 lot of hours so the idea was i'm more on
7:47 the mentoring side and then i can also
7:49 do a couple of projects in parallel and
7:51 so on
7:52 so
7:53 how does it work out for you
7:55 uh so far it's uh it's good it's very no
7:58 it's the so the funny thing was
8:00 actually i thought okay maybe
8:02 so i decided i want to try this
8:05 and then i quit my job at get your guide
8:07 um
8:08 and then i thought
8:09 okay maybe i need to first you know
8:11 write a lot of blog posts and start you
8:14 know doing
8:16 promotions like this yes promoting
8:18 uh and then i don't know maybe so two
8:20 three months or something i thought and
8:21 then it would take some time but then
8:23 the funny thing is that sort of um
8:26 yeah i immediately got my first project
8:29 right and that's um
8:32 yeah and then another one so it actually
8:34 was i didn't
8:35 so i stopped i stopped sort of stopped
8:37 working and then there was a weekend and
8:38 then i started on my on my new job like
8:41 on the new consulting gig
8:42 and there was there wasn't any time
8:44 between it this was quite yeah it was a
8:45 bit surprising so was it did you
8:48 at least write something on linkedin and
8:50 this is how you found a client or
8:56 so i started in
8:57 november
8:59 right and the so how i got my first
9:01 project was um so just people that i
9:04 knew
9:04 from my time at the london who now was
9:06 were somewhere else and then
9:08 right they knew that that i quit and
9:09 then they asked oh so what are you doing
9:11 now
9:12 um
9:14 and then
9:16 and i think this is pretty common also
9:17 right people ask why don't you join our
9:19 team or
9:20 why don't you come to us uh and then i
9:23 said no but you know i wanted to try
9:24 this consulting thing for a while and
9:26 then a few of them actually said okay if
9:27 you want to do consulting we can we can
9:29 try that right and that's sort of how i
9:31 got into it and it was it was quite
9:34 uh yeah so in retrospect right i think
9:38 it's not that surprising because i i
9:40 really knew like a lot of people or the
9:42 good thing if you're at the company at
9:43 the london is you have you not get to
9:45 know a lot of people and then they move
9:46 on so you have
9:48 like a good good network already and
9:51 then everybody's looking for i mean data
9:53 scientists are still
9:55 um very hard to find so everybody's
9:56 trying to find somebody and i think that
9:58 that's
9:59 pretty easy i mean i think it's it's
10:02 something it's not
10:04 yeah
10:05 it's not as hard as as you think maybe
10:07 yeah
10:08 okay so it's not as hard as you think if
10:10 you have a strong network right yes yeah
10:13 so that was i think is key yes but but i
10:15 think so talking to other consultants um
10:17 [Music]
10:20 it's also not uncommon right so you
10:22 you do this project with one so many
10:25 um
10:27 yeah many people so you do one project
10:29 which is which works well and then
10:31 somebody recommends you and things like
10:33 that right so it's not like you
10:35 uh you build a great website and then
10:37 you sell it and then people come but
10:38 because consulting is also a lot but i
10:40 think with trust and then you need some
10:42 people who
10:43 yeah you need to
10:44 but it's always better if somebody said
10:46 i did the project with him it was good
10:47 great and then uh you know that's the
10:51 i think it's not uncommon that it works
10:52 like this
10:53 so this is how it happened to you so
10:55 first you found the first client uh
10:58 through your network of somebody who
11:00 also works with you in zlanda so you
11:03 found
11:05 them or they found you so you worked for
11:07 them and then they basically recommended
11:09 you to somebody else and this is how
11:11 it started right yes i mean i think they
11:14 didn't recommend me but then there were
11:15 a few of these these things right so and
11:18 then and then this sort of became the
11:20 first few
11:21 few projects um
11:22 yeah and then in january
11:24 i i posted on linkedin but i'm doing
11:27 this now
11:28 and and i think these career change
11:30 things on linkedin they they always get
11:32 a lot of engagement right
11:34 i mean also usually it's people saying
11:36 i'm working at a new company and then
11:37 everybody says yeah great all the best
11:40 but then on linkedin everybody i mean
11:42 liking is like like retweeting right so
11:44 it's shared quite widely yes
11:48 also if you update your profile i think
11:50 everyone in your network gets like a
11:52 notification yeah
11:54 yeah
11:55 and that led to quite a few talks but i
11:58 think no no new project at that time
12:00 yeah
12:02 but then yeah what i what i started also
12:04 doing is then like lots of i mean i gave
12:06 the talk here right but i
12:08 did a
12:09 few couple of podcasts and um
12:13 yes and then through that
12:14 so i think this so this summer for some
12:17 i don't know what the why why this
12:18 summer but i got i got it again like a
12:21 large number of um another large number
12:23 but like a
12:24 okay number of new new inquiries and
12:27 then yeah
12:28 but okay you mean more than you can
12:30 handle
12:31 yeah actually so that's the fire i think
12:33 it was pretty
12:35 so workload wise it was pretty okay but
12:37 but currently so now i have to i have to
12:39 sort of think like okay what is how
12:42 actually what
12:42 like what kind of projects do i want to
12:44 do and so on
12:46 so now you have projects to choose from
12:48 um
12:49 yes maybe
12:51 i think that's the other thing and
12:53 uh
12:54 actually i mean this is i think a great
12:56 thing about freelancing um
12:59 is is that you actually have this
13:00 freedom right so you can you can just
13:02 you can say you can say okay i want to
13:04 do this you can think about it and if
13:06 something is not working or you think
13:08 you're struggling you can think about it
13:09 and then say okay maybe i try to do a
13:11 different kind of project and so on
13:13 uh and this was also pretty
13:15 constant right so it
13:17 actually was
13:19 right so you're in the beginning i was
13:20 like okay this will take a few months
13:21 till it till i have any income again
13:24 right and then suddenly it's okay and
13:26 then
13:26 and you want but what if this stops and
13:28 then at some point for some reason you
13:30 have two men too many projects so it's
13:32 uh yeah that's
13:34 not very stable i'd say yeah so a lot
13:36 more things to worry about compared to
13:38 usual full-time job right yeah
13:41 so how how do you usually find clients
13:44 or do they find you or what's yeah
13:47 yeah no that's the
13:49 they
13:50 they find me like me so far
13:52 um
13:53 yeah i think i did as i said right i did
13:55 a bit of a bit of marketing here um
13:59 yeah then i think usually what you do is
14:01 so the question is then
14:03 um
14:05 yeah i mean what do you do then right so
14:07 it's like this
14:10 like the first first meeting um just to
14:12 try to understand what they need and so
14:14 on yeah so
14:18 yeah so basically to find clients what
14:20 you need is uh well first have a good
14:22 network right yeah then also you need to
14:25 do to give a couple of talks so people
14:28 know you exist those who are
14:30 let's say outside of your network
14:32 immediate network yeah and then uh
14:34 that's enough to actually get started
14:36 right and then the word of mouth uh
14:38 helps to land new clients
14:41 yeah and i think i mean it's also it's
14:44 so i've been thinking also a lot about
14:46 this but i think it's actually quite
14:47 it's much more easy to start a new like
14:50 a startup or something right because
14:51 usually like if you have one or two
14:53 projects
14:54 then then you you're already making
14:56 enough money or like it's
14:58 it's not like you have to bootstrap for
15:00 two years and not make any money right
15:02 um
15:03 yeah so it's the tradition i think was
15:06 smoother than i thought yeah
15:09 and i think once you have that right so
15:10 you also have a bit of time and um
15:14 to see how it goes yeah and i mean often
15:17 it's also like the
15:18 yeah
15:19 so i mean if it's also if you have a
15:20 good client it works well there's also
15:22 the chance that they will extend the
15:23 project and so on
15:27 yeah so
15:28 i want to ask you a few things so maybe
15:30 let's first start with the network thing
15:32 so yeah
15:33 you said it wasn't too difficult for you
15:35 but one of the reasons was that you had
15:37 a good network and by the way there is a
15:39 message from felix miller saying hey
15:42 greetings from one of those excellent
15:44 colleagues
15:45 yes
15:46 so tell uh
15:48 so um
15:49 for people who want to um start
15:52 freelancing so how do they build such a
15:54 network so they
15:56 later let's say if they want to start
15:57 freelancing half a year or a year so how
16:00 do they approach this uh whole network
16:02 building thing yeah
16:04 i think anyone is sort of in the company
16:06 just where you are having a good network
16:10 uh right i mean so it's just
16:12 uh
16:13 i i don't know i don't for me i don't so
16:16 i
16:16 i think it's not it's quite natural to
16:20 hang out by the water cooler yes
16:23 i mean so sometimes need for coffee
16:25 like not just in your team but maybe
16:27 there's somebody else another you're on
16:28 the project and then you also just
16:31 you say like okay maybe we can have
16:32 lunch together and coffee just to get to
16:34 know each other a bit right and then i
16:36 think if you stay longer you also move
16:37 around a bit and then
16:39 um
16:40 so good is also i think always asking
16:42 people you know whether they know
16:43 somebody
16:45 right so if you
16:47 and then they introduce you to them
16:49 and then i think you can have this um
16:52 like this one hour so there's like a
16:54 typical networking one-hour meeting
16:57 right so
16:58 not sure whether whether people are
16:59 aware so
17:00 um
17:02 we should talk a bit about that so how
17:05 that works
17:06 i work with it
17:09 right so the question for somebody yes
17:11 yes so like
17:12 let's say if in half a year i want to
17:15 freelance and they want to build a
17:16 strong network and even if i don't
17:18 freelance at the end i think this
17:19 network will help anyway so how do i how
17:22 do i do this so you said uh have one
17:25 hour
17:26 uh meetings
17:28 okay the first is i think you have to
17:29 sort of find people and i think you can
17:32 sort of ask people in your network
17:33 whether they know somebody who's
17:35 interesting i think you can also like on
17:37 on linkedin or on twitter if you see an
17:39 interesting post you can also just
17:41 connect with people and say oh this is
17:42 interesting maybe you can have a meeting
17:44 so i'm also getting requests like this
17:46 um there's like an app which is called
17:49 lunch club where you can register and
17:51 then
17:52 put in like a bit of your
17:55 like what you're interested in and then
17:56 each week you get matched with somebody
18:00 um
18:01 yeah i think these and then i mean there
18:02 are these things like you can go to
18:03 meetups and then just talk to people and
18:06 so on and i think sort of the key thing
18:08 so that first to get the contact and
18:10 then
18:11 so what you do with these people is so
18:12 you meet for one hour and
18:14 for me it seems like there's always the
18:15 structure right so usually it's like
18:17 everybody does an intro about themselves
18:18 so you just and you sort of say okay you
18:21 want to say something about yourself or
18:22 should i start
18:23 and then everybody tells a little bit
18:25 about like like their history what
18:27 they're interested in
18:28 and then that takes like half an hour
18:30 and then usually in that time if if
18:32 you've seen some common things right you
18:33 just go a bit deeper into these topics
18:35 and you just talk and then and then
18:37 after an hour you're sort of done right
18:39 but then there's this connection there
18:41 and then later on um you maybe remember
18:44 some people or something like that
18:47 and that's i think that's
18:48 so if you do this for a while right then
18:50 a lot of people you get to know some
18:52 people and people know you and so on
18:54 so you said lunch club and then also
18:57 linkedin
18:58 meetups i guess now with meetups it's a
19:00 bit more difficult yeah
19:01 yeah
19:02 but i think it's it's totally okay on
19:04 linkedin if you
19:05 um if you see a post you know just make
19:08 a uh connect request and then just say
19:11 oh this looks interesting if you want
19:13 let me just ask people right they can
19:14 always say no and not get back to you
19:16 but um
19:17 i think usually it's quite
19:19 it's quite
19:21 more open to this than maybe you think
19:23 yeah
19:24 yeah thanks and then other thing you
19:26 said
19:27 so now you get a client and uh so
19:31 what is interesting is what next happens
19:33 next week first you have this
19:35 sort of intro call right you try to
19:37 figure out uh
19:39 like if you're a good match if you can
19:40 help the client right or how does it
19:43 look like so
19:44 so let's say you get a linkedin message
19:46 saying hey mickey i heard you're doing
19:48 freelancing can you help us so what
19:50 happens after that yeah
19:52 i think there are a few things i think
19:54 you have like this intro so you have the
19:56 number of calls right so usually but
19:58 it's one and then
19:59 maybe maybe i'm doing this wrong right
20:01 but sometimes they say oh you also need
20:03 to meet these people before we make the
20:05 decision
20:06 and then sometimes it's quite a few
20:07 meetings i mean which for which you
20:08 don't get any money right but that's so
20:10 you don't i was going to ask that if you
20:13 build that
20:15 no i think the
20:16 um
20:18 so the idea is more right so you try to
20:20 build some trust or can you see whether
20:22 it would actually make sense
20:24 um right so you don't want to solve the
20:27 problems already right but then the i
20:29 mean the idea is so if if you get a
20:30 client then this would be like a longer
20:33 few weeks maybe a few months project
20:35 for usually
20:37 quite quite a lot of money so
20:40 so it's like this this is like the kind
20:42 of unpaid marketing that you have to do
20:44 right yes i mean that was actually so
20:46 when i when i started it was a bit funny
20:48 because i had these projects and people
20:51 because of it's more mentoring right i'm
20:52 not like working full days or so right
20:54 so it's more like a few meetings here
20:55 and there
20:57 but then over time i realized that all
20:59 this other work is also work right it's
21:01 just that you don't get money for it but
21:02 if you think about it right so i mean
21:04 most of the work is not work that that
21:07 actually makes money for the company
21:09 right so every
21:10 so it's very indirect
21:13 if you're a developer right it's not
21:14 like people actually like a customer
21:16 gives you money to write a single night
21:18 of code but it's sort of i don't know
21:20 you know
21:21 yes yes um yeah i think
21:24 one question is right sort of you have i
21:26 think you should have an idea like what
21:27 kind of work you want to do right
21:29 whether it's
21:30 if you freelance whether it's really
21:32 like you you want to be hands-on and
21:33 code or not and then figure out how that
21:35 works yeah
21:37 and i think the interesting question is
21:39 really to understand so sometimes they
21:40 have an idea like what what they want
21:43 right but i think it's also important to
21:44 understand actually what their problem
21:46 is so
21:47 it's like what they want and what they
21:48 need yes and not because they already
21:50 might sometimes say are you you're
21:52 looking for somebody who does this and
21:53 that but that's already the solution
21:55 part and then
21:57 the question is why do they want that
21:58 and so on yeah like we need like an
22:01 expert in deep learning
22:03 but why and then you start digging uh
22:06 yes and it turns out that maybe this
22:08 logistic regression would solve the
22:09 problem
22:12 lecture number six as you said right so
22:14 yeah
22:16 exactly yes
22:17 yeah and then what i would try to do so
22:18 there's one book that somebody
22:20 recommended to me which is a very funny
22:22 title and that's called um
22:24 what it's called million dollar
22:26 consulting
22:28 uh by um i think ellen weiss is the guy
22:31 uh well so the i mean i think it's a
22:33 good book so i'm not sure whether you
22:35 can take this and then make a million
22:36 dollars consulting
22:38 i was
22:46 like a template for the offer which
22:48 which i found to be quite good so you so
22:50 what i found is good is if you actually
22:52 take the time and then sort of write
22:54 down a summary of what you understood
22:56 what the problem is they want to solve
22:58 and like what you what you want to what
23:00 you're offering and then you can also
23:02 talk about like your fees or so on
23:04 and i found that the
23:06 so every time i do this is actually
23:08 quite quite insightful also right it's
23:10 also good for them to check whether you
23:12 really have the same understanding so
23:14 sometimes it's like they say okay when
23:15 can you start and then it never gets
23:17 really explicitly written down like what
23:18 it is yeah okay so basically the outcome
23:21 of this
23:22 one or a couple of initial meetings is
23:24 to understand if you can help them and
23:27 if you need them what what actually they
23:29 need so then you write some sort of
23:31 somebody and you also need to decide on
23:34 your hourly rate and then you send them
23:36 this email and then
23:37 they either agree or not right yes yeah
23:40 you can also go do it in a google doc
23:42 and then you can actually have them
23:44 comment it right and then then discuss
23:46 so really discuss it a little bit
23:48 um
23:49 yeah
23:51 and
23:52 yeah and we already have a question uh
23:54 from here
23:55 is how to
23:57 decide on this rate
24:03 we is some prior chats about this and
24:05 you also mentioned something about like
24:07 there is a trade-off between uh when you
24:10 play per day or per hour or per project
24:12 so maybe you can also talk about uh yeah
24:15 yeah that's a big so first i should say
24:17 that people tell me i'm really bad at
24:18 negotiating no probably if you're a
24:21 future client you shouldn't know that
24:22 but
24:24 so i think the the so the natural thing
24:26 is to start just with an hourly rate
24:28 because it's very transparent right you
24:30 say
24:31 i work for you you you
24:34 some somewhere so i have like google
24:36 sheets where i put in all the hours and
24:37 then at the end of the month you write
24:39 an invoice
24:41 um
24:42 but i found that the so the downside of
24:45 that is is that that this is a very
24:48 strange incentive for you right
24:50 so the if so actually if you want to so
24:52 i think in some way it would be great if
24:54 you get get more money
24:56 if you help the client and not if you
24:58 just work more hours right and sometimes
25:00 so i'm more like okay if it doesn't make
25:02 any sense i also don't work more hours
25:04 and then suddenly you realize you're
25:05 actually not
25:06 working as many hours as you thought you
25:08 would with something right because for
25:10 whatever reason because it's it's easier
25:12 or the project was moving faster than
25:14 you thought or people don't need that
25:15 much help
25:16 and so on so that's
25:18 yeah so i think the but but then again
25:20 if you go for the other rate so the
25:22 question is how do you come come up with
25:23 this break right
25:25 yes exactly
25:27 and in the book million dollar
25:28 consulting so what he he proposes is
25:30 that you you sort of try to talk about
25:32 what is the value of the work that
25:34 you're doing and then you say right you
25:36 say so i go in
25:38 uh i do this logistic regression model
25:40 you save a hundred thousand euro
25:42 um so let's say 10 of that right or five
25:45 percent of that or something
25:48 and i think so in a way this is a good
25:50 argument i think but it's sometimes
25:52 really hard to figure out like what is
25:54 what is this money um what is the value
25:57 of the project and then the other thing
25:59 is that many people so
26:02 they they think more in terms of
26:03 salaries right so and that's sort of
26:06 could be something
26:07 right so like how do you
26:09 know that you will your project will
26:11 succeed so you're kind of beating on the
26:13 success of the project machine learning
26:15 it's not always the case
26:17 that's true no okay what it says in the
26:19 book is sort of you say okay so you
26:21 asked the client right so how much money
26:23 do you think this will make and then
26:24 they say it could be between one and two
26:26 million or something and then
26:28 and then you take the lower bound right
26:30 so you say you think it will make at
26:32 least one million and then you you sort
26:34 of you bring it down and so on yeah so
26:36 i've tried yeah it's it's
26:38 yeah it's i don't know i i i tried it i
26:41 know people who who managed to do that
26:43 but i think it's it's much tougher
26:45 discussion because also and the point is
26:47 also
26:48 so if if you want to do this you can
26:50 never talk about hourly rates right
26:52 because if you talk about hourly rates
26:53 they will always they will always try to
26:55 say like okay if this is like ten
26:57 thousand how many hours is this work and
26:58 then so you can't get away from it so
27:01 you really have to do that
27:02 um
27:04 and then the other thing is it's a very
27:05 weird thing
27:06 so sometimes when you say like okay so
27:08 it's like i don't know ten thousand euro
27:10 over three months so each month month
27:12 you pay me
27:13 like a third of it
27:15 uh or there are different versions or
27:17 you say like you paid half first and
27:19 then half at the end or something
27:21 uh but if there's like this fixed rate
27:23 then some companies or some clients i
27:25 talked to they're suddenly afraid that
27:26 this might look like uh employment right
27:29 so
27:31 so there's always this thing like if if
27:34 i don't know what the
27:35 english right but the
27:37 um
27:39 so if you're paying somebody as a
27:40 freelancer but it's actually really like
27:43 unemployment then as a company you have
27:45 to pay health insurance and i don't know
27:48 all this life insurance and stuff like
27:49 that
27:50 so and they are afraid that i don't know
27:52 there's some sort of
27:55 some
27:56 uh like this financial um uh how they
27:59 call it
28:01 like basically finance authority will
28:03 come and say hey like looks like you're
28:05 waiting taxes
28:07 yes right so you have this this guy but
28:09 i mean you're paying him like a monthly
28:11 fee which is really like uh like salary
28:14 so please you all now also have to pay
28:15 all this instrument for them yeah so
28:17 this is like the i don't know this is
28:19 the
28:19 downside right but i think the
28:22 yeah so
28:26 let's say for somebody who just wants to
28:28 start freelancing and they have no idea
28:30 about the market they don't know how
28:32 much
28:33 other freelancers make i guess that's
28:36 difficult like how do you come up with
28:38 this hourly price
28:39 you ask a client like hey how much you
28:42 want to pay me or
28:43 i guess it's difficult to yes when
28:46 you're starting to come up with a number
28:49 do you have any tips
28:51 yeah so though it's uh
28:52 yeah i know i also asked ask other
28:54 consultants like one day what they
28:57 take um i think i was lucky because the
29:00 like my first client was somebody i
29:02 worked with together previously right
29:04 and then
29:05 and then at some point he suggested that
29:06 i increase my rate like a little bit
29:11 yes um
29:13 yeah but i think you also have to i
29:14 think so one thing is if if you're
29:16 if you're sort of hands-on and work in a
29:18 lot of hours right i think it's it's uh
29:22 it's less you make per hour if it's more
29:24 like so is that so it's a bit linked to
29:27 the like the impact you're doing right
29:30 yeah
29:31 but then i think you also have to you
29:33 have to see whether it sort of feels
29:34 right for you right you can't
29:37 so in summary and there's also a
29:39 question from here is uh
29:42 you
29:43 don't have daily rate for your projects
29:45 you
29:45 know or how how do you do this now
29:48 hourly rate daily rate or per project or
29:50 it really depends on
29:56 especially like the older ones where
29:57 just having like an hourly rate i have
30:00 yeah i mean that's also the nice thing
30:02 right it's um
30:05 so you can also in the end you can set
30:07 your your prices and if you can agree on
30:09 something and that's also good right i
30:11 think the the
30:13 um so the advantage also of like a fixed
30:15 rate is also that
30:17 um
30:19 then you can really focus on on doing
30:20 like the best work like also from the
30:23 from your client side right so sometimes
30:25 they're like ah he's already so
30:26 expensive let's try to use them less or
30:28 something right so they can just
30:30 um
30:32 yeah you can just focus on it and
30:35 yeah sometimes
30:35 sometimes it's like more work sometimes
30:37 it's less work but it's it's less of a
30:39 hassle and then the okay the
30:41 the other funny thing is right so
30:42 usually with your client
30:44 um when they so they ask like if it's an
30:47 hourly rate they also ask you what the
30:49 what the
30:50 weekly estimate is because they need to
30:52 do a budget for that
30:54 right
30:55 and so actually it's um
30:57 yeah so so in a way right actually like
31:00 fixed rate doesn't really hurt them
31:01 because then it's already budgeted and
31:02 they can just spend it but it's
31:05 difficult but i think at the end of the
31:06 day you also have to ask yourself right
31:08 so what is the how many hours do i want
31:10 to work how much money do you want to
31:11 make or when does it feel okay or not
31:12 okay so yeah
31:16 i mean usually when you come out of the
31:18 so you know what you would earn as a
31:20 um
31:21 as a like employee full-time employee
31:25 and i think um
31:27 yeah that's sort of a rough
31:29 process so this is how much you aim to
31:31 make
31:32 the very least right
31:33 yes and yeah this should be a bit more
31:35 because you always have this i mean you
31:37 have to so there are things like they
31:39 have to pay more for your health
31:40 insurance because you have to cover all
31:42 of it and things like that
31:43 and you have this risk that maybe there
31:45 is in the project so you have to say so
31:47 on average so you need to think about
31:49 expected uh uh widely right yeah and
31:52 then like you know your vacations right
31:54 nobody pays for that and so on so it's
31:58 yeah
31:59 about vacations uh i know you recently
32:02 came back from a vacation so how does it
32:04 so how
32:05 i imagine that it's uh very difficult
32:08 now to take a vacation because now i
32:10 work as a full-time employee i know that
32:12 i have 28 days of vacation so you're
32:15 going to stay up okay i'm taking around
32:17 10 days 20 days
32:19 um see you there and then i get paid for
32:21 this so this is a paid vacation in case
32:23 of three months uh it's not the case
32:25 right so you need to
32:26 uh don't work you don't make money right
32:29 so it's psychologically i guess it's
32:31 very difficult to just you know pack
32:33 your things and go away for months yeah
32:36 exactly
32:38 it's that and then
32:40 yeah so i actually thought about this
32:42 and then i had the
32:43 i almost thought like oh it's actually
32:45 like i'm paying double for this right
32:46 because i'm paying for the vacation and
32:48 i'm not making money so
32:50 it's a bit like um
32:54 working from uh
32:56 like working from vacation is it
32:59 and then you don't enjoy vacation right
33:01 yeah i think there are some people who
33:02 just say i can i can go on vacation and
33:05 then i have maybe this one client and i
33:06 just i just have a few me if there's not
33:09 like a lot of meetings you can still
33:10 have them
33:11 um
33:13 yeah no but i think that that's the
33:14 point right so you that's also why you
33:16 need to factor this into a rate so you
33:18 should go for
33:19 like if i make this in 10 months per
33:21 year then i have
33:24 yeah and then i think the other thing is
33:25 of course that if you have like several
33:27 clients you might feel bad about
33:30 um
33:31 sort of not not being there for them
33:34 but then i but on the other hand i think
33:36 right so usually in this this
33:39 so you're working with people most of
33:41 the people you work with are employees
33:43 and it's pretty normal that they just go
33:45 on vacation right
33:47 and i think in the end i also have to
33:49 that's another thing right so nobody if
33:51 nobody stops you you can just work like
33:54 24 7 so you have to you have to take
33:56 some breaks
33:58 so yeah i guess it's also because now
34:01 you have let's say if you have hourly
34:03 rate you have this incentive of uh
34:06 working on all the time right yeah like
34:08 especially like let's say you can
34:11 get three clients and then work eight
34:12 hours for each right oh approximately
34:15 yeah
34:18 yeah so and then like after a week
34:21 you burn out that yes so how to to avoid
34:24 overworking do you have any tips
34:28 no no i think it's uh
34:31 now one thing i think is uh i don't know
34:33 so at least for my my products i
34:35 so because it's
34:37 yeah nice so i i honestly think it
34:39 depends on the kind of work is it yeah
34:43 so if you're if you're more under like
34:44 mentoring working with people right it's
34:46 also you can just work for eight hours
34:48 per day maybe if you have like 10
34:49 clients you can just
34:50 slice them together every day yeah
34:53 but you have to i think you have to
34:55 yeah you have to make you have to just
34:57 keep an eye on your capacity and then
35:00 also um yeah you have to find like a
35:03 balance
35:05 like what makes sense for you in terms
35:06 of money and then
35:08 also do that yeah
35:10 so as a freelancer now all of a sudden
35:12 you have a lot more things to worry
35:14 about so you need to worry about like
35:15 okay how do i
35:17 set my hourly rate because you it's not
35:19 just a number it's not like you just
35:21 take your hourly rate that you make as a
35:24 full-time employee and use it you need
35:26 to account for vacation you need to
35:27 account for i don't know sickness you
35:29 need to account for
35:30 um
35:31 like risk that there will be no client
35:34 yeah right is there any any insurances
35:37 is there any rule of thumb like you can
35:38 just maybe take your current
35:40 hourly rate and double it or triple it
35:45 not sure no i don't know
35:47 it seems quite difficult okay so you
35:50 have this problem right on top of that
35:54 you need to also
35:55 think about your mental health and in
35:57 general like how do you avoid over
36:00 overworking right like how do you
36:03 um let yourself take occasion right yes
36:06 so and uh
36:08 yeah that's uh that's what to manage
36:10 right it is now and then then there's
36:12 the other thing right so you also need
36:14 to think about like the
36:16 sort of so in a way like what consulting
36:18 is also like a product right
36:21 and um i think in the in the beginning i
36:23 also did this you're just like yeah it
36:24 sounds interesting sounds like something
36:26 i could do and then you take on a lot of
36:28 projects but so the question is also so
36:30 how do you want to is this like what you
36:32 want to do every project is different
36:34 there's also many people i talk to is
36:37 like
36:37 right so there's also this idea that you
36:39 want to um
36:41 sort of
36:42 standardize what you do a bit more and
36:45 also specialize more right so that
36:46 there's like this
36:48 there's really this one thing
36:50 um that you
36:52 i don't know right i don't know it's
36:54 like
36:55 certain kind of models like a niche
36:57 right for yeah
36:58 so yeah and i think the sort of the
37:01 um
37:03 the advantage of that is that everything
37:04 becomes a bit more predictable also
37:06 right so you or you get better at what
37:08 you do so you say okay i have this i
37:10 always do like pro i do a certain kind
37:12 of project and then every time i do it i
37:14 learn a bit more and i get more
37:16 sort of predictability right and then
37:19 also you get better at what you do so
37:20 you value for the so if you find
37:22 something that's actually asked
37:24 uh or people are looking for you also
37:26 get better with that then
37:28 and i think this is a this is a thing
37:30 that many many people do over time
37:33 and but that's also something you have
37:34 to think about right so you have to also
37:36 start maybe
37:37 think about this and then also say no to
37:39 projects because you think like okay
37:41 this is like i don't know it's a lot of
37:42 money or a very interesting client but
37:45 this is not like what i want to do right
37:46 i think this is
37:48 yeah this is yeah also something i'm
37:51 like like every like once a month i'm
37:53 like okay what am i doing here
37:55 is this really this is good or not and
37:56 then you start thinking about it but and
37:58 i think but i mean for me this is this
38:00 is also part of what what makes this so
38:02 interesting so you maybe when you agree
38:05 to take a client you don't know if you
38:07 like it or not and there is only one way
38:09 to find out if this is what you like
38:12 right to try it yes yeah
38:15 so by trial and error you focus on a
38:17 specific thing and then yeah
38:19 and i think right so sometimes you you
38:21 and there's like all all kinds can have
38:23 like oh so you it might be that like
38:26 this is something you're good at but
38:27 it's not fun right or it's something
38:30 that's a lot of fun but you're really
38:31 struggling with the so it's
38:33 a lot of self exploration to be done
38:36 so maybe you need a bit of both right so
38:38 you need uh something fun but that you
38:40 need to learn and at the same time
38:44 um
38:44 i noticed i think
38:46 that you have a couple of clients
38:48 multiple clients at the same time right
38:50 yeah so how does your day look like so
38:52 you work at the same time for
38:54 like during one day you have meetings
38:55 with multiple clients or you walk maybe
38:57 one day for one client and another day
38:59 for another client now i think that that
39:02 yeah is up up to you how you want to
39:04 organize it but from yeah i do i do sort
39:06 of
39:07 i'm managing like a different google
39:09 calendar for each client and then
39:11 trying to to update all the uh
39:14 availabilities keep them in sync
39:16 yeah now for me this really so it
39:18 reminds me when i was at orlando and was
39:20 doing this internal technical principle
39:22 role
39:24 right it's also you have different
39:25 projects and then you meet with them
39:26 during the day so that that
39:28 actually felt pretty
39:30 normal for me yeah
39:32 so how is your work now different from
39:34 work here within zolander
39:38 now i think it's it's
39:40 similar right but it's
39:42 also
39:43 uh like i have more freedom or i can i
39:45 can sort of mix so at zalando it's a bit
39:47 like okay if there's nothing you have to
39:50 if there's nothing you like nothing
39:52 happening right now
39:53 there's nothing you can do right but now
39:54 you can actually so that you can put
39:57 together your own mix
39:58 and i think it's very really interesting
40:00 you're seeing all these companies
40:02 uh different company cultures different
40:04 approaches different tech stacks and so
40:05 on
40:07 and i'm also curious do you work now
40:10 less than you worked full time or more
40:13 it's uh
40:15 so i don't know the past few weeks it
40:16 feels like i'm working much more
40:19 but the general was uh similar i think
40:22 right like 40 hours per week
40:24 approximately yeah i think i do like
40:26 normal
40:27 normal like
40:28 what is it like 10 to 6 days
40:30 um
40:31 but of course not not all of that time
40:33 is is built right you said so
40:36 so maybe i think the actual like client
40:38 hours maybe up to half of it and then
40:40 there is
40:41 um other stuff like
40:44 yeah like doing this or
40:46 working on talks or um
40:49 yeah just learning something its own
40:52 and in terms of salary if it's not a
40:54 secret like do you make more than before
40:57 like when
40:58 working full time or it's approximately
41:00 the same amount it's um
41:03 i think so far it's approximately the
41:05 same but it's uh or
41:08 so let's see let's see where we are
41:09 where at the end of the year okay when
41:11 you file your declaration rate yes some
41:13 month this was definitely more
41:15 um
41:16 yeah but i can't complain so
41:19 because i'm curious like if you're doing
41:21 pretty much the same work
41:22 and you're getting the same money
41:25 like
41:26 is it worth all this uh overhead yes
41:30 but i think yeah for me it's really
41:32 there's a sort of freedom and then like
41:35 doing a control thing also right and
41:37 it's also i mean so the we haven't
41:39 talked about this but when i started i
41:40 also thought maybe i maybe i do a
41:42 startup or i do some work on some ideas
41:45 of my own
41:46 and that's the right so at any point you
41:48 can you can say don't take new clients
41:51 or you can say yeah
41:53 i'm taking only like one client right
41:55 yeah and then you do that
41:57 um
41:58 yeah and i think the it's it's really
42:00 much more interesting than i think what
42:01 you can get like within a company
42:04 so that's one company
42:05 so basically if you work at a company
42:07 you have
42:08 all 40 hours
42:10 you have to devote to the company but
42:12 when you work as a freelancer and you
42:14 have multiple clients at some point you
42:15 can say okay i'm working no longer than
42:17 20 hours for my freelance projects and
42:20 then i'm working the remaining 20 hours
42:23 for my cool startup idea yeah maybe new
42:25 streaming analytics startup right yeah
42:28 twitter still so much potential
42:32 but i think it's also the
42:33 uh
42:34 the the like like in the day there's so
42:37 that's also something i really had to
42:38 get used to right it's like
42:40 so nobody's there's no
42:42 there's no boss right i mean you have to
42:45 you have to like do good work for your
42:47 clients but then
42:48 um
42:50 you can also just take the afternoon off
42:52 if you manage to keep it free of
42:53 meetings and then just do something like
42:55 this yes
42:57 yeah so this
42:59 yeah it's it's all up to you so it's
43:02 you have more freedom so if you want to
43:04 work uh from i don't know a different
43:05 country you just go and work yes yeah
43:08 and it's not like i think the
43:10 yeah i had times right so at
43:13 so sometimes at the company
43:15 not saying which one but but it's also
43:17 like there's not a lot to do and then
43:18 you're there for eight eight hours per
43:19 day and you sort of you feel like oh i i
43:22 felt like i owe them this time right but
43:24 now if if not what's happening then you
43:26 can just do the
43:28 couple of meetings and then you can the
43:29 rest of the day you can do whatever you
43:30 want so that's
43:32 um
43:33 yeah somehow so i feel a bit like my so
43:36 my den and my dentist is just next door
43:38 and sometimes i see him in the street
43:39 and i really feel like like i'm the
43:41 dentist now
43:42 because it's
43:45 you know so when i when i work i make
43:47 money if i don't i don't if i
43:50 close my my practice then
43:52 i can i don't know play the golf i don't
43:54 play golf but
43:55 so it's uh that's it's the there's
43:58 really some like a bit of being an
44:00 entrepreneur in this
44:02 yeah but uh so you get the freedom but
44:04 you need to worry about uh more things
44:06 yeah also promoting yourself it's one of
44:08 the like you get to to do you have to do
44:11 a lot of work that you don't build but
44:14 you need to do this in order to get new
44:16 clients right yeah
44:19 and um let's say you already have a few
44:21 clients and then there is a new client
44:23 who comes to you and says
44:25 hey i have this
44:27 new project for you and you really like
44:29 this project this is what you really
44:31 want to do but you don't have enough
44:32 capacities what do you do in this case
44:34 yeah that's a
44:37 that's a good question i don't know it's
44:39 uh no i think the
44:41 yeah it's
44:44 right but then i think in the end it's
44:45 also um
44:49 yeah i mean you you could i don't know i
44:51 think don't think that's a good move
44:52 right but you could also
44:53 say like no you want to do this
44:56 uh let me ramp down my other projects
44:58 and then i take this one
45:02 which is i don't know whether it's like
45:04 a big
45:05 but so in the end it's up to you right
45:06 so then they probably won't do another
45:08 project with you again and then if they
45:10 talk to people it's not good but the so
45:12 ultimately maybe doing this other
45:13 project is better
45:15 i mean there was a um
45:16 another book
45:18 uh
45:20 by
45:21 oh there was another book that is called
45:23 built to sell like if you build a
45:25 startup if you will build a startup but
45:27 actually you have the plan of selling it
45:28 right
45:30 and there it's also a lot about
45:31 standardizing your product
45:33 and especially if you start more like a
45:35 like a general i think this is
45:37 interesting for
45:38 we haven't talked about this yet but so
45:40 if you start with the consulting right
45:42 so if you get lots of new projects one
45:44 option would also be you say okay i'm
45:45 actually like founding a company i'm
45:47 hiring a few people and then they're
45:48 trying to build up like a consulting
45:50 agency
45:51 um yeah and so in this book so if you
45:53 want to sell it at some point you have
45:55 to it has to run without you so you have
45:57 to standardize everything a bit more but
45:59 that also involves maybe saying no to
46:01 clients you had for a long time so
46:03 i think this is also
46:04 part of the
46:06 but what you can do
46:09 so what are your plans do you want to
46:11 have a consultancy or you want to have a
46:14 startup or you don't know yet i don't
46:15 know i don't know
46:18 i don't know yet so this is the
46:19 um
46:21 yeah i'm not not sure
46:23 but in general i guess
46:25 so when you
46:27 start freelancing you don't want to do
46:30 this for the rest of your
46:32 you know uh before your
46:34 retirement yes
46:36 so what could be the next uh moves after
46:38 freelancing so you can um
46:42 start a company write a consultancy
46:45 company you can hire new people and then
46:47 they will work
46:49 help you work then you can also start a
46:50 startup i guess if you see that some of
46:53 the queries some of the projects you get
46:55 from clients they repeat they're about
46:58 the same thing you yeah i guess you can
47:00 kind of put this in a product and then
47:02 start for the company right yeah there's
47:04 so many options right
47:06 now you can i think the i think some
47:08 people they just like the freelancing
47:10 and the consulting and the freedom and
47:11 you do this and then maybe you get
47:13 better at negotiating an iron and then
47:15 you make enough money so that you also
47:18 like your retirement is taken care of
47:20 right i think that's definitely
47:22 um
47:24 part you can do you can
47:26 i think if you you you can do this for a
47:28 while and then maybe you find a company
47:30 and then you say like which you have a
47:32 great client and then you think okay i'm
47:34 i'm done with the this experimenting
47:37 i can become an employee again right so
47:39 at zerlando i interviewed a lot of
47:40 people um and then everything every now
47:43 and then there was also consultant right
47:44 and when you ask them why they want to
47:46 do this
47:47 uh one thing they always said it's so
47:48 they want more ownership so i think this
47:50 is i haven't experienced it yet but i
47:52 think if you do this for a few years
47:54 because you always always do like one
47:55 part of the project and then you're out
47:57 right you move on
47:58 so definitely
48:00 um
48:01 yeah you can what you said so if you
48:02 somehow
48:04 uh are more hands-on and you realize
48:06 you're always doing like the same thing
48:07 you can start building a product you can
48:09 do that you can also build up a um a
48:12 consulting agency
48:14 right but then you're you're somebody's
48:15 boss and also like
48:18 it's also very different from just being
48:19 right now all of a sudden you have less
48:21 freedom
48:22 yeah because you have a company to run
48:24 you have to care about people yeah
48:26 yeah um i remember seeing a question uh
48:29 i don't remember from who and i don't
48:31 remember how exactly it was phrased
48:33 but uh the the essence was that um what
48:37 is the output of your work usually like
48:39 is it like some sort of report is it a
48:41 presentation is it uh okay
48:43 yeah so
48:45 do clients get it and
48:46 yes um
48:49 yeah i think that depends a lot on what
48:51 you do right so in my case um so what i
48:54 have right now are more longer running
48:56 projects so
48:57 three to six months where i work with
48:59 the team
49:00 and then i think actually the output is
49:03 like what the team did in the end but so
49:05 but as part of that
49:06 i'm also you're also doing like concepts
49:08 and you're writing that down like a
49:10 principle right like you said yeah so
49:13 like what the this is what the principle
49:15 would do in delanda they would uh
49:17 help a team
49:18 [Music]
49:19 do better right better
49:22 but i think it could also be i mean
49:24 especially if you go into
49:26 productionizing more right i think what
49:27 many people are doing is
49:29 there's like um
49:31 like a thing where you
49:33 you do workshops with the company and
49:34 then you do an analysis and say okay
49:36 this is the stuff you need to work on
49:38 right this is this could be an outcome
49:41 um if if you're like a hands-on
49:43 freelancer of course then the like what
49:45 the code is your outcome
49:47 um
49:48 for data science i know one guy who does
49:50 a lot of these like pocs so he goes to a
49:53 company and they don't have any data
49:54 science capabilities but so he discusses
49:57 with them
49:58 um like what they want to work on they
50:00 produce some data and then he does like
50:02 a
50:03 like a like a first prototype to see
50:04 whether it's worth going deeper right so
50:06 yes
50:08 i mean
50:09 if you like it right so there's a lot of
50:11 different stuffs you can do and find
50:13 something that makes sense for you i
50:14 think
50:16 and
50:17 we talked a bit about that so there are
50:19 things you're good at and there are
50:22 things you are not good yet but you want
50:24 to learn them
50:26 so
50:27 let's say if there is something you want
50:29 to be better at and that's something
50:30 interesting
50:31 so how do you actually
50:33 become better at this as a freelancer so
50:35 let's say it can be i don't know project
50:37 management or something like something
50:40 just to take a complete example so you
50:42 you like it's an example i don't know if
50:45 that's the case for you but let's say
50:46 you
50:47 are not very good at project management
50:49 and you want to become better so how do
50:51 you do this as a freelancer if uh like
50:53 you cannot say tell your client that hey
50:56 hey like actually i suck at this but i
50:58 want to learn this thing for your money
51:00 like
51:03 yes
51:04 good question
51:06 i think it's um um well i think there's
51:09 this thing where you're already good at
51:10 it but you want to get better at it and
51:12 then but then
51:14 um sort of you're looking a bit for
51:16 like like stretch assignments right so
51:18 stuff where you think like i can i think
51:20 i can do this but maybe it's a bit far
51:21 out or so
51:23 and i think you can also be be open
51:25 about it but you can also say like look
51:26 i never did this before so i cannot
51:28 guarantee whether it works but let us
51:29 try
51:31 and then usually i think during the
51:32 project there's often opportunity
51:34 because so there's something that needs
51:36 to be taken care of and then you can try
51:37 to do some of these things
51:40 um
51:41 yeah other things i think you can also
51:43 sort of team up with other people and
51:45 and see how they do it and learn from
51:46 them
51:48 and then i all the other classical stuff
51:50 right but i think um
51:52 yeah so there's this thing where sort of
51:54 your
51:55 um
51:56 yeah so i think you're looking or if you
51:59 want to do this so you're looking for
52:00 projects which are like a little bit
52:02 outside of your comfort zone but but not
52:04 so far that you that you think there's a
52:05 real risk you won't do it so basically
52:08 you need to feel comfortable about being
52:10 able to deliver the project yes yeah but
52:12 not like
52:14 yeah so not a moonshot but
52:16 yeah and then that's basically like at
52:19 work right uh well maybe at work you
52:22 have some more delay because you can say
52:24 okay like i'll just learn whatever new
52:26 technology
52:28 uh
52:28 but with the client you maybe don't
52:30 always have this opportunity to yeah
52:33 you know to learn for the money of the
52:35 client that's true yeah but you have
52:37 this i mean this is then sort of in your
52:39 your unpaid unpaid hours right you
52:41 always have a lot of time to do that if
52:42 you want to
52:44 yeah we have quite a few questions so um
52:48 i found there is one very interesting
52:50 one
52:51 what is your most relevant learning uh
52:53 when finding clients so what did you
52:55 learn from this process of finding plans
52:59 uh-huh what is my
53:02 um
53:02 [Music]
53:06 no i think it yeah i think also this
53:09 writing this this the summary i think
53:11 this was really
53:12 um
53:14 so it felt a bit like okay this is an
53:16 extra step but actually it was really so
53:17 i think it's good to be really clear
53:19 about like what the project is before
53:21 you start it
53:22 so make sure you're on the same page
53:24 right
53:26 yeah okay
53:30 and then there is a question from
53:31 somebody from germany uh
53:33 and the question is about like how do
53:35 you deal with all these normal air
53:37 quotes uh paperwork for german paperwork
53:41 yes it's uh like it's a lot of um
53:44 bureaucracy because like you need to
53:46 fill a lot of uh papers you need to like
53:48 do this monthly
53:50 tax declaration
53:52 so how do you deal with all that yeah
53:54 okay so i'm not not a tax accountant or
53:56 anything so there's oh no you don't sue
53:58 me
54:00 so the the great thing in germany is
54:01 that there is this um
54:03 uh concept right so you don't have to
54:07 there's this there's like a group of
54:09 people essentially where your
54:12 sort of your work
54:13 is mostly based on your expertise like
54:15 like architects doctors and so on and
54:18 you don't and they have a special
54:20 um
54:22 that's a setup i think that doesn't
54:23 exist in too many countries right and
54:24 one one good i think is sort of you just
54:25 pay income tax so if you have a company
54:27 you also have to pay some tax on the
54:30 like on the revenue but it's just that
54:32 and actually it's quite simple so you
54:33 just tell your
54:35 um you write a letter to your tax
54:38 office and you tell them you're doing
54:40 this as a freelancer as a tribal woofer
54:42 now
54:43 and then i think so my case they asked
54:44 me like what was what is the estimate
54:46 for my
54:47 income for next year and based on that
54:49 they say how much you are going to pay
54:51 in advance right
54:53 yeah and the other thing you have to do
54:55 is you have to apply for this
54:58 okay and usually then from them you get
55:00 you get like a text number
55:02 like a new text number for this activity
55:04 which is different from the one you had
55:05 on your on your employee work
55:08 and with that you can apply for this um
55:11 this this web
55:13 this um
55:15 id
55:17 and that's getting to technically
55:21 yourself right you do all this yourself
55:23 do you right like a tax advisor or no no
55:26 i haven't
55:27 i mean i i should get one but i
55:29 so actually i also thought maybe i can
55:31 try to learn it myself then they they
55:33 sort of tell you also like based on the
55:36 estimate they also tell you whether you
55:37 have to do this monthly or not
55:39 um or like
55:42 in longer increments and then you have
55:44 to at the beginning of each month you
55:45 but this is the
55:47 where you can just build the stuff in
55:48 and it takes a while to figure out that
55:50 it's just like one or two numbers you
55:52 just fill in how much money you made
55:54 yeah it's if it takes a while even for
55:56 germans to figure out and foreigners are
55:58 doomed yeah it's not that it's like five
56:01 things you need to know
56:02 first and then
56:04 and then let's see what happens next
56:05 year when i have to do my test sector
56:08 so uh so the goal so that was a two-part
56:11 question so like uh the the second part
56:13 was if you decide to operate as a
56:15 freelancer or as a company i think you
56:17 answered the answer as a freelancer an
56:20 alternative is to start a one-person
56:22 company i guess yeah
56:24 and
56:26 you decided that like for your case
56:28 maybe it's better to start as a
56:30 freelancer
56:31 yes yeah because i mean if you found a
56:33 company then that's that's a lot more
56:35 hassle right so you have to do like a a
56:37 proper so you have to find a company you
56:39 have to go to an author you have to do
56:41 this funny thing where he reads you the
56:43 whole contract and then you sign it
56:44 don't know whether you did it before
56:46 have you done that already
56:48 yes
56:50 for a different thing for a mortgage
56:52 yeah
56:53 but yeah like it's one hour and a half
56:56 just not always reading out loud very
56:58 fast and very uh
57:01 i guess it's just a part of uh
57:04 that's just part of the how it's done
57:06 forever yes
57:07 uh and then the you have to do this
57:09 yearly text
57:10 which is quite and you can't do this
57:12 alone yeah the one thing is as a
57:14 freelancer you have like personal
57:15 liability
57:17 uh but there are some some like
57:18 professional insurances which which are
57:21 quite expensive 200 euros but i sort of
57:23 cover that i think i hope so technically
57:26 a company can see you if you did
57:28 something that affects their business
57:30 right yes and
57:32 that's why you need to have this
57:34 insurance to
57:36 kind of make sure that if that happens
57:38 uh you don't have to sell everything you
57:40 have just to pay for that right yeah
57:44 okay
57:44 so well it's the same it's the same with
57:46 doctors and architects right so there
57:48 okay
57:49 so you would you recommend to have that
57:51 insurance
57:53 yes well some some clients also
57:55 requested that i have it ah okay okay so
57:57 they they will not work with you unless
58:00 you have that yeah
58:01 they want to make sure that uh
58:03 uh like if something happens to their
58:05 production database right yes
58:07 if i delete the production database
58:09 yesterday
58:10 how do you do this if you don't do
58:12 hands-on work
58:13 i don't yeah
58:15 i guess yes no there's also stuff like
58:18 uh i think so right now not but if
58:20 you're on site and then somebody trips
58:23 over your laptop and they get hurt so
58:25 and all this stuff so it covers a lot
58:27 yeah
58:28 and then i mean there's always like gdpr
58:30 and
58:31 data
58:33 so if you lose the data and so on right
58:35 so yeah
58:36 and
58:37 if you start reading insurance
58:39 of us you just wonder okay there's a lot
58:41 of stuff that can go wrong
58:44 probably insurance companies did witness
58:46 all these things
58:47 going wrong that's why they have them
58:49 right but i think it's it's actually so
58:51 become a freelancer in germany is not
58:53 it's it's less complicated than you
58:55 think so it's not
58:56 it's not very formal actually
58:59 so do you think this freelance market is
59:01 affected by globalization by
59:05 now everyone can work remotely so
59:08 why would a german company hire you
59:10 instead of going to china or india or
59:13 some other countries like because the
59:15 cheaper labor there so what do you think
59:18 is globalization affected but
59:20 um
59:22 i guess yes
59:23 i think but as i said so this freelance
59:25 thing is like a huge trust
59:28 trusting i think right so you
59:29 [Music]
59:30 uh i mean i know that there are some and
59:32 i think that's also part of i mean it
59:33 depends on what you want to do right if
59:35 you're just like a front-end freelancer
59:37 so there's there's this point where it's
59:39 already a bit commoditized and i think
59:41 there are some websites where you can
59:42 just go if you just want to do deep data
59:43 science projects right yeah and i think
59:46 there it
59:47 sort of you're competing more globally
59:50 but if if you're more specialized or if
59:53 you if you have like your
59:55 like a like a name
59:57 which sort of like
59:59 have a bit um
1:00:01 but then then that's sort of how you get
1:00:02 it get it and um
1:00:05 because as everybody knows right so they
1:00:07 are
1:00:08 it's super hard to find good data
1:00:09 scientists so
1:00:12 yeah but i mean for me that was also
1:00:15 part of the reason why why i started now
1:00:17 was because so i already i've always
1:00:20 thought about it but then i thought i
1:00:21 could never travel that much as a
1:00:23 consultant right so it seemed to me if
1:00:25 you have a number of clients you have to
1:00:26 like travel a lot and i didn't want to
1:00:28 do that or i couldn't because of my
1:00:30 family small kids and so on travel you
1:00:32 mean like because
1:00:33 like let's say if you have clients from
1:00:35 different parts of germany or different
1:00:36 parts of you know europe or world then
1:00:39 you would need to go on site and then
1:00:41 talk to them right but now since
1:00:43 everyone is
1:00:44 doing things remotely you don't have to
1:00:46 do that right yes yeah and the people i
1:00:48 talk to are also like like the
1:00:49 consultant companies they say you know i
1:00:51 think they really changed right so
1:00:52 people understood this remote remotely
1:00:55 work also works and it's of course also
1:00:57 because
1:00:59 and then the environment also
1:01:01 yeah thanks before we wrap up so maybe
1:01:05 do you have any advice for people who
1:01:06 just
1:01:07 who want to start freelancing
1:01:10 yes
1:01:11 just try it no
1:01:13 i think actually i was surprised i think
1:01:15 the so i think the good thing about you
1:01:17 know
1:01:18 i think
1:01:18 mostly data scientists are watching this
1:01:20 right so it's a
1:01:23 yeah people are really
1:01:26 looking super hard for to finding good
1:01:28 data scientists right so the market is
1:01:30 really in our favor
1:01:32 um and i think the
1:01:33 if you have a good network if you know
1:01:35 people
1:01:36 who went to new companies or something
1:01:38 right so i think if you if you know
1:01:40 people who would hire you if you quit if
1:01:42 you would say why don't you work for us
1:01:44 then there's a good chance and i think
1:01:46 if you have
1:01:47 if you have enough money to
1:01:48 to try it out for a few months like
1:01:50 three months or so
1:01:52 just do it and i think if you yeah so
1:01:55 i mean if you're interested in all the
1:01:58 uh all the rest so if you
1:02:02 or the complexities we discussed yeah
1:02:04 how to do your you need to be ready yes
1:02:07 your vit text declaration every month
1:02:11 what do you think about freelancing
1:02:14 and working at uh the company full time
1:02:17 at the same time is it realistic or like
1:02:19 maybe somebody wants to find out if
1:02:21 freelancing is for less i think okay we
1:02:23 don't want to quit our job and then have
1:02:26 no certainty
1:02:28 whether it will work out or not yeah
1:02:31 okay is it
1:02:32 i think uh realistic no i don't i for me
1:02:35 it was it wasn't so i for me when i when
1:02:37 i had a job there was no no energy left
1:02:40 but maybe if you're young and
1:02:42 i don't know yeah still have some
1:02:46 i don't know
1:02:47 i think you can try i mean the problem
1:02:48 is maybe because
1:02:50 um
1:02:51 so if you're already working full-time
1:02:53 it's hard to also work with the client
1:02:55 during office hours yeah exactly and
1:02:57 they want you
1:02:58 uh to be present during office stores
1:03:00 yeah okay so you need to find a client
1:03:02 from the states or from australia or
1:03:04 something yeah
1:03:06 and then it's like
1:03:07 you don't have life anymore yes
1:03:10 okay clear um how can people find you
1:03:14 on twitter with the key brawn is just my
1:03:17 and then linkedin
