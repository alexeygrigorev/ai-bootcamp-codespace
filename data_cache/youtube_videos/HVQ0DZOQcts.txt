0:00 welcome everyone and the first talk
0:02 today
0:03 is called the abc of data science it's
0:06 not the alphabet
0:07 but it's three different types of data
0:10 science
0:11 roles analyst builder and consultant and
0:14 we have a special guest today
0:15 denim i am a really big fan of denis
0:18 work
0:19 so i try to listen every time he appears
0:21 somewhere
0:22 i try to listen to this whether it's a
0:24 podcast episode or stream or whatever
0:27 i'm a big fan and uh you danny
0:30 um are a big source of his inspiration
0:33 for me
0:34 personally and i am super happy to have
0:36 you on the show so thank you for joining
0:38 us today danny
0:39 thank you so much for having me alexei
0:41 this is amazing
0:42 can't wait to to talk about the abcs of
0:46 data science and maybe a bit more as
0:48 well
0:49 but before we do that before we start i
0:52 would like to
0:53 ask you about your background
0:56 and the first thing i want to ask is uh
0:59 probably
1:00 anyone who follows you on linkedin knows
1:02 that that you're
1:03 a meme generating machine like you're
1:06 like i don't know every time i open my
1:08 linkedin
1:09 feed i see a meme from you and it's
1:11 awesome
1:12 and i want to know like how do you get
1:15 inspiration for them
1:16 it must be difficult to to create so
1:18 many so many memes like how do you do
1:20 that
1:21 so i think the the inspiration for my
1:23 memes mostly come
1:24 from things that i've experienced in in
1:27 real life
1:28 so whether it's
1:31 or someone doing some dodgy practices
1:33 with the data science or they're
1:35 looking to try and trick some management
1:37 by
1:38 telling them something or whatever it is
1:40 like i try and
1:41 draw on my own experiences to poke a
1:45 little bit of fun because everyone knows
1:46 the
1:46 the funniest memes are always based on
1:48 truth so
1:50 usually i just need to think about
1:52 things that i've done in the past or
1:53 i've seen people
1:54 do incorrectly for the for the data
1:56 science and
1:57 things just come to my brain so you must
1:59 have seen quite a few things that people
2:01 did i believe it's not
2:05 not something that everyone has
2:07 experienced
2:08 uh yeah and like i don't know if you
2:12 came here because you saw uh
2:14 a post from denny you probably saw the
2:16 video that he made
2:17 and this made this video i still cannot
2:21 unsee this video
2:22 so i will um i will include link in the
2:25 comments
2:26 but uh yeah be careful once you you look
2:29 at this
2:30 this image will stay in your head so it
2:32 will not go away for a couple of days
2:34 believe me so how did you learn to do
2:37 these things so this is not like an
2:39 average data scientist uh
2:41 not something that an average data
2:43 scientist can do
2:45 yeah so my i'd call it creative video
2:49 editing but i've always
2:51 i think i spent too much time on social
2:52 media just consuming lots of different
2:55 content
2:55 so i've gotta i feel that i've developed
2:58 a strong intuition for what is
3:01 interesting or at least what is
3:02 different and then i just try and
3:04 do the video editing to make it happen i
3:06 think i'm still very junior
3:08 when it comes to video editing i have a
3:10 friend who
3:11 actually works for the australian
3:13 broadcasting company and he always tells
3:14 me or
3:15 i should give you some lessons on how to
3:17 edit properly
3:19 i have no idea what i'm doing but this
3:21 is this is amazing and of course like
3:23 the the topic was uh
3:24 this is um street right so this is like
3:27 pretty much
3:28 on uh on topic to our discussion today
3:32 and yeah maybe like on a more serious
3:35 note
3:36 maybe you can tell us about your uh like
3:39 apart from this the most useful skills
3:41 you have that we already talked about uh
3:44 it would be quite interesting to know
3:46 what was your career journey so far so
3:48 maybe you can tell us a bit about that
3:50 definitely so um hi everyone for
3:54 joining this year my name is danny ma
3:57 i am i would call myself a recovering
4:00 data scientist
4:01 after having i've spent probably the
4:03 past
4:04 five years or so working in data science
4:06 um but i actually started off my career
4:09 working in data analytics specifically
4:12 in campaign analytics
4:14 so i was the one in the background
4:16 trying to
4:17 identify which customers to send
4:18 different emails based off their
4:20 shopping behavior
4:22 i did that for two years it was my first
4:24 job out of university
4:26 for university i took an undergrad in
4:28 commerce
4:29 um majoring in actuarial studies
4:32 so the it's sort of like the maths and
4:34 the statistics behind the insurance
4:36 models and the financial models
4:39 and also business economics however i
4:42 don't think i actually remember much at
4:44 all from my university day so i
4:46 learnt almost everything on the job
4:49 instead of when i was at university
4:51 too busy partying or doing something
4:52 crazy so
4:55 um yeah straight after university i i
4:58 actually
4:58 as part of my university i managed to
5:00 get a few internships as part of my
5:02 program
5:03 working for insurance companies so this
5:05 was in the
5:06 in the actuarial department where they
5:08 would essentially have lots of
5:10 crazy excel they used to use a lot of
5:12 sass so
5:13 statistical and analysis software um to
5:16 do
5:17 some of the it's more like reserving
5:20 modeling and trying to model
5:22 all the claims and the different things
5:24 like that within the insurance world
5:26 um they didn't let me anywhere near it
5:28 so it's not like i learned very much
5:30 when i was
5:30 doing my internships but i i got
5:33 exposure to some of the data stuff there
5:36 but i also realized that i didn't want
5:37 to work within the insurance space i
5:39 wanted to do something a little bit
5:41 different
5:42 maybe like a non-traditional use of data
5:44 and that drew me towards my first
5:46 role outside of university which was
5:48 with quantium
5:50 a data consulting firm within australia
5:52 that was where i did the campaign
5:53 analytics
5:54 and retail analytics as well so
5:57 uh think of consumer packaged goods
6:01 uh and the different things like that
6:03 you can buy in a supermarket
6:04 so i did that for two years um i kind of
6:07 stagnated a little bit
6:09 and i wanted to find a more challenging
6:11 thing to do
6:12 so around i would say i can't remember
6:14 what year it was but
6:15 around let's say a year and a half into
6:18 my role there
6:19 i started waking up every morning at 5
6:21 00 a.m in the morning to learn python
6:24 before then i had very little
6:26 programming experience
6:27 um i dabbled with a little bit of r when
6:30 i was at university
6:32 what did you use as an analyst like sql
6:35 oh yeah most of it was sql excel um
6:39 i used sas again because that was the
6:41 only thing they they gave us
6:43 in that company at the time um so i was
6:45 automating a lot of
6:46 sql jobs um through whatever
6:49 tools i could get my hands on but
6:52 looking back my sql code back then was
6:54 very very bad like
6:55 it must have been very like not
6:57 optimized at all because i had no idea
6:59 what i was doing
7:00 so after i think after i spent my time
7:03 learning a bit of python and
7:05 um i asked some of my mentors okay what
7:07 do i what do i do
7:09 i don't feel like doing this campaign
7:11 stuff much longer so
7:13 they told me oh you should do data
7:14 science and
7:17 back then i had no idea i had no idea
7:18 what data science was so i had googled
7:20 data science and kind of fell
7:24 i wouldn't say i fell in love with it
7:25 straight away because i didn't know what
7:26 it was
7:27 and i actually started using kaggle
7:30 trying to do different things i did
7:32 almost every mistake that
7:34 every new data scientist would would
7:36 have would have made
7:37 on their career and their journey and
7:40 then i managed to
7:42 actually apply applied for a few data
7:43 science roles even though i didn't have
7:45 any experience
7:46 got rejected for all of them and then i
7:49 eventually
7:50 made it into a role with the bank so one
7:54 of australia's largest banks within the
7:55 digital
7:56 area so i was doing more along the same
8:00 lines of what i was doing before but in
8:02 a different space
8:02 so think of all the campaign targeting
8:05 and
8:06 looking at the different click funnels
8:08 and different things like that on their
8:09 website
8:10 so same thing but this time with python
8:12 right well this time
8:14 i i tried using python but it was not
8:16 very good
8:17 so sql again mostly sql okay
8:21 but the the thing that helped me bridge
8:23 into the data science world was
8:25 we actually had an opportunity to apply
8:27 data science to some of the problems
8:28 within that digital space
8:30 so one of my first few projects i
8:33 actually got to work hand in hand with
8:34 the data science team
8:36 and after that project i got absorbed
8:38 into the data science team so that was
8:39 around
8:40 when i became a data scientist by title
8:42 only
8:44 which year was it oh it must have been
8:49 2016 i think
8:51 2016. sounds about right it's still
8:54 around that time when companies had no
8:56 clue what data science is right
8:57 i think so i think it things haven't
9:00 really changed much in
9:01 yes exactly
9:05 um but yeah after i so i moved into the
9:08 data science team i started working on
9:10 more traditional machine learning
9:11 projects so
9:12 think of all like the customer
9:15 propensity modeling
9:16 um looking at time series forecasting
9:20 we actually did a lot of experimentation
9:22 as well so
9:24 things about it was more it was still
9:26 within the campaign and the marketing
9:28 space but it was much more rigorous in
9:30 terms of how you would actually run the
9:31 experiments and how you
9:33 examine the results with all the
9:35 statistical testing and
9:36 everything up front as well so the
9:38 target control groups
9:39 but with more rigor so i spent a lot of
9:42 time doing that
9:43 and then towards the end of my three
9:46 years
9:46 in the data science team at the bank i
9:48 started working more on data assets
9:50 so it was more of a exploratory data
9:54 role
9:55 but i would also be implementing the
9:57 final
9:58 data products that we were using across
10:00 the different teams
10:02 so one of my big things was to try and
10:04 capture all the different customer
10:06 interactions around
10:07 the bank so imagine someone takes out
10:10 some money at an atm
10:11 they use their card to pay for a coffee
10:13 down the road and then they make a
10:15 complaint on the website because
10:17 something happened with their
10:18 transaction i'd be able to track all of
10:20 that at a customer level and kind of
10:23 make draw it on a timeline so people can
10:25 start analyzing the journeys
10:27 but we were also using all of those
10:29 events essentially to create
10:31 massive feature sets and machine
10:33 learning training
10:34 data so we're using that quite often
10:38 and then soon after i built that product
10:41 i got an opportunity to do the same
10:43 thing but
10:44 back at the retailer but this time doing
10:46 it on the cloud and doing it with more
10:48 digital
10:48 data sources so think of like google
10:52 google ads facebook ads instagram um
10:55 all of those different things as well as
10:57 their or their shopping data and
10:59 whatever they had whatever else they had
11:01 at a customer level so we got to
11:03 build that in gcp um
11:07 and there was it was a really great
11:08 project because it was quite challenging
11:10 and then the team
11:11 used that data to build multi-touch
11:13 multi-channel digital attribution models
11:16 um but yeah my my last projects were
11:19 around that space
11:20 where it was all about combining data
11:23 automating machine learning pipelines
11:25 um and doing everything on the cloud
11:27 essentially
11:28 okay so you basically went uh like we
11:31 will talk about these abcs a bit later
11:33 but you kind of captured at least two of
11:35 them
11:35 right then well a and b but yeah maybe
11:38 let's uh take a
11:40 like a step back and talk like i i do
11:42 have a couple of questions about your
11:44 career journey but
11:45 maybe we will uh go back to to that a
11:47 bit later
11:48 and i already see questions in slider so
11:51 we will also get back to them
11:53 um but we will first we'll talk about
11:55 like these different
11:56 types of data scientists and then we
11:58 will cover questions
12:00 so uh so the topic today is the abc of
12:03 data science
12:04 science right so what are these abcs
12:07 like uh each letter is a is a role
12:10 yeah and i'm also curious um like how
12:13 like was it you who came up with this
12:15 idea and if yes like how did it happen
12:18 um so there's a really famous article
12:21 written by and i forgot the exact name
12:23 of the person but i think they were
12:25 working in the data science team
12:27 in airbnb where they defined like
12:29 there's two types of data scientists
12:31 there's a type a
12:32 who is the analyst type and a type b who
12:35 is the
12:35 building type last year when i was doing
12:38 my live streams
12:39 on youtube as well i added an extra
12:43 element
12:43 of a type c where it's sort of like a
12:45 combination of both but
12:47 usually more more within the management
12:49 realm so
12:51 i think the a and the b they're already
12:53 there i just kind of took them and
12:55 talked about it a little bit deeper and
12:56 then i added the c i don't think
12:58 i haven't seen other people talk about
13:00 the c lens of it yet
13:02 but we'll see someone someone might
13:04 claim it and then i'll just
13:06 it's yours but you can say okay i was
13:08 actually first like here's my video
13:11 yeah but let's let's talk about this a
13:14 and
13:14 b and see what are those okay so
13:18 when we think of type a a stands for
13:20 analyst
13:21 b stands for builder so traditionally
13:24 when we think of the analyst type
13:26 we think of um it was
13:29 similar to the experience which i had
13:30 when i came in
13:32 doing a lot of data analysis being able
13:34 to look at insights do data
13:36 visualization
13:37 make some dashboards and try and figure
13:39 out what's going on with the data
13:41 that's a very large component of data
13:43 science because
13:45 we can't really be doing machine
13:46 learning if we don't know exactly what
13:47 the problem is that we're solving so
13:49 a lot of the upfront work and the
13:51 investment of time and energy
13:53 for many of the projects will be
13:54 definitely done on analyzing data and
13:56 making sure that we're solving the right
13:58 problem
13:59 so the analyzing type is usually
14:02 going to come from that data analytics
14:05 background maybe with the statistics
14:06 background
14:07 um and very research heavy as well so
14:11 um you might have you might have seen
14:13 some of the articles where
14:15 um a lot of it was about the origins of
14:18 the first few data scientists that ever
14:21 appeared
14:21 in i think mostly most of them were in
14:23 silicon valley
14:25 and this was like the first first time
14:26 that the term was actually being used
14:29 was because they brought on phds ex-phds
14:32 x-ray
14:33 researchers from like from all the
14:36 powerful universities like mit stanford
14:38 et cetera and they put them into their
14:40 teams in linkedin facebook
14:42 and google and they were there to
14:43 essentially do research and try and
14:46 try to figure out exactly where they
14:47 should invest in money or how they can
14:50 use the data to build a new product
14:52 that will help the customer experience
14:54 so you ended up getting things like the
14:56 facebook
14:56 knowledge graph the linkedin network
14:59 graph
15:00 and i think like google pagerank was
15:02 origin like one of the original
15:04 like large-scale machine learning
15:06 products as well so
15:08 i think that when we think of the
15:10 analyst type
15:11 they they were that type of people who
15:14 are the ones who had to
15:16 figure out what they were doing and
15:17 analyze a lot of things
15:19 so they come from a very heavy research
15:21 background so
15:22 just to to somehow summarize so the
15:26 as i understood the first uh first thing
15:28 is
15:29 data science type a is not necessarily a
15:31 data analyst so this is a
15:33 slightly different role right and then
15:35 the second thing i heard is like the
15:36 first data scientist ever
15:38 who appeared they were of this type
15:41 right and then the other types kind of
15:43 followed
15:43 after that and uh
15:46 um yes of what kind of uh background
15:49 they usually have
15:50 we mentioned like phd so these are
15:52 people who who are doing research
15:55 um is it the only type of background
15:57 they have or
15:58 there are some other backgrounds i would
16:01 say
16:02 that the originals they were mostly
16:04 coming from that really strong technical
16:06 pedigree of having all the training
16:08 doing a lot of research and writing
16:11 quite a lot of
16:12 code essentially i think over time
16:16 because the companies realized that
16:17 these people were really rare
16:19 and most of them were very happy to
16:21 continue doing research instead of
16:22 moving into the industry
16:24 um i felt or a lot of the other people
16:27 who were working with data originally
16:29 so your traditional analysts your quants
16:33 maybe some of the database people as
16:35 well they started
16:37 converging onto this role of data
16:39 scientists
16:40 and because most of them came from that
16:42 analytical background and they were very
16:44 good with the data
16:45 it made perfect sense for them to kind
16:46 of slot in and start picking up some of
16:48 the
16:49 other skills that those advanced phd
16:52 researcher types were already using
16:55 so this could have been like your your
16:56 python your r
16:58 all those different languages which were
17:01 which are additional on top of the
17:02 traditional
17:04 data analyst skill set of using your
17:06 your sql excel
17:08 tableau what have you data visualization
17:10 tools so i think it was
17:12 most of the background of the people i
17:14 think that
17:15 the actual study background didn't
17:17 matter so much
17:18 it was more about their work experience
17:21 of course you still have people who are
17:23 doing
17:23 technical degrees like the computer
17:26 science degrees and
17:28 statistics and mathematical degrees that
17:30 would also slot
17:31 into the a type but they kind of blend
17:34 in with the b type as well which i'm
17:35 i'm sure we'll cover really soon also
17:38 yes
17:39 um so what i heard the skills are what
17:43 the skills they need the the type a data
17:45 scientist
17:46 they need first to have
17:50 to know how to program a bit like use
17:52 this python are
17:54 um have a bit of theoretical background
17:57 like node theory
17:58 and usually like often these are people
18:01 who were
18:02 originally coming from these big
18:03 universities uh famous universities
18:05 um so they need to know like um ideas
18:08 like
18:08 theory of machine learning they know
18:10 need to know how to experiment need to
18:12 know statistics um
18:14 like how to design experiment things
18:16 like this is there something else that
18:18 they also need to know
18:20 i think the the analyst types would also
18:23 have to present
18:24 a lot of their insights to the business
18:27 so
18:28 this also ties in with the type c data
18:30 scientist who kind of
18:31 specializes in doing that communication
18:33 piece but for a lot of the time when
18:35 you're doing a lot of analysis even as a
18:37 data analyst you're expected to
18:38 present back your findings to the
18:40 business to try and drive some sort of
18:43 commercial decision or to drive some
18:46 direction in
18:46 in the project so i definitely think
18:49 communication is also very important
18:51 um but i think yeah to round up the
18:54 skill sets for the type a data scientist
18:57 most of it is it's essentially
18:59 a data analyst plus additional bits and
19:02 pieces
19:02 that come from research background a
19:04 little bit of programming
19:06 and maybe more emphasis on the
19:08 communication than before
19:10 yeah but like analysts are already quite
19:12 good at this
19:14 storytelling like uh visualization they
19:16 just need to add a bit of
19:19 coding on top of that and if they don't
19:21 know theory they also need to
19:24 perhaps study more statistics because
19:26 usually data analysts already know about
19:28 a bit of statistics you just need to
19:30 learn a bit more
19:31 right and then um then also
19:34 learn a bit of machine learning right um
19:37 is how
19:38 this is this how the learning path uh
19:40 like let's say we have a typical
19:43 data analyst who knows how to write sql
19:46 queries who knows how to create
19:47 dashboards
19:48 who knows how to do
19:52 nice data visualization and they want to
19:54 become this type a
19:56 data scientist how the learning path for
19:58 them will look like
20:00 so i can talk about this quite well
20:03 because that was exactly my path
20:05 i when i started my journey into data
20:08 science i could
20:10 build like do the sequel very badly did
20:13 the
20:13 do the excel do the dashboarding
20:16 do a little bit of r but i had no idea
20:19 what the other skills were
20:21 so a lot of my journey was essentially
20:23 just trying to figure out what i should
20:25 learn
20:26 once i had that direction when i started
20:30 working with people who were in a data
20:31 science role
20:32 who had data science experiments or
20:34 experience
20:36 and they could guide me on what i should
20:38 be learning that was when i saw my own
20:40 growth
20:40 and development really like just pick up
20:42 like a hockey stick
20:43 so um definitely i felt that
20:47 before i had that sort of guidance i was
20:49 just kind of fumbling around in the dark
20:51 reading a lot of different articles and
20:53 kind of being stretched everywhere
20:55 so you hear like oh you need to
20:57 understand all the theory before you
20:58 even start doing any programming and
21:00 then someone else would say
21:01 no you just go implement the machine
21:02 learning things and then you pick up the
21:04 theory
21:04 so i feel like yeah that's what i would
21:08 say is all just
21:08 go and try a few things and when you
21:11 need to learn the theory you'll know
21:12 when you need to learn the theory
21:13 because you have no idea what's going on
21:14 so
21:16 i think that was that was the same
21:17 advice given to me also
21:19 so um but yeah i would say for anyone
21:22 who's currently
21:23 in a data analyst role or doing
21:26 work which is not even in analytics but
21:28 you're managing databases or
21:30 you're um i wouldn't say software
21:33 developer that comes into the
21:34 the other into the type b but for anyone
21:37 who's working with data
21:38 and they're doing things and visualizing
21:40 and whatever
21:42 there's definitely a path into data
21:43 science you just have to be curious and
21:45 keep working on it
21:46 and work with good strong mentors who
21:49 can give you
21:50 that level of guidance to push you in
21:51 the right direction
21:54 yeah so that's uh so i'm just
21:57 trying to like how can we formalize this
21:59 being curious right
22:00 so you can just uh like let's say you
22:03 you are trying to put a learning plan
22:05 and then you put
22:06 python there you put machine learning
22:07 theory there you put uh
22:09 some other things and then the last
22:11 point is okay i have to be curious
22:13 and then so how can can somebody you
22:16 know
22:16 uh become curious or this is something
22:20 intrinsic that you cannot control
22:23 it's a it's a great question i think for
22:27 there's always going to be a spectrum of
22:29 curiosity so
22:30 a lot of people just need to know what's
22:33 going on
22:33 to the to the very nth degree so i've
22:36 i've met people who
22:38 they wanted to do data science so they
22:39 started learning python but then they
22:41 wanted to figure out how the python
22:43 code got translated into some compiler
22:46 and then got translated into binary code
22:48 or something something crazy like that
22:50 so i think that's probably on the one
22:52 end of the spectrum where you need to
22:53 know everything
22:54 every single thing and on the other end
22:57 of the spectrum people
22:58 um might just not want to know
23:02 anything they just want to accept orders
23:05 and they don't take the initiative to
23:06 kind of push themselves more like
23:08 these people it's not a bad thing or
23:10 anything like
23:11 they just prioritize different things
23:13 for their career
23:14 um or in life in general so um
23:18 like my my parents are like that in some
23:20 sense where they just
23:21 they're just not very curious about many
23:23 things and they just they do their nine
23:25 to five and then
23:26 they spend time with their family and
23:28 that was enough for them so
23:30 i think it's very honourable um but
23:32 everyone lies
23:33 on the spectrum of curiosity but the the
23:36 thing about curiosity
23:37 is that you can literally just tell
23:39 yourself
23:40 i want to be more curious i i want to
23:43 know this more
23:45 so i think for anyone who um
23:48 wants to improve their curiosity and
23:50 keep learning more different things you
23:52 literally just have to make the decision
23:53 that you want to learn more things
23:54 and it's as simple as that so i feel
23:57 that
23:58 yeah there's no need to really like
24:01 formally define the curiosity
24:03 i think it's going to be different for
24:04 everyone but everyone can do
24:06 their own version of curiosity yeah so
24:10 the way i understood it uh correct me if
24:12 i'm wrong
24:13 let's say i'm working with python code
24:16 and maybe this is the other end of the
24:17 spectrum you mentioned and then i
24:19 execute a line of code
24:21 and then it works but i start wondering
24:23 okay why it works
24:25 and then i start digging deep okay like
24:27 in scikit-learn we do this
24:28 dot fit what dot hit does right and then
24:31 i go okay
24:32 like i have no idea what this code does
24:34 let me just learn some theory
24:36 like how logistic regression works right
24:38 and then i learn that
24:39 i come back and see okay like how what i
24:42 just learned how does it translate to
24:43 code
24:44 and then trying to sort of unwrap this
24:46 thing did i understand correctly
24:49 i think that would be on definitely on
24:50 the higher end of
24:52 on of curiosity that was exactly
24:55 how i did it as well so the first time i
24:58 was starting to use the machine learning
25:00 packages i actually read the underlying
25:03 papers within the documentation
25:04 but i'm different to me to many people
25:08 as well but i feel that
25:09 many of my mentors did exactly the same
25:11 thing and that's what they told me to do
25:13 so
25:14 um for anyone out there like if you need
25:16 to learn machine learning theory
25:18 there's no better place than to actually
25:20 read the papers which
25:21 which are implemented by psychic line
25:24 for example or
25:25 light gbm or or xg xgboost the papers
25:28 are all there as part of the
25:29 documentation
25:30 and it's an amazing resource you can
25:32 learn a lot just by reading through the
25:33 math and trying to figure out
25:35 what's going on and i think we're
25:37 touching slightly the b
25:39 type of the data scientist because the
25:42 those are more
25:43 this is at least my understanding based
25:45 on what i heard previously from you
25:47 uh uh yeah so maybe let's talk about the
25:50 the b
25:51 type builder what do they do okay so
25:54 i think of the b type as they're
25:57 essentially software
25:58 engineer software developers just with a
26:01 very
26:02 focused realm of data science
26:05 applications
26:06 so for example um if you're doing a lot
26:09 of stuff in the cloud
26:10 and you need to set up the
26:12 infrastructure
26:13 manage all the workflows work with the
26:15 data engineering team to make sure all
26:17 the pipelines are
26:18 good and solid maybe you force
26:21 other members of your data science team
26:23 to write very clean code
26:24 so you can write unit tests and
26:27 functional tests and different things to
26:28 make sure that
26:29 the code will run in production all of
26:32 these things are hallmark
26:33 traits of a type b data scientist
26:37 essentially they're a software engineer
26:40 for lack of a better term i think you
26:42 can also think of these guys as their
26:44 the new age machine learning engineers
26:46 as well where they're the ones building
26:48 those systems and the machine learning
26:49 ops
26:50 and automated machine learning programs
26:52 and different things like that
26:55 i think one of the key differences
26:58 between the building type and the
26:59 analyst type is that
27:01 the building time always wants to work
27:03 in the production environment
27:05 like there's almost like a different
27:06 mindset where the type a
27:09 data scientist will they're very happy
27:10 to play around in
27:12 jupiter notebooks to just take data from
27:15 wherever in a csv file
27:16 and just explore and see what's there
27:18 and try to apply some machine learning
27:20 to it straight away
27:22 after you figure out what the problem is
27:23 of course but the type b
27:26 type data scientist
27:29 doesn't really want to do that they
27:31 think of all of that stuff as kind of
27:33 like a waste of
27:34 time because they they're going to have
27:36 to refactor it or
27:37 they're going to have to change it
27:38 somehow so it's almost everything
27:40 like people always talk about like
27:42 technical debt there's like there's a
27:44 famous google paper of the technical
27:46 debt of machine learning systems
27:48 maybe we'll try and find a link and
27:50 throw it up somewhere but that's a
27:51 really good one
27:53 written for type b data scientists but
27:56 it's always i think it's a very good
27:58 thing to be aware of
28:00 even as you're starting in the field
28:01 because you can make really
28:04 bad decisions up front which will cost
28:06 you a lot of money but if you haven't
28:07 experienced it before
28:09 you will not know how much money it
28:11 might potentially cost you in the future
28:13 or
28:13 cost your company in the future so i
28:15 took a note
28:16 i will add a link of course yeah but
28:20 like to me like you mentioned technical
28:21 that so basically type a
28:23 creates technical depth and type b fixes
28:25 it sort of
28:26 almost sometimes
28:30 i feel that so that the perfect middle
28:32 ground
28:33 is where you have a type b data
28:34 scientist doing the exploration
28:36 it would be amazing because they can
28:38 kind of put in all the
28:40 the rigor and the infrastructure from
28:41 day one and then you start exploring
28:44 and testing models in production
28:46 essentially
28:47 i think that was um through my journey
28:50 i managed to get from being the crazy
28:53 type a
28:53 data scientist who had no idea what they
28:55 were doing with the programming
28:56 in the production environment to working
28:59 in a production environment with
29:00 engineers and software engineers and
29:01 data engineers
29:03 and being forced to work how they work
29:06 and seeing the light in a sense that's
29:09 why i call
29:09 i sometimes refer to myself as a
29:11 recovering data scientist
29:13 because once you once you get exposure
29:16 to the way things
29:17 should be done in a very formal
29:21 software engineering type space you
29:24 can't unsee it just like the video for
29:26 my promotion of this
29:27 talk as well um these things are
29:30 essentially
29:30 threshold concepts where someone teaches
29:33 you something
29:34 it's very hard to forget about the way
29:36 that you now view the world
29:38 so yeah there's there's a lot of value
29:41 in becoming a type b
29:43 data scientist because um when we think
29:46 of
29:46 value from machine learning a lot of it
29:48 is automated value
29:50 it shouldn't be um someone has to put in
29:52 10 hours of work to get
29:54 back x amount of dollars it should be
29:56 okay
29:57 i built this software i built this model
29:59 it's going to continuously generate me
30:01 additional revenue
30:03 and because you're a good analyst you'll
30:04 be able to measure what your
30:06 your incremental value is as well from
30:08 this model
30:09 but if you are a type b data scientist
30:12 as well you can build and automate that
30:14 whole system
30:15 and do the measurement for you and
30:16 that's it gives you a bit more
30:19 buying power as a as an employee as well
30:22 so i think it's really important to
30:23 cover both skills
30:25 but you mentioned that these kind of
30:27 profiles they have a
30:29 quite different mindset right so one is
30:31 more exploratory and
30:32 the other focus is more introduction uh
30:36 but it's you also mentioned that it's
30:38 possible and you
30:39 uh you are leaving proof that it's
30:41 possible to go from type a to type b
30:44 so how so how can uh
30:48 this type a data scientist change their
30:51 mindset and go to uh type because it
30:54 must be quite difficult right you're
30:56 you're used to playing with jupiter uh
30:58 like
30:59 executing cells in a different order and
31:01 uh you know
31:02 like take a look at these kernels right
31:05 so they are
31:06 probably created by type a data
31:08 scientist so
31:09 they have a lot of knowledge right but
31:12 they don't necessarily have uh
31:14 this mindset and this engineering skills
31:16 so how do
31:17 we they go from uh you know
31:20 being researchers to being engineers
31:24 i feel that there's oh there's at least
31:27 two ways two ways that i can talk about
31:29 so one way is
31:33 as a type a data scientist you get
31:34 forced to work on a project in
31:36 production
31:37 so you have no other choice and for lack
31:40 of a better word you'll have your ass
31:41 kicked
31:42 absolutely by whatever's going on
31:45 because your
31:46 model won't run your data is missing
31:48 something goes wrong
31:49 your the package that you're using
31:51 doesn't exist on some server
31:53 things will go wrong and things will go
31:54 wrong horribly bad yeah
31:56 so it's you're learning how to be a type
31:59 b data scientist the hard way
32:01 um i had a little bit of that experience
32:05 but i
32:05 managed to work with people well at
32:07 least i reached out to people who knew
32:09 what they were doing and they
32:10 told me what to do so that was part of
32:13 my experience at the bank when they
32:14 didn't have
32:16 many systems so a lot of the systems
32:18 were building from scratch
32:20 so a lot of the auto machine learning
32:22 the deployment
32:23 um like we were some of the first teams
32:25 to put our models into docker containers
32:27 and deploy them somewhere
32:29 and have like a git version thing to
32:31 actually
32:32 control all the different model versions
32:34 so things like that
32:35 they sound very well to some people now
32:38 they sound very basic
32:40 because we have all these crazy new ml
32:42 ops things coming
32:43 coming in to do that for us but back in
32:46 the time back in the day we were doing
32:48 all all of that manually
32:50 okay yeah so you mentioned a couple of
32:52 things you mentioned
32:53 you mentioned git you mentioned docker
32:55 you also mentioned
32:57 cloud and i think he used google cloud
33:00 right
33:00 so what are the other things that one
33:03 need to learn
33:04 to to transition from type a to type b
33:07 in addition to these things
33:12 the most important thing is probably um
33:14 being
33:16 again like another cliche like you have
33:17 to be curious enough to actually
33:19 improve your your programming skills
33:22 because i feel that a lot of data
33:24 scientists because they they're using
33:26 machine learning they're writing a lot
33:27 of python code
33:28 it's very easy to to almost trick
33:31 yourself into thinking that you're a
33:32 good
33:33 software developer i know for me i did
33:35 that all the time i thought i was
33:36 amazing until i worked with people who
33:39 were actually amazing
33:40 and then so it's always about trying to
33:43 find
33:44 like there's the saying like if you're
33:45 not the smartest person in the room then
33:47 you're in the wrong room sort of thing
33:49 um which i don't always believe in but i
33:52 feel that
33:52 there's always something to learn from
33:54 other people and if you can learn from
33:56 the best people out there that's that's
33:58 probably ideal so you want to
34:00 almost challenge yourself by always
34:03 being outside of your comfort zone
34:05 the more you spend being the top dog or
34:08 you're the one setting all the standards
34:09 in the in the team for example
34:12 um likely you're not learning as much as
34:14 you
34:15 as you could if you had other people to
34:17 learn from so
34:19 the one of the major things for me was
34:21 when i moved from team to team
34:22 throughout my career i i just happened
34:25 to be very lucky
34:26 to be paired paired up with someone who
34:28 was amazing
34:29 so when i was when i first joined the
34:31 bank i was paired up with someone who
34:32 was amazing at sql so i learned how to
34:34 write sql properly
34:35 and i i i still read back my code and i
34:39 think to myself what the hell is this
34:42 it doesn't make any sense i do that all
34:44 the time as well like probably the code
34:46 that i'm writing now
34:47 in six months i'll look back at it i'll
34:49 just won't know what's going on
34:51 but they're not to look at it yeah
34:52 better not to look i think
34:55 but uh i would say so git is definitely
34:59 a very important skill even for type a
35:02 data scientists
35:03 like being good with git github
35:05 bitbucket or any of the version control
35:07 is almost
35:08 mandatory these days for data science
35:10 roles
35:13 i do think that the cloud is it's not
35:16 i would say it's super popular now
35:18 already but in future just
35:19 almost everything will move to the cloud
35:21 so cloud skills are definitely going to
35:23 be a thing
35:24 um if they're not already in whichever
35:26 area people are that they're tuning in
35:28 from
35:28 um literally we would do everything on
35:31 the cloud
35:32 so and everything from getting data we
35:35 would do it on the cloud
35:36 because all the databases are on the
35:38 cloud and to
35:40 we would just then grab the data from
35:41 the database and
35:43 dump it out somewhere on the cloud into
35:45 storage
35:46 into google storage or different things
35:48 like that and then we would
35:50 spin up a virtual machine on the cloud
35:51 and you load the data in from the
35:53 storage area so everything is quite
35:55 seamless from that perspective and
35:58 a lot of people think that it's there's
36:01 two camps for people who are learning
36:02 cloud stuff
36:03 it's either oh this is too difficult i
36:05 need like a devops guide to help me
36:06 do everything and then there's the other
36:08 end where you kind of overestimate your
36:10 ability to do
36:11 some of the cloud stuff and you can end
36:13 up costing your company a lot of money
36:15 so there's two different spectrums again
36:18 but
36:18 i think in general the cloud is not too
36:20 difficult to learn it's one of those
36:22 things which you just learn by doing
36:23 so the more you expose yourself to these
36:26 different technologies the faster you'll
36:27 be able to pick it up
36:29 um and the beauty of it is you can learn
36:31 for free or virtually for free
36:33 you can sign up for a google account or
36:35 an aws account or a microsoft
36:37 azure account and you get like a few
36:39 hundred dollars in credit so you can
36:41 kind of learn
36:42 there's a lot of different online
36:44 resources as well
36:46 yeah in a way you kind of got lucky to
36:49 uh you had to implement these things
36:51 right and then you also
36:53 got lucky that there were people around
36:55 who could help you
36:57 to actually to to learn the skills to
36:59 master
37:00 them but i imagine there are many um
37:03 type
37:04 data analysts who do not
37:07 whose work do not require that so they
37:09 are not pushed by the company
37:11 to do this sort of things and they also
37:14 like even if they are pushed to do these
37:16 things
37:17 they do not have somebody to talk to
37:21 so these are kind of two things uh here
37:23 in one so maybe let's start with the
37:24 first one
37:25 um so if company so if your work
37:29 doesn't uh like if you don't need to do
37:32 these kind of things
37:32 at work how do you develop these skills
37:36 like how do you learn cloud how do you
37:38 learn docker if all
37:39 if if all you do is equal
37:45 this is a challenging one okay
37:49 i feel that it so all of these things
37:51 can be learnt
37:52 but the the challenge is that it will be
37:54 difficult without
37:55 um like a very strong incentive for you
37:58 to learn it
37:59 so maybe we can give some incentives
38:01 here and like
38:02 i feel that in the future for the data
38:05 scientists who know
38:06 cloud computing versus those who don't
38:08 um the ones with cloud computing will
38:10 always get first
38:11 first round preference even if
38:15 the other person has more experience and
38:18 i think that's just going to be a thing
38:20 unless you're very well known and you
38:22 have a very good reputation
38:23 um cloud computing will be a thing so i
38:25 think it's
38:26 when people are trying to push
38:28 themselves to learn different things
38:30 having really good incentive devices or
38:32 different ideas to
38:33 force you to learn it at all costs is
38:36 very good
38:36 um another good another good thing could
38:39 be
38:40 you essentially get rid of the life bets
38:42 so you tell your
38:43 tell your team oh we're moving to docker
38:46 and then you dockerize every single job
38:48 that you have
38:49 that would be more extreme you need you
38:50 need to have a lot of trust
38:52 from your company to actually let you do
38:54 that
38:55 but it's possible as well the other
38:58 things you could do
38:59 could be take take it little steps at a
39:02 time
39:02 so at this stage you might not be very
39:05 familiar with docker
39:06 or with any other tools that you might
39:08 want to progress in to become more of a
39:10 type b data scientist
39:12 uh reach out to a few friends who are
39:14 skilled in that area
39:16 who might be working in the same company
39:18 so they understand the systems
39:19 and ask them for advice um i want to do
39:22 this
39:23 how do i do it better and then for sure
39:26 the engineers will have some idea about
39:28 how to do things better because
39:29 engineers usually do but you'll
39:32 definitely be able to learn something
39:33 which you would not have been exposed to
39:35 by talking to other people within the
39:36 company and if there's no engineers in
39:39 that company you can ask
39:40 a friend or reach out to someone on
39:42 linkedin who might have some more
39:43 experience on the thing
39:44 and solicit them for advice
39:47 but i think yeah take things step by
39:50 step
39:51 there's there's not always a need to cut
39:53 the lifeboats and aim for the
39:55 aim for the moon all the time but it's
39:57 good to have that mindset as well and to
39:59 always be improving
40:00 i think that's that's more important
40:02 than aiming for perfection from the
40:04 beginning
40:05 and i think you kind of answered the
40:07 second uh the second part of that
40:10 question like how to
40:11 how to get people to help you like oh
40:14 there's no one
40:15 in the company like you reach out to to
40:18 people and
40:19 there is a question like how do i find
40:20 the mentor so this is the
40:23 this is not an answer right so you can
40:25 reach out to people
40:27 on linkedin perhaps different
40:29 communities uh
40:30 right and uh maybe other teams in the
40:33 company
40:34 can also be an option and then you also
40:37 mentioned one thing
40:38 like if you at work all you do is sql
40:41 you can try to challenge the status quo
40:44 like just approach your management and
40:45 say
40:46 hey like this is how companies are doing
40:49 this right now
40:50 please let me give like
40:53 let me spend some time and try to
40:56 uh documents the the thing we have right
41:00 and then uh this is how you learn right
41:02 but
41:03 like management have to has to have a
41:05 lot of trust in you
41:08 you have to almost like you have to do
41:09 the time to build up the trust and your
41:11 reputation
41:13 for the business to actually trust you
41:14 um for
41:16 one of one really great example that
41:18 i've got from
41:19 one of the people that i've been
41:20 mentoring on our slack group um
41:22 essentially he's been working in a role
41:24 which was advertised as like a
41:27 an analytics role like a statistical
41:29 analyst role that he was doing ended up
41:31 doing a lot of reporting work in excel
41:33 which is not great but he
41:36 showed some of his managers and his
41:37 bosses oh i've been learning the stuff
41:40 in the background he was learning how to
41:41 do machine learning
41:43 to predict churn predict lapse predict
41:45 different things like that
41:47 so he recommended or he said to his
41:49 management oh
41:50 um we have a lot of data about our
41:52 customers i might be able to figure out
41:54 who are the customers who might not be
41:55 buying with us again
41:56 and i we can try different things but
41:59 i'm not sure if it will work but if you
42:01 give me a little bit of time we can see
42:02 what happens
42:03 and simply because he asked and he was
42:06 very open about his aspirations to apply
42:08 more techniques which are very common in
42:12 the business while
42:12 they let him try it and the project was
42:14 very successful
42:16 so i think different things like that
42:18 people just need to
42:19 be curious take the initiative and
42:23 almost own like put put more of their
42:25 skin on the line
42:27 it's like skin in the game or whatever
42:29 it is like
42:30 try to if there's strong incentives for
42:33 you to do something you'll
42:35 more likely you're more likely to do it
42:38 yes
42:38 and so you mentioned persuasion so this
42:41 is one of the
42:42 communication skills and we talked about
42:43 communication a bit that this is a very
42:45 important part for the type a
42:47 data scientist and also there are
42:49 questions in chat about
42:50 data story telling skills uh
42:53 communication in general
42:54 and i think it kind of brings us to the
42:56 type c data scientist i think
42:58 for the type c these skills are more
43:01 important than for others
43:03 so maybe we can talk about this role a
43:05 bit more
43:06 differently who is the the type c data
43:09 scientist what do they do
43:11 so i've i've been lucky enough to work
43:13 with a few type cs
43:14 when um okay let me rephrase that a
43:18 little bit so
43:19 type c stands for consultant so they're
43:22 essentially
43:22 when people think of the data scientist
43:24 as being
43:26 like in the past it used to be the data
43:30 scientist was the intersection of
43:32 the programmer the mathematician
43:36 and the business domain expert so this
43:39 type c is essentially that person in the
43:41 middle
43:42 but with very strong consulting skills
43:45 so
43:45 originally when i was working in data
43:47 science the the team that i was working
43:49 in we were actually part of an
43:51 internal consultancy model so we'd go
43:53 out and try and win
43:54 projects with different parts of the
43:56 business and then we would
43:57 work in the projects deliver them value
43:59 show them how much value we delivered
44:01 and then we would get another project
44:03 with a different part of the business
44:05 with a different part of the bank
44:06 because of the results that we already
44:08 received
44:09 so it was essentially like a traditional
44:10 consultancy where they do exactly the
44:12 same thing they're
44:14 very heavy in sales they have people
44:15 working and delivering the thing
44:17 and then they always have really strong
44:19 stakeholder engagement and communication
44:22 to make sure that the business the
44:24 business problems are being solved
44:25 adequately with the right solutions so
44:28 in the same way the type c is
44:30 essentially
44:31 um the ideal type c data scientist
44:35 would have been an analyst would have
44:37 also been a builder
44:38 because they'll be able to know what
44:40 technical decisions and trade-offs they
44:42 have to make
44:44 and also they'll usually type c as
44:47 either people leader or project manager
44:50 or
44:50 they're just very very good at
44:52 persuading and talking to business
44:55 so and usually if you're if you're a
44:57 strong talker you're more likely to be
44:59 a people leader anyway so it all kind of
45:01 kind of ties in
45:02 so usually these type c data scientists
45:05 they'll be your
45:06 like your general manager of data
45:07 science your head of data science
45:09 um chief data scientist um
45:13 but however i feel that there's there's
45:15 a precautionary tale around the type c
45:18 data scientists as well because it's
45:20 very very rare for someone to actually
45:22 have gone through
45:23 the type a experience and the type b
45:26 experience
45:27 and then they want to go in and lead
45:29 projects and lead teams
45:31 it's a very very rare skill set not many
45:34 people
45:34 want to do all of those things so
45:37 there's always incentive for people to
45:39 make it look like
45:40 they want to do those things so
45:43 probably alexi smiling because um there
45:46 are many
45:48 i wouldn't there's like type c let's
45:49 call it charlatan
45:51 data scientist but essentially it would
45:54 be
45:54 like a senior leader who doesn't have a
45:56 lot of the technical experience but they
45:58 might be very good with the business
46:00 they might be very good
46:01 at making decisions but they won't have
46:05 all the experience to actually make
46:06 informed decisions themselves
46:08 they'll have to rely on their team a lot
46:11 so
46:12 they don't have to have this kind of or
46:14 maybe like they have to
46:16 have this kind of skills to call
46:18 themselves
46:19 the data science consultants but in
46:22 general
46:23 for them to be successful they don't
46:24 have to have these skills as long as
46:27 there is somebody
46:28 of type a and type b data scientists
46:30 around them who can
46:32 say hey like this is not possible to do
46:34 for example you're selling something
46:35 that
46:36 that is that will not uh work and things
46:39 like that right
46:40 definitely maybe my word charlatan is a
46:42 bit too harsh this
46:44 may i i'll offend a few too many people
46:46 but definitely it's
46:47 it's more around like the the people
46:49 leader the business leader
46:52 um who doesn't have the experience so
46:54 there's kind of like different types of
46:56 type like consultants as well so you can
46:58 think of them as the true consultants
47:00 who who aren't working very deep in the
47:03 data
47:03 and they're more talking about process
47:06 to solve problems trying to
47:08 work closely with the stakeholders to
47:09 figure out what the problems are make
47:10 sure that their
47:12 um their concerns and issues are all
47:14 addressed so they're very very important
47:17 um but all too often we see that
47:20 there are some of these leaders who who
47:23 are not very
47:24 technical and it's not a bad thing but
47:27 there are some people who
47:28 pretend that they're very technical but
47:29 they're not very technical
47:31 so it just comes off as a bit charlatan
47:34 mistake but yeah i
47:38 imagine that uh it also usually this is
47:41 the kind of role that pays
47:42 usually more than the other uh like you
47:45 have more responsibility and then this
47:47 also skill of persuading people
47:51 uh communication is also something uh
47:53 rare
47:54 among technical people um so this is
47:57 like a pretty rare person that's why
47:59 uh like this uh um like the the pay is
48:02 higher and this is well deserved
48:05 that's why many people think okay i
48:06 probably want to go
48:08 down that road i want to become uh like
48:11 a manager
48:12 or basically grow myself and do this
48:15 kind of work
48:16 more but it's uh
48:19 also again like a change in the mindset
48:22 right so
48:23 uh one day your type b
48:26 like building things and then the second
48:28 day when you become this type c
48:30 like you rarely do hands-on work right
48:33 so this is like quite a shift
48:35 so do you know like maybe you have
48:36 recommendation for people who
48:38 think they will like type c work
48:41 but they are not sure like how can they
48:43 safely test
48:44 this and see if this is something for
48:46 them or not
48:49 i haven't thought of this one actually
48:50 it's really really interesting
48:52 um i think for the
48:56 for the people who are looking to
48:59 who are starting right now so you're not
49:01 sure whether you want to be a type a
49:03 an analyst a type b for a software
49:05 developer
49:06 builder or a type c for a consultant
49:10 usually let's say you're coming in as a
49:13 junior
49:13 so you don't have too much work
49:15 experience you haven't had too much
49:17 exposure to technical
49:18 data analysis or different things like
49:20 that i usually recommend them
49:22 to start off as either an analyst or a
49:25 builder depending on their background
49:26 so if you have software development
49:28 skills definitely try and start off as a
49:29 builder
49:30 because you are you're already a few
49:32 steps ahead on the ladder
49:34 um if you did an analytics degree or
49:36 anything which has a lot of
49:37 analysis or excel or tableau or anything
49:39 like that
49:40 start off as an analyst because that's
49:42 where your strengths are so
49:44 those two are fine but when people start
49:46 thinking about okay
49:47 i'm in it to reach the top
49:50 i want to manage business i want to
49:54 be the team leader i want to manage
49:57 people
49:57 i want to make the big project decisions
49:59 so
50:00 usually if that's your mindset when
50:03 you're starting
50:04 you it's not ideal
50:07 because you for most people when they're
50:10 when
50:11 when they get to that level they usually
50:13 have a ton of experience
50:15 within the deep technical realms or they
50:17 have a lot of experience coming in
50:19 from the side as well so let's say i've
50:22 seen i've worked with really really
50:23 successful
50:24 like general managers of data science
50:27 and head of data science or whatever
50:29 where they've come in from a
50:30 non-traditional data science background
50:33 they might have done something within
50:35 the data space like a
50:37 head of insurance modeling or they were
50:39 working in
50:40 campaign marketing or different things
50:42 like that so they're very very switched
50:44 on commercially
50:46 so for a few of our viewers we're
50:47 they're probably coming in
50:49 from that sort of background as well so
50:52 they've got quite a few years of
50:53 experience in a non-related
50:55 or either a non-related or a
50:57 semi-related field
50:58 to data sites and they're wanting to
50:59 kind of move into the space
51:03 the thing that's most important for the
51:05 consultant the type c data scientist
51:07 will be a commercial mindset so that
51:09 commercial acumen being able to make
51:11 decisions
51:12 people leadership being able to talk to
51:14 businesses convince
51:15 convince leaders to do something as well
51:18 as the storytelling piece and
51:20 all of those persuasion components
51:23 they're really really important
51:24 um but i think for anyone who's starting
51:27 off
51:28 and you want to end up becoming a type c
51:31 um definitely it's a really great goal
51:34 to have
51:35 but the you really want to try and
51:38 figure out in the short to mid term what
51:39 you want to focus on because
51:41 it's going to be very difficult if you
51:43 only focus on doing the
51:45 people skills and the project management
51:47 and everything to
51:48 get to the head of data science role
51:50 like it's just not going to happen
51:52 um unless you move around and be a
51:55 little bit dodgy
51:56 it might happen okay or a bit of luck
52:00 also will not have a bit of luck also
52:02 here
52:03 um so as i understood like a good
52:05 background for the type c
52:07 uh data scientist is like they either
52:09 have to be
52:10 like to have experience working as a
52:12 type a or type b or maybe they
52:15 try to do both and this is ideal when
52:17 they become type c
52:20 are there other
52:23 how to say like is there a
52:26 different type of background that is
52:28 suitable for this role for example
52:29 product managers right because they
52:31 already have the skills
52:32 they can they are good communicators
52:34 they can tell stories
52:36 but they don't necessarily have this uh
52:39 exposure to machine learning
52:40 like can they become a good type c
52:42 consultant data scientist
52:45 so in the past i've worked in teams
52:47 where there was a formal role called
52:48 data science product manager
52:50 that would essentially be the product
52:52 manager for data science
52:53 products or data science projects
52:56 where there would be machine learning
52:58 data analytics maybe
53:00 some reporting or different things but
53:01 they would have that
53:03 program lead would be this product owner
53:06 so in some sense it would be
53:09 it's quite a natural transition so let's
53:11 say you're working in a startup for
53:13 example
53:14 you're dealing something where it's like
53:16 a
53:17 maybe a front end facing thing where
53:19 you're a product manager product owner
53:21 and you have to you manage a lot of the
53:23 different processes
53:24 that are going on with the technical
53:26 teams but you might not understand
53:28 what they're doing with the code in the
53:30 same way
53:31 these data science product managers
53:33 usually have the same sort of
53:35 relationship with their teams as well
53:37 and it's almost the the people who i've
53:39 seen in that role are almost
53:40 transplanted
53:41 out from those teams with traditional
53:44 product managers
53:45 and they're told okay manage this data
53:47 product thing and learn on the fly
53:49 so it's definitely possible whether you
53:52 would call them a type c data scientist
53:54 or not
53:54 that would be another point of
53:56 contention
53:58 i feel that for the people who who do
54:00 come from that product management
54:02 background and then they start learning
54:04 some of the data science skills
54:05 and they are actually very passionate
54:07 about learning
54:08 um like how to how to use git or how to
54:11 use docker how to
54:12 how to analyze data and visualize an r
54:14 or different things like that
54:16 then i think that's fine like for me
54:19 it's okay
54:20 um but for a lot of i find that
54:23 for a lot of people moving into that
54:25 sort of space it's just not very time
54:27 efficient
54:28 for them to learn those other things
54:29 because they won't be adding
54:31 as much value as they if they just focus
54:33 on their role as like a delivery manager
54:36 so it really depends on the amount of
54:37 flexibility you get in different
54:39 companies um whether they give you that
54:41 opportunity or not
54:44 yeah i do think it's very useful to
54:46 learn like data is the future
54:48 right yeah and it helps to speak the
54:51 same language with data scientists and
54:53 engineers so i think they do that
54:55 and so apart from these
54:59 three roles we talked about analyst
55:01 builder consultant
55:03 um like to build a successful product we
55:05 need to
55:06 to have other people in a team so we
55:08 already talked about the product manager
55:10 uh and then in chat people mention uh
55:13 uh a data engineer and this is by the
55:16 way also an interesting question about
55:18 the data engineer
55:19 but yeah so first maybe so who
55:22 else do we need to have on the team in
55:24 addition to product manager
55:25 these three types of data scientists and
55:31 data engineer who else do we mean so if
55:34 we think of like let's try and build up
55:36 like the perfect
55:37 data science team to deliver something
55:40 into production
55:41 so in the past i used to think of data
55:43 scientists as
55:44 kind of like a swat team like you just
55:47 drop them into a business problem
55:48 they figure out what the hell is going
55:50 on and then they tell the business what
55:51 to do and then they make it happen as
55:53 well
55:53 and then eventually they yeah it would
55:56 be perfect it's like the perfect
55:57 business team so if we were to develop
56:00 that sort of team we would definitely
56:02 have
56:03 let's start with the engagement first so
56:04 you'd have at least
56:06 one consultant type or
56:09 they could be a product manager but
56:10 they're very heavy on the engagement
56:12 with the stakeholders
56:14 so they would be like the team lead
56:15 essentially leading the project
56:17 leading the team interacting with the
56:19 business so
56:20 at least one person there they usually
56:24 so in the past i've seen teams where one
56:26 person is a business lead
56:27 so they'll be very hands-on with the
56:29 business very strong commercially
56:31 they'll have a counterpart which is the
56:33 tech lead so very similar um
56:35 with software engineering teams as well
56:37 so you would have
56:38 a tech lead who's also very good at the
56:40 business but very very good at the
56:42 engineering
56:43 so you would ideally have a tech lead
56:45 who's very very good at the data science
56:47 doesn't necessarily have to be very good
56:49 with the engineering or the devops or
56:50 anything like that
56:51 but they'll be able to talk to those
56:53 different teams so you need a connector
56:55 lead person so
56:58 those two are critical the next two
57:01 would probably be
57:02 um ideally you'd have a domain expert
57:06 so whether that's a business analyst or
57:07 a data analyst that works directly in
57:09 the team
57:10 and they'll be talking with the business
57:12 because most of the time when you're
57:14 working on a data project
57:16 your team won't be familiar with the
57:17 data that you need to work with you need
57:19 to go out and find out what's going on
57:21 you need to actually physically get it
57:23 from some silo somewhere in the business
57:25 as well
57:26 so you need these people who are really
57:27 really strong at sql strong with
57:29 communication
57:31 strong with exploration skills to figure
57:33 out what's going on read documentation
57:35 to find out
57:36 when the data was built why it was built
57:39 what are the processors
57:40 what are the etl stages all of those
57:43 right yeah otherwise you have to like go
57:45 in and figure out what's going on from
57:47 the
57:47 from the code unless if they're not
57:50 doing it with code
57:51 they'll you be at least
57:54 yeah so you need at least so how how are
57:56 we going
57:57 so one one business lead one techn tech
58:00 lead
58:00 one let's call it like a data lead so
58:02 they're very very good
58:04 like they probably work as a data
58:06 engineer
58:07 or it would be more like a like a data
58:10 engineer who would be more
58:12 business side so a data engineer here
58:16 because there is a question maybe we can
58:17 touch on that a bit oh yeah data
58:19 engineer
58:20 does not fit into into any of these
58:22 letters so
58:23 data engineer is not the a b or c right
58:26 i think data engineer would be closest
58:28 to a b so i've actually
58:30 worked with a a lot of data scientists
58:32 who used to be engineers
58:34 and they were very firmly in the type b
58:37 type data scientists because that's
58:38 where their background was
58:40 um but they were just they were amazing
58:42 because
58:43 they were very very smart if you told
58:46 them like oh you need to apply this
58:48 mathematical theory or statistical
58:50 theory to the problem they'll just read
58:52 the source code and
58:53 be able to implement it almost like for
58:55 like straight away
58:57 so definitely data engineers as data
59:00 scientists
59:01 very good very good very good fit okay
59:04 so type b
59:04 right yeah irena answered that
59:08 that she thinks that data engineer is
59:11 type b so she's correct correct 100
59:16 um so we have back to our team so we
59:18 have
59:19 yeah team lead um oh like so the team
59:21 lead the tech lead
59:23 a data lead so they may or may not be a
59:26 data engineer or a data analyst
59:28 it doesn't really matter but they're
59:29 like the domain expert
59:31 then you would have your technical data
59:34 science team
59:35 so you would ideally have at least one
59:37 analyst type so they'd be out
59:39 trying to explore different things they
59:41 have a much more strong focus on
59:42 exploring
59:43 but they would work hand in hand hand in
59:45 hand with the type b
59:47 where the type b will be setting up the
59:49 infrastructure for them um
59:50 telling them okay if you're going to
59:52 explore like this let me
59:54 figure out what data you need and we'll
59:55 try and fit it into this thing
59:57 so then you can start working in docker
59:58 from day one or something like that
1:00:00 the the ideal team so i would say if you
1:00:04 have two really strong
1:00:06 type a and type b data scientists you
1:00:09 should be sweet
1:00:11 ideally you'd have more people learning
1:00:13 from them as well so if they were your
1:00:14 senior people you'd have
1:00:16 maybe one or two people underneath them
1:00:18 to shadow them and learn but i think
1:00:20 that should be almost enough for
1:00:23 like the leanest team that you'd want to
1:00:26 try and solve a lot of problems
1:00:28 maybe have one more person who is let's
1:00:31 call them like a type a
1:00:33 that is doing more of a data analytics
1:00:35 function so
1:00:36 once the once the data scientists have
1:00:39 been
1:00:40 building their models and exploring
1:00:42 their models and using docker to do all
1:00:44 these things
1:00:44 at scale then the results would pop out
1:00:47 and ideally they would be analyzing the
1:00:49 results
1:00:49 with another data scientist who's very
1:00:52 focused on doing the measurement
1:00:53 piece because i think measurement is the
1:00:56 thing that's always
1:00:57 left out when we deliver projects um
1:01:00 like measurement of not just the value
1:01:03 of what we're doing but
1:01:04 how much time are we saving are we
1:01:06 solving the problem properly
1:01:08 what was the previous rate that the
1:01:09 problem was being solved
1:01:11 um how much uplift are we getting and
1:01:13 what is the cost
1:01:15 um business profit yeah business metrics
1:01:18 based but
1:01:19 being able to translate all of the work
1:01:21 that the data science team is doing
1:01:23 into time savings and cost savings
1:01:27 to show business that these people are
1:01:29 not just reading papers
1:01:30 and uh you know having fun but actually
1:01:33 so usually
1:01:34 yeah i would say the type c data
1:01:35 scientist would be perfect in that role
1:01:37 as well so
1:01:38 maybe a lot of that measurement goes
1:01:39 back to the actual tech
1:01:41 lead who's leading these data science
1:01:43 teams
1:01:45 because they they should be able to
1:01:46 translate what their team is doing
1:01:49 into dollars because i think that's
1:01:50 really important when we're thinking
1:01:52 about enterprise data science
1:01:55 yes uh we have quite a few questions and
1:01:59 i think now it's a good time to actually
1:02:01 go through these questions
1:02:02 and uh answer them
1:02:05 how anyone without any domain exp
1:02:08 expertise
1:02:09 can make a career in data science
1:02:12 okay so there are let's call them
1:02:16 like their their whole career is being
1:02:19 very good with the technical
1:02:20 but not having to dive deep into the
1:02:23 domain expertise because they are
1:02:25 consultants so
1:02:27 you could you could be a very very
1:02:28 successful data scientist working in a
1:02:30 consulting
1:02:31 company where you're moving from one
1:02:33 domain to another
1:02:34 so you essentially you don't necessarily
1:02:38 need to be very strong in a single
1:02:39 domain but you have to have skills where
1:02:41 you can
1:02:42 really skill up quickly in any domain
1:02:45 so that in itself is a very specialized
1:02:47 skill
1:02:48 and when we think of like the big three
1:02:51 like mckinsey bain
1:02:52 bcg type consultants that's what they're
1:02:54 doing they get sent
1:02:55 one day to a oil field the next day
1:02:57 they're going to
1:02:59 a farm for doing agriculture there's
1:03:01 it's very very broad
1:03:02 and they've started doing data science
1:03:04 within those spaces as well so
1:03:06 um definitely can be done but ideally
1:03:10 you would be very strong in at least one
1:03:12 domain
1:03:13 because you have to demonstrate that you
1:03:14 can learn about
1:03:16 something quickly and that's probably
1:03:18 the best way to do it is to demonstrate
1:03:19 your knowledge in one space
1:03:21 and that space can be technical space
1:03:23 like usually
1:03:27 can be i would say the domain expertise
1:03:29 is more around the
1:03:30 business domain i think technical
1:03:33 domains
1:03:34 can also you can also have
1:03:36 specializations
1:03:38 as opposed to the domain expertise like
1:03:40 let's say alex is very very good at
1:03:42 card computing and deep learning deep
1:03:45 learning on the cloud maybe his
1:03:46 specialization
1:03:49 hopefully that would also count as a
1:03:53 specialization where you don't
1:03:55 you don't necessarily need a lot of
1:03:56 domain expertise in any specific
1:03:58 business domain
1:04:00 as long as you can translate the
1:04:01 different problems into your technical
1:04:03 specification
1:04:05 or have a product manager or business
1:04:06 analysis yes who can help you
1:04:09 okay and the next question you probably
1:04:11 get it quite often
1:04:12 uh like how to break into data science
1:04:15 as a fresher
1:04:16 uh and uh that it's like two questions
1:04:20 in one and where and how to apply
1:04:23 okay we can tackle the applying one
1:04:27 because i think that's
1:04:28 an easier question to do there are two
1:04:30 schools of thought you either apply for
1:04:32 everywhere
1:04:32 or you apply for nowhere so let me
1:04:35 let me break this down if you apply for
1:04:37 everywhere you're essentially going
1:04:39 through the public channels you're going
1:04:40 through linkedin
1:04:42 um like the company website maybe going
1:04:45 through recruiters and different things
1:04:46 like that
1:04:47 that's applying everywhere the flip side
1:04:50 of that is
1:04:51 if you don't apply anywhere and you
1:04:54 literally just
1:04:55 only go through referral so
1:04:59 a lot of the it's difficult both ways
1:05:02 for people who are breaking into the
1:05:04 industry um there's just so much
1:05:06 competition
1:05:07 and the area is just so hot so the
1:05:10 those are the two different ways that
1:05:11 you can apply for these roles
1:05:13 but no one really talks about how you
1:05:15 get to the stage where you can start
1:05:17 applying or even getting referrals
1:05:19 so the most important thing for anyone
1:05:21 trying to break into data science would
1:05:22 be to
1:05:23 you essentially need a project portfolio
1:05:26 um
1:05:28 there's there's no other way essentially
1:05:30 not in this competition
1:05:32 not in this competitive environment um
1:05:35 it's either
1:05:36 if you're lucky lucky enough and your
1:05:38 company just happens to have an opening
1:05:40 for a data scientist
1:05:41 and you're in an adjacent team that you
1:05:43 can just kind of they give a chance to
1:05:45 you
1:05:45 to to jump into that data science team
1:05:47 like i did
1:05:49 you could be lucky very very rare
1:05:52 um most of the time people who are
1:05:55 coming into
1:05:56 data science they'll the data science
1:05:58 roles they want people with experience
1:06:00 otherwise they would they would just
1:06:02 hire someone else with experience
1:06:04 so the way to combat your lack of
1:06:06 experience is to demonstrate what you
1:06:08 can do
1:06:09 and one of the only ways that you can
1:06:11 demonstrate what you can do in a
1:06:12 quantifiable way
1:06:14 is to have a project that's public
1:06:17 that you can share with the recruiters
1:06:19 with people who might be in the hiring
1:06:21 management team or if you maybe you know
1:06:25 someone in the company who knows
1:06:26 other people so this is where your
1:06:28 network really comes in
1:06:30 but if you don't have a portfolio to
1:06:32 show someone
1:06:33 um it doesn't matter if you who you know
1:06:36 because they can't
1:06:37 they can't vouch for you essentially so
1:06:40 i would definitely say project portfolio
1:06:42 it with as best
1:06:44 programming standards as possible um try
1:06:47 to avoid
1:06:47 a lot of the common pitfalls that we see
1:06:50 a lot in
1:06:51 beginner projects um i can talk about
1:06:54 them a lot more but we'll
1:06:55 probably be here for a little bit i can
1:06:56 imagine what you talk about like this
1:06:59 jupiter notebook without comments where
1:07:00 you need to execute something in some
1:07:02 particular order
1:07:03 just dumped where without any yeah
1:07:05 comments without reading
1:07:07 out requirements.txt file things like
1:07:10 that right
1:07:11 yeah maybe we can do a future session
1:07:13 where it's like we'll just point out
1:07:14 like
1:07:15 common mistakes made by beginners on
1:07:16 their on their projects or different
1:07:18 things like that interesting
1:07:20 yeah and uh just a follow-up question
1:07:23 from me personally like if you if
1:07:26 somebody wants to break into
1:07:28 data science but they don't know like
1:07:29 should they go with type a
1:07:31 should they go with type b uh
1:07:34 do you think it's easier to go into type
1:07:37 a
1:07:38 data science job than type b or like or
1:07:41 can we even compare them can we even say
1:07:43 that it's easier or this is just
1:07:45 two separate things i think that um
1:07:49 it'll be down to luck and availability
1:07:51 of what's available for you to apply for
1:07:53 um when you're looking for the first job
1:07:55 so like
1:07:57 as bad as it sounds ideally if you had
1:07:59 skills in both you can apply for both
1:08:00 but
1:08:01 not many people are going to have the
1:08:03 time investment to actually learn all of
1:08:05 the different skills for type a and type
1:08:07 b
1:08:07 without a lot of work experience so
1:08:10 usually what i'd recommend is to
1:08:14 rely on your background so if you have a
1:08:16 software engineering background
1:08:18 it'll be much easier for you to actually
1:08:20 make it through as a type
1:08:21 type b but there's also like a there's
1:08:24 an
1:08:24 alternative side to that as well so
1:08:27 let's say you're a software engineer you
1:08:28 did
1:08:28 computer science uh as your undergrad if
1:08:31 you decided to go after an analyst role
1:08:34 you'll you'll be more competitive
1:08:36 because you're a strong programmer
1:08:37 compared to people who are not a strong
1:08:39 programmer
1:08:40 so that's like another perspective to
1:08:42 think about it so
1:08:44 um so it's not i wouldn't say that
1:08:46 there's a black and white you should do
1:08:47 this or you should do that
1:08:48 but just try and think think
1:08:50 strategically of
1:08:52 how you can use your skills to best
1:08:55 compete
1:08:55 in that sense um unfortunately it's just
1:08:58 how
1:08:59 the environment is just so competitive
1:09:01 and everyone is looking for jobs here
1:09:03 so but for let's say you're you're an
1:09:06 analyst type and you're hearing this and
1:09:07 you're like oh
1:09:08 damn i'm not very good at programming
1:09:10 how can i skill up
1:09:11 in programming so i can compete against
1:09:13 these other people
1:09:14 so that's like the catch-22 so
1:09:18 to be able to have a very strong
1:09:20 programming background
1:09:21 and develop it quickly uh usually those
1:09:24 things don't go
1:09:26 don't go hand in hand it takes a few
1:09:28 like takes a lot of time to become a
1:09:29 good developer
1:09:31 of course you can pick up really strong
1:09:32 fundamentals and start
1:09:34 with really good practices which always
1:09:36 helps but
1:09:37 time on the keyboard is time on the
1:09:39 keyboard
1:09:41 someone with two or three years more
1:09:43 technical experience will always have
1:09:45 stronger skills from the beginning
1:09:46 compared to someone without any
1:09:48 so it's just the play with the
1:09:51 cut with the cards that you're dealt
1:09:53 essentially but
1:09:54 you you shouldn't feel discouraged about
1:09:58 that
1:09:58 so when we think of the analytics teams
1:10:01 and the other things like that
1:10:02 a lot of people want to go straight into
1:10:05 a type a data science role
1:10:08 these type a data science roles are
1:10:10 actually more challenging than the type
1:10:12 b ones
1:10:13 because usually i would say you're
1:10:15 you're expected to live
1:10:17 to deliver value sooner
1:10:20 so let's say you're you're the first
1:10:22 data scientist within a company
1:10:24 you're not going to be a type b data
1:10:26 scientist usually because they won't
1:10:28 know what they're doing
1:10:29 so you'll be tasked with okay figure out
1:10:31 why our sales are down
1:10:33 we have no idea why sales are done and
1:10:35 you've got three weeks to do it
1:10:37 something like that something crazy so a
1:10:39 lot of
1:10:40 a lot of the time when you're doing
1:10:41 exploration usually
1:10:44 the best type a data scientists are more
1:10:46 senior
1:10:47 they they would have had a few more
1:10:48 years of experience working with data
1:10:52 and their their intuition around the
1:10:55 the data and the business is usually
1:10:57 higher
1:10:58 so i think for people when they're
1:11:00 starting off and you're working in an
1:11:02 analyst
1:11:03 or you're you come from an analytics
1:11:06 background or
1:11:06 not a software engineering background a
1:11:09 data analyst role is not a bad option
1:11:11 because you can actually skill up in a
1:11:12 lot of the things
1:11:14 which we traditionally think of as data
1:11:16 science skills you don't need to learn
1:11:17 them on the job
1:11:18 you can learn them on kaggle through
1:11:20 online courses through different things
1:11:22 like that
1:11:23 the most important thing when you're
1:11:24 starting off your career is being close
1:11:26 to the data
1:11:27 so the more you can use data using sql
1:11:29 tableau excel
1:11:31 doesn't really matter the more time you
1:11:32 spend with data the better
1:11:34 so i think a lot of people really
1:11:39 feel stressed about that like they oh if
1:11:41 i if i don't get a data scientist role i
1:11:43 don't know what i'm going to do
1:11:44 sort of thing like when they're starting
1:11:46 their career um
1:11:48 we shouldn't think like that i i think
1:11:50 if i if i thought like that when i
1:11:52 started my career i'd probably still be
1:11:53 waiting for my first role
1:11:56 i think a lot of people are probably
1:11:59 thinking the same thing too
1:12:01 yeah so like a short answer it depends
1:12:05 depends on your background right the
1:12:07 wrong answer is what you just
1:12:09 gave it would be like depends on your on
1:12:12 your background then
1:12:13 your strategy of how you want to do it
1:12:16 um
1:12:17 and i think it just depends on what your
1:12:19 interest is
1:12:21 how dedicated you are to whatever you
1:12:23 want to do
1:12:26 what is your opinion about bootcamps
1:12:28 like is it possible to break into data
1:12:30 science
1:12:31 type a or type b data science from a
1:12:34 bootcamp these days i think it's going
1:12:37 to be rarer
1:12:38 um
1:12:41 i would say that so there's there's
1:12:44 definitely very high quality
1:12:45 online training material out there um
1:12:48 like you've got the guys at super data
1:12:50 science who are doing some amazing stuff
1:12:52 um and they're trying to build out
1:12:54 certifications which
1:12:55 people can use to validate their skills
1:12:57 and use it to get jobs i think that's
1:12:59 really awesome
1:13:00 um a lot of the boot camps i would say
1:13:04 be careful um of course there's they're
1:13:07 always going to have really strong
1:13:09 marketing they'll tell you about their
1:13:11 staff pupils who landed a job in
1:13:13 facebook google amazon etc
1:13:15 after they took a six-week bootcamp with
1:13:17 no coding experience before
1:13:20 and i would i would say that those
1:13:22 things actually happen as well
1:13:24 but they are rare um don't i would not
1:13:27 think that that's the average or the
1:13:29 mean they're probably outliers
1:13:33 and i feel that it's it's very difficult
1:13:36 to teach
1:13:36 all of this stuff in six weeks like you
1:13:38 can't really time box
1:13:40 learning data science it should be like
1:13:42 a long long
1:13:43 journey like i'm i've been learning data
1:13:45 science for who knows how long like five
1:13:47 six years or something i still don't
1:13:49 know what i'm doing there's
1:13:51 like there's always something new to
1:13:52 learn um so
1:13:55 boot camps are good if you have the time
1:13:57 and the money and
1:13:58 you're really willing to focus for that
1:14:00 12 weeks or whatever
1:14:02 and work your ass off like i think
1:14:04 they're really really valuable and
1:14:05 they're good
1:14:06 incentive devices to actually do that um
1:14:09 when you do it do a lot of research
1:14:11 reach out to people who have taken those
1:14:12 boot camps
1:14:13 to get their feedback find out how they
1:14:16 were doing
1:14:18 if they have alumni that you can reach
1:14:19 out to and learn a bit more
1:14:22 like definitely do as much research as
1:14:24 you can and don't dive into something
1:14:27 in the spur of the moment and end up
1:14:28 paying too much for something that you
1:14:31 in the end might regret so just do do as
1:14:34 much research as you can
1:14:36 i think it's a perfect segue to talk
1:14:37 about your course because you mentioned
1:14:39 that like it's not like
1:14:42 it took you a couple of years to learn
1:14:44 that uh what you know so it's not
1:14:46 possible to put it
1:14:47 uh like to cram everything into six
1:14:49 weeks or twelve weeks or whatever
1:14:51 um yet you are uh
1:14:55 like i i don't want to say you're trying
1:14:57 to to to do this but uh like you also
1:14:59 see a problem there with
1:15:01 bootcamps with education with all these
1:15:04 amounts
1:15:04 of information that we have around so
1:15:06 you decided that
1:15:08 you want to create a course so maybe you
1:15:10 can tell us a bit more about the course
1:15:11 so what the course is
1:15:13 for which type of the data scientist it
1:15:15 is and
1:15:16 things like that definitely so
1:15:19 i recently launched the data with danny
1:15:22 virtual data apprenticeship program
1:15:24 so and as part of that the first part of
1:15:28 that program is my serious
1:15:30 sql course where i'm trying to
1:15:33 essentially train everyone in all the
1:15:36 different
1:15:36 skills that i've picked up over the past
1:15:38 few years working in sql
1:15:42 and so my vision for the online course
1:15:45 business was it was actually really
1:15:47 interesting because when i started doing
1:15:49 all of these things i
1:15:50 actually didn't want to sell a course at
1:15:52 all because i thought that it was
1:15:53 there were ethical issues with charging
1:15:55 people money for something which they
1:15:57 can learn for free
1:15:58 um like would people even pay for
1:16:01 something that i'm creating or different
1:16:03 things like that like all the regular
1:16:04 doubts that people have also
1:16:07 but in the end i i figured that the way
1:16:10 that i learned
1:16:11 my skills was directly through my
1:16:13 mentals
1:16:14 it wasn't learning directly from the
1:16:16 documentation or
1:16:19 working on of course working on learning
1:16:20 from the documentation and working on
1:16:22 challenging projects of course that
1:16:24 helped but the most important thing was
1:16:26 actually to work really closely with a
1:16:28 mentor
1:16:29 and this mentor they might have been an
1:16:31 expert in certain areas but they also
1:16:33 had things that they didn't know
1:16:34 themselves as well
1:16:36 so it was kind of like a learning
1:16:37 journey between the both of us than when
1:16:39 we were working together
1:16:41 so in the same way i wanted to create
1:16:43 that same sort of learning experience
1:16:46 for not just for data scientists but for
1:16:48 anyone who's starting their data journey
1:16:50 so my belief is that so sql is going to
1:16:54 be
1:16:54 a huge thing for when people are going
1:16:56 to be accessing data
1:16:58 um and then the next few things i wanted
1:17:00 to teach was more around data
1:17:02 visualization
1:17:02 data manipulation forecasting time
1:17:05 series machine learning
1:17:06 all of these things but the first thing
1:17:09 that i chose was to do
1:17:10 sql because i think that's how that was
1:17:13 personally how i learned how to do a lot
1:17:15 of the data problem solving
1:17:16 was by using sql only i felt that having
1:17:19 strong sql skills is very important
1:17:21 just to understand data like it's very
1:17:24 it's almost like the natural language of
1:17:27 how we use data doesn't matter what
1:17:28 language like usually we translate it
1:17:31 back to some sort of sql
1:17:32 concept as well but yeah i've i just
1:17:36 launched my serious sql course the
1:17:39 it's in live beta now so parts of it are
1:17:42 still undone
1:17:43 i need to work really hard to actually
1:17:45 finish them on time for the real launch
1:17:48 but i've i had a waitlist before and
1:17:52 i was i've also launched it on facebook
1:17:55 oh no
1:17:56 not on facebook on linkedin and
1:17:58 different places and the price is
1:17:59 currently 29
1:18:01 u.s there is a student price out there
1:18:03 as well
1:18:04 so if you're if you're a student and
1:18:06 you're tuning in please listen in
1:18:08 or please reach out to me on slack or
1:18:10 send me an email um
1:18:12 the email will be support data with
1:18:15 danny.com
1:18:16 um and i can show you directly
1:18:20 but the yeah the whole the whole thing
1:18:22 with the serious sql courses is to
1:18:24 essentially
1:18:25 go through as many of the fundamental
1:18:27 skills as possible
1:18:29 but also use those skills to solve as
1:18:31 close to real life projects as
1:18:33 possible based off my experience so
1:18:35 there'll be
1:18:36 a lot of technical projects lots of case
1:18:39 studies
1:18:40 and the focus is more on how do we solve
1:18:43 different problems
1:18:44 so there's a section which i'm going to
1:18:46 be adding more and more
1:18:48 interview questions and case studies and
1:18:49 different things like that to really
1:18:51 help people
1:18:52 apply their skills to get the job or to
1:18:54 start building their project portfolio
1:18:55 as well
1:18:56 so if anyone's interested please reach
1:18:58 out to me yeah
1:19:00 datawithdaney.com right
1:19:02 datawithdanny.com
1:19:04 yes so there is a question that uh that
1:19:06 is quite related what is
1:19:08 the complete roadmap for became becoming
1:19:10 a data scientist
1:19:11 and i think if somebody goes to your
1:19:14 website so like
1:19:15 dating with dyna it's not just this uh
1:19:17 sql one sql course there is like a
1:19:19 learning path actually
1:19:20 that starts with sql as a fundamental
1:19:22 skill like you mentioned
1:19:23 that you also mentioned databasation
1:19:25 forecasting machine learning
1:19:27 what else is there in this roadmap like
1:19:29 what else people should learn
1:19:31 to become a data scientist in your
1:19:32 opinion so
1:19:35 if you're starting from from fresh from
1:19:37 scratch and you have never
1:19:39 oh sorry ate a bit too much food earlier
1:19:41 if you
1:19:42 if you've never used data before i would
1:19:45 recommend sql first
1:19:47 it's a very natural way to learn how to
1:19:49 use data
1:19:50 then from there i would say start
1:19:52 learning one of the popular
1:19:54 programming languages for data science
1:19:56 so this could be r or python
1:19:59 so the vision for my next course is to
1:20:02 essentially
1:20:03 teach data visualization a bit of
1:20:05 statistics forecasting
1:20:06 and data manipulation but in both
1:20:08 languages at the same time
1:20:10 because it's very very useful to
1:20:13 actually be able to
1:20:14 do both i think the learning experience
1:20:15 will be very positive
1:20:17 it will be very challenging of course
1:20:19 but hopefully we'll make it happen
1:20:21 um but i think for for the
1:20:24 the more you know the more opportunities
1:20:27 it really opens
1:20:28 up to you so it's very good to know both
1:20:31 i would say those are the core skills
1:20:33 so it doesn't matter if you do r or
1:20:35 python or both but
1:20:36 you'll definitely need to have strong
1:20:38 data visualization
1:20:40 analysis skills hopefully
1:20:42 experimentation as well so some like a b
1:20:44 testing
1:20:46 how do you define metrics conversion
1:20:48 metrics and different things like that
1:20:50 um and a little bit of forecasting just
1:20:52 enough to know what you need to do
1:20:54 for 90 of most of the problems i think
1:20:57 that is the next step
1:20:58 that was my natural step as well when i
1:21:00 was going through my journey
1:21:02 go working towards a data scientist role
1:21:05 and then after that
1:21:06 we'll probably focus on some of the more
1:21:07 traditional machine learning
1:21:09 algorithms so your logistic regression
1:21:12 linear regression decision trees
1:21:16 random forests boosted trees before we
1:21:19 start going into the deep learning
1:21:21 because i think when we think of the
1:21:24 machine learning algorithms and how we
1:21:25 do the measurement
1:21:26 and how do we do the optimization of all
1:21:28 the different hyper parameters
1:21:30 it's much easier when we think of it in
1:21:32 the traditional machine learning sense
1:21:34 and with some of these algorithms as
1:21:36 well like my plan is to
1:21:38 actually get people to implement it
1:21:40 using base python for example
1:21:42 or at least using numpy's and i wanted
1:21:46 to also
1:21:47 cover maybe julia as well so
1:21:50 i was hoping the machine learning thing
1:21:52 will be in python and julia
1:21:53 ideally um that'll be fun and then
1:21:57 after the traditional machine learning i
1:21:59 think that's when the deep learning
1:22:00 comes in so you might want to learn
1:22:02 about um all the base level of the deep
1:22:05 learning
1:22:06 like your neural networks all the
1:22:08 different layers that you could use in
1:22:10 your model
1:22:11 um some of the new architecture that's
1:22:13 coming out so
1:22:14 you've got like transformers are coming
1:22:15 out attention networks
1:22:17 there's a whole lot of stuff and it's
1:22:19 always rapidly evolving so probably by
1:22:21 the time i get around to actually making
1:22:23 that course
1:22:24 all of what i've said now is probably
1:22:25 going to be made redundant
1:22:27 but i think it'll be a very exciting
1:22:29 space to work in
1:22:30 but i wouldn't recommend people dive
1:22:33 into deep learning straight away from
1:22:34 day one
1:22:36 they're very useful but once you start
1:22:40 using them you shouldn't
1:22:41 see them as the hammer or you shouldn't
1:22:43 be a hammer and everything looks like a
1:22:45 nail sort of thing
1:22:47 yes thanks danny so i think we're
1:22:50 almost uh uh okay like because the next
1:22:54 talk will start in five minutes we
1:22:56 should be right back
1:22:58 yes and you must be tired uh talking for
1:23:00 one hour no i'm fine
1:23:01 no yeah you're used to this but maybe i
1:23:04 could question
1:23:04 you yeah a quick question to you because
1:23:06 i think i know what you're going to
1:23:08 answer but
1:23:11 in your opinion how important it is for
1:23:13 a data science position to have
1:23:15 a master's degree or a phd oh
1:23:19 so i would say different data science
1:23:22 positions would have different
1:23:23 requirements
1:23:24 so if you're let's say you're working in
1:23:26 machine learning research
1:23:28 where you're developing a new algorithm
1:23:30 or you're running some clinical
1:23:33 tests or something with machine learning
1:23:35 or something very research heavy
1:23:38 ideally you'd have a master's or a phd
1:23:40 because you have a lot of experience
1:23:41 doing those sorts of things reading a
1:23:44 lot of math
1:23:45 and just being able to handle a lot of
1:23:47 complexity like that's what you're
1:23:49 trained for
1:23:50 um so i would say anything which is in
1:23:52 that realm so
1:23:53 if you think of like the machine
1:23:55 learning engineering teams of
1:23:56 amazon facebook google any of the big
1:23:58 tech companies
1:23:59 that's why they usually prefer people
1:24:01 with a master's or a phd
1:24:04 but for for most other roles in the
1:24:06 industry
1:24:08 they are not in that realm like you
1:24:10 wouldn't have to
1:24:12 design a whole new layer of a neural
1:24:13 network or something
1:24:16 to solve some marketing problem or
1:24:18 something like that so
1:24:20 i would say that it's not going to be
1:24:21 required that you have a master's or a
1:24:23 phd
1:24:24 but it of course i think it definitely
1:24:26 helps if you've got like a master's in
1:24:27 computer science or masters in
1:24:29 mathematics or
1:24:30 statistics or something it will
1:24:32 definitely help but
1:24:33 for people who are making the decision
1:24:35 of whether you do further education
1:24:38 it's a trade-off between how much time
1:24:40 can you spend doing that education are
1:24:42 you able to do it part-time full-time
1:24:45 whilst you're working on a job as well
1:24:47 like ideally you would
1:24:49 for me like i i haven't got a master's
1:24:51 or a phd but i've got a lot of industry
1:24:53 experience working on lots of different
1:24:55 problems
1:24:56 most of my mentors actually have phds or
1:24:59 masters but they
1:25:00 told me instead of doing my further
1:25:02 study they just told me to
1:25:04 go read the books that are on the like
1:25:06 the course recommended thing you might
1:25:08 learn more than
1:25:08 actually doing the degree yeah but i
1:25:12 would say it's not recommend like
1:25:13 not not always needed but
1:25:17 it would help for sure okay
1:25:20 thanks i think that is it thanks a lot
1:25:23 for coming for sharing
1:25:24 uh all your knowledge and you have
1:25:27 shared a lot during this half
1:25:29 uh one hour and a half that was uh an
1:25:32 insane amount of
1:25:32 information so thanks a lot uh thanks
1:25:35 everyone for watching and asking
1:25:37 questions
1:25:38 we will now have a small break and
1:25:41 uh danny you are free to go thanks a lot
1:25:44 again
1:25:45 thank you so much for having me on yes
1:25:47 thanks and
