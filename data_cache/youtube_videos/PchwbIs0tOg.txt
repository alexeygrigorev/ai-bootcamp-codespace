2:52 talk about accelerating the job hunt for
2:54 the perfect job in Tech and today today
2:58 we have a special guest s Sarah is a
3:00 data scientist and a certified career
3:03 and interview coach she has over 6 years
3:06 of experience working in Tech in working
3:09 at generational companies financial
3:11 companies and
3:13 startups she went through a career
3:16 transition
3:17 yourself and she also wants to support
3:21 women other women in following their

3:33 women to find the right job for
3:35 them so as a career coach she has been
3:38 supporting women getting back to work
3:40 after a career break and Women in
3:42 Transition to the data field and today
3:44 we'll probably talk more about that and
3:45 in general about finding the perfect job
3:50 so welcome to our interview sir thank
3:52 you Alexa for having me guest at your
3:56 channel I'm very pleased to be part of
3:59 of it yeah thanks thanks for for
4:02 accepting the invite so the question for
4:04 today's interview are prepared by Johan
4:07 buyer thanks Johanna for your help and
4:10 let's start so before we go into our
4:12 main topic or of finding a good job
4:16 let's start with your background I
4:18 already mentioned a couple of things but
4:21 maybe can you tell us more about your
4:23 career Journey so far yeah so sure so I
4:26 have a background in a computer science
4:29 engineer in so I studied in Tunisia
4:32 before moving to Berlin and um I worked
4:37 uh few years as a fullstack developer uh
4:41 before transitioning to data science as
4:43 you said like I I did a career
4:46 transition myself and since
4:49 2018 I have been working as a data
4:52 scientist at Remer which is uh an app um
4:57 a company for app mobile app
5:01 retargeting so it helps uh people um use
5:05 the apps again the mobile apps again uh
5:09 by displaying ads
5:12 in yeah I I have already worked in um
5:15 the at Tech space but uh so correct me
5:18 if I'm wrong so let's say I play a game
5:22 right and then I something happens and I
5:25 forget about this game right I stop
5:27 playing it and then what you do is you
5:31 see me in some other app and you say hey
5:35 like do you remember this game that you
5:37 played come back exactly yeah so that's
5:40 retargeting yeah that's the the main
5:44 area where Remer started and then uh we
5:47 also started user acquisition uh recent
5:50 last year so yeah that's where uh I
5:54 started in data science and still work
5:56 uh at remerge and at the same time about
6:00 after having my first child I decided I
6:04 was like okay I want to do something
6:06 during my parent leave and so on because
6:10 I I needed to find something for myself
6:14 and that's where I started doing um
6:17 started the journey into my own project
6:19 which is thriving career months uh where
6:22 I started helping mom's returning to
6:24 work after maternity and then until the
6:27 like recently I also started to support
6:30 women in Tech or women in career
6:32 transition so not necessarily only
6:35 months yeah and yeah that's um a little
6:40 bit more if you have more question about
6:42 my journey then yeah but how exactly did
6:49 you did you realize that okay I not only
6:53 I want to help women get back to work
6:56 after a career after a break but you
6:59 also decided to like become a coach like
7:02 what did you do which steps like from
7:04 the moment you realized that okay like I
7:06 have some knowledge about that and I
7:08 want to share it to actually get in your
7:10 first M te like what was the journey go
7:14 yeah so the secret here is because I
7:17 have been um having the support of a
7:20 coach along my journey when I decided to
7:24 transition to data science I joined the
7:27 community and there I got to support on
7:30 how to go through my career transition
7:33 and then uh the same time when also
7:37 another time when I decided to start my
7:40 own project I got the help of that same
7:42 Community which is classic career
7:45 girl uh and um yeah I followed the steps
7:48 I was like I take the first action and
7:50 then okay here's some opportunity let me
7:52 have a membership and then okay not to
7:54 membership let's do something else so I
7:57 kept trying doing different things and
8:00 with the support of my coach with the
8:02 support of of my community Where I
8:04 Belong um yeah I could really come up
8:08 with uh a product a service and start
8:12 career coaching and having my own
8:15 coaches yeah
8:17 MH and when it comes to defining a
8:21 figuring out what is your Niche where
8:24 you can help like at the beginning did
8:26 you already know what exactly you want
8:27 to help or or was it something you
8:30 needed to work out
8:32 and understand and eventually um yeah I
8:37 understand say that okay I want to help
8:39 moms right yeah and that's I think a
8:42 process that I'm still going through it
8:45 until this date because you you keep
8:47 okay now is this the right Niche is this
8:51 uh however I know from like I want to
8:54 support women in the beginning so for
8:56 example I had like I want to support uh
8:58 other women because I have my own St
9:01 like from my own journey I know that uh
9:05 we Face some certain challenges so I and
9:09 I feel C to support women but then okay
9:12 is it like moms is it women intake is it
9:15 women transitioning to data and uh yeah
9:19 that's I'm still working on this uh with
9:23 step by step small
9:26 steps so what is or what are the most
9:30 common things that your
9:33 clients come to you with like what do
9:36 they what kind of problems do they have
9:37 that they need to your help
9:40 with uh well they need to usually they
9:43 are looking for a new job or they are
9:46 starting I also help with someone who
9:48 started a new job so started a new job
9:50 but they don't have a specific goal so I
9:54 was like okay supporting them in the
9:56 first months but most of them are career
9:59 charges and looking for a new
10:02 job
10:04 yeah it's which is exactly the topic for
10:06 today's c yeah yeah and we talked about
10:09 that in our lunch networking lunch
10:13 that's why the idea
10:15 guess yeah so for those there's a bit of
10:19 a story so we met I think it was in
10:22 November so in Berlin in data talks club
10:27 we have regular meetings so breakfasts
10:31 lunches dinners and we met on one of
10:34 these lunches on one of the meetings and
10:37 interestingly along with Sarah there was
10:40 her client yeah so and that for me was
10:45 super interesting that's why we are
10:47 talking right now so it took some time
10:48 to arrange
10:51 everything yeah so it was uh it was
10:54 really interesting lunch he's also
10:56 carrier censor to data m yeah
11:01 so clients come to you and ask you to
11:05 help them with finding a new job a new
11:08 job so what happens after we have the
11:11 first call so how exactly do you help
11:13 them um to find this perfect job for
11:17 their
11:19 Ambitions okay um wait so uh the way I
11:23 help them is um through taking them
11:27 through the process which is uh four
11:30 pillars the first pillar is about Job SE
11:33 so helping them getting clear about
11:36 their ideal job description so we see
11:41 jobs online but which jobs are you
11:44 really interesting to be
11:47 doing what problems are you interested
11:49 to be solving and what's your vision for
11:52 the next future so that's uh the thing
11:56 that we we go through uh first
12:00 uh and then uh it's about having a
12:03 networking strategy and uh knowing which
12:08 people are you going to reach out
12:10 to so that uh you have increase your
12:14 chances for a referral for knowing about
12:18 the right
12:19 opportunity and uh then it's about uh
12:23 the resume and interview
12:26 preparation uh which is about how to
12:29 tailor your resume how to uh use the
12:33 correct keywords and how to show the
12:36 value that you provide to the
12:38 company and then how can you also
12:41 Express that in interviews so preparing
12:44 for the top questions uh like for
12:47 example why are you applying for this
12:49 company what makes you interested to
12:51 apply here why are you leaving your job
12:54 why did you change your career and so on
12:59 and then the fourth pillar is the job
13:02 search strategy which is about the main
13:04 job uh search activities that one is
13:08 going to um two enter theate
13:14 job yeah this sounds like it's not
13:17 really specific to data science it
13:19 applies to any sort of job and if we
13:23 talk about data so it can be like data
13:24 analyst data engineer uh whatever right
13:28 it's very
13:30 broad so four pillars
13:34 okay so you said the first pillar is job
13:38 search okay four pillars job search
13:41 networking strategy CV and interview
13:43 preparation and
13:45 job search
13:48 strategy like is the first and the last
13:50 one are the same okay let me uh do I'm
13:55 just wondering because I think that's
13:59 the questions that yeah I I
14:03 don't I don't know if you have the same
14:07 document that I have just because I
14:09 remember this I changed it a little bit
14:11 so we can really focus on the okay I'm a
14:15 bit not following the document on this
14:18 for those who edit this episode later
14:20 please cut this out for who listening
14:23 yeah bear with us so you prefer to
14:27 follow the questions right um yeah yeah
14:30 yeah okay so we talked about these four
14:33 pillars right and then um you said that
14:37 the first thing is job search right so
14:39 you need to have clear idea like you
14:42 need to know what is your ideal job is a
14:45 job description yeah idea and which jobs
14:48 are interesting for you and where you
14:51 want to be in the future so how do you
14:54 know that whether a job description is
14:58 100% aligned with my ambition like is
15:01 this the job is this the job that I'm
15:03 looking at right now right for
15:06 me yeah I think that's one thing that
15:09 all my clients who come they think for
15:12 example they know what they are looking
15:14 for for example let's say here to be
15:16 concrete I'm looking for a data
15:19 scientist
15:20 job but then okay data scientist can do
15:24 many things right so even the the titles
15:28 are different you can find for example
15:30 decision making scientist you can find
15:33 applied research scientist and all of
15:35 them they they can be put under data
15:39 science so the first step is that I help
15:42 them to figure out that and how how to
15:45 know this is the right like uh
15:50 alignment is by having knowing what
15:54 skills do you want to develop right now
15:57 so to go about it is first researching
16:01 so what we do is like first researching
16:04 all these data Sciences jobs online
16:07 advertisement you look at the
16:09 advertisement and then okay these are
16:11 you will find some tasks that you enjoy
16:14 you you are interested in doing so you
16:16 start to collect okay these tasks I like
16:18 to do these now this technology I'm
16:21 interested to to learn about it this
16:24 technology not so this is part of
16:27 research and uh the job description but
16:31 not only that the other thing is doing
16:34 connecting with people who are doing the
16:36 job so let's say I found I found um
16:41 that's last time I found a Flink so
16:44 that's by example like playing that have
16:46 uh uh job advertisement for data
16:50 scientist then I see is there
16:52 any uh people that I can connect with
16:56 who work it at the company or are
16:59 currently working at fling so that I can
17:02 uh ask them about how is it to work
17:05 there what do you do on your on a daily
17:07 day-to-day
17:09 basis and this uh helps to discover the
17:13 alignment exactly by going through the
17:16 process of researching talking to doing
17:18 informational interviews which is a
17:20 strategy that I really like because it
17:23 gives you another perspective I used it
17:26 myself when I was doing my care career
17:28 transition and even as I look at how I
17:31 want to grow further in my position I I
17:34 do informational interviews with
17:36 different people so that I figure out
17:39 what would be the thing that is right
17:42 for
17:46 me yeah and I'm a bit sidet tracking Sid
17:49 tracking again so yes it's fine I hope
17:52 it's fine so the problem that I
17:56 personally have not me personally but
17:58 like the problem
18:00 that let me take a step back so in our
18:03 community we have courses right so right
18:05 now we have three courses free different
18:06 courses so ml engineering course data
18:09 engineering course and mops course while
18:11 the first and the last one are kind of
18:13 similar the data engineering course is
18:16 quite different so it's a different kind
18:17 of job right so then people take all
18:20 these courses so they take the
18:21 engineering the data engineering course
18:23 the ml engineering course and they say
18:25 okay I like all the courses M all of
18:29 them right what's the third so ml
18:31 engineering data engineering and the
18:33 third mops mops okay okay so and then
18:37 the students come and say like we took
18:39 the courses and we like all of them and
18:42 I want to do all of this stuff right and
18:44 this is a lot right so you cannot be you
18:46 cannot like you can but like it's
18:48 difficult to be a jack of all trades
18:50 right especially if you're only starting
18:51 your career and you you need to figure
18:53 out what exactly from these
18:57 directions where exactly do I want to go
19:00 and what sometimes happens
19:03 is the students just apply to everything
19:06 right so they apply to data engineering
19:07 position mlops position ml engineering
19:10 positions like all of them right yeah
19:14 like I am not sure if it's a good thing
19:17 or a bad thing maybe you can tell us but
19:20 I think one of the consequences of that
19:22 that you kind of lose focus right yeah
19:25 exactly so how in this situation when
19:28 there are so many options and because um
19:31 like if I try to focus then it means
19:34 that I
19:36 am kind of how to say losing
19:40 opportunities like I have this fear of
19:42 missing out that if I don't apply to
19:44 data engineering positions then like
19:46 there's a very big chunk of potential
19:49 jobs that I will not get because I don't
19:52 apply to them right so if I only apply
19:54 to ml engineering positions so how in
19:57 this case can I actually understand
19:59 which one is better and what is better
20:01 for me okay yeah the first thing so
20:07 taking the courses all the courses to
20:09 explore is good because one doesn't have
20:12 experience in the field so exploring
20:15 different um uh
20:18 specializations is uh a good way to
20:21 start but what I would suggest to do
20:25 before before starting to do courses
20:27 okay now we are we I will talk about
20:30 those who already do the course but
20:32 before doing the courses and start doing
20:35 like applying for jobs take some times
20:38 and reflect on your profile what do you
20:42 have as uh as skills what do you have as
20:47 strengths and what do you have as uh
20:50 qualifications of course qualifications
20:53 strengths skills and then what do you
20:55 have as experience so taking into
20:59 consideration all of these in addition
21:01 to them also the interests why this is
21:05 um so this is this allows
21:08 you to uh better leverage okay from I
21:13 have my profile now uh which one of
21:16 these like data engineering ml Ops or ml
21:20 engineer would
21:23 be the the one that works for me first I
21:27 would be applying the skills that I
21:29 would like I enjoy and I can become good
21:33 at because I am enjoying then I can
21:36 become good at so which ones uh fit
21:39 better based on also my experience as
21:42 well so a combination of your profile
21:45 what makes you unique what makes you you
21:47 and then okay from there let's look uh
21:50 research these positions what does a
21:53 data engineer do what does ML Ops
21:56 engineer ml Ops do and what an ml
21:59 engineer
22:00 does once I do
22:03 that then I choose one of these and now
22:07 it's time to address okay but I'm not
22:10 sure yet like I don't have much
22:13 experience in it um all of them sound
22:16 interesting I want to work with data
22:18 many people say I I just want to work
22:20 with data I'm interested to work with
22:23 data what I would uh advise then still
22:27 try to choose a focus so let's say uh no
22:32 no okay choose a focus but maybe okay
22:34 how do you choose it try to see the
22:37 market job market if all of them are
22:40 interesting to you then look at the job
22:44 market what what does the job market say
22:47 maybe are are there more like hiring
22:50 data Engineers are they hiring more
22:54 mlops uh what's your target salary so
22:58 the target environment so study it from
23:02 the point of the job market this will
23:05 help to filter okay and from those it
23:08 sounds like the data engineering uh with
23:11 my scales and my profile what I want to
23:15 do like the work environment the the job
23:18 market and so on this one fits better
23:21 and from there choose a focus why a
23:23 focus is not going and now I want to
23:26 answer the question of
23:28 uh uh why the focus is not going to make
23:32 you lose
23:34 opportunities because when you focus you
23:37 simply uh give yourself the opportunity
23:42 to grow your skills in that specific
23:46 area and uh a mistake I did myself when
23:51 I decided to to change to data science
23:53 because I have the background of full
23:55 stack developer and I have like I worked
23:58 with Java I worked with back end front
24:00 end so actually I was like and I decided
24:03 to move to Berlin I know I want to be in
24:06 data science but I still wasn't clear
24:09 for me okay data science ml engineer
24:11 data scientist it wasn't clear at that
24:13 time to me but I what I did in the
24:16 beginning is I started to apply for all
24:18 jobs fullstack developer backend
24:20 developer backand engineer software
24:23 engineer data scientist ml engineer and
24:26 I got over with eled like how can I do
24:30 prepare for the interviews for all of
24:32 these they have different uh
24:35 requirements a data
24:37 scientist job would require other skills
24:42 than a full stock developer a data
24:45 engineer would require more skills than
24:48 a data scientist also although they can
24:52 have like an intersection in some points
24:55 but the focus the main focus would be
24:57 different from from data science data
24:59 engineer so I could I was getting lost
25:02 not getting any
25:05 um opportunities to have interviews uh
25:08 rejections what can I do and so on
25:12 until I narrow it down my focus and
25:15 that's when I started to become more
25:18 confident more ready for the interviews
25:20 I could have specific plan forar
25:23 learning and I started to get interviews
25:26 although I I narrow it down I was like
25:29 data scientist and I remember also ml
25:31 engineer I kept it as as a a data
25:35 scientist and ml engineer for me and
25:38 that was my
25:39 focus so yeah that's the focus doesn't
25:44 really um reduce your chances and yeah
25:48 and another thing I don't know another
25:51 thing is that companies want want some
25:54 people that have experience so if you
25:57 keep applying for all of
25:59 these courses at the end you are
26:01 applying for data engineer ml engineer
26:04 data scientist then the company who is
26:07 hiring for a data engineer which
26:10 requires more
26:11 infra infrastructure and tooling and
26:14 like preparation of the
26:16 data workflow and so on they will not
26:19 find you having that um practice of data
26:23 engine because you are trying to do all
26:24 of them yeah so which means that um
26:29 let's say somebody wants to take our
26:32 courses they should do some of this work
26:34 even before they take courses right yeah
26:36 yeah exactly then you have more Focus
26:39 from the very beginning and you know
26:40 okay I want to focus on data engineering
26:42 so I take data
26:44 engineering and then uh yeah just after
26:48 the course perhaps instead of taking the
26:49 other courses focus on developing the
26:52 skills in this area focus on doing more
26:54 projects in this area exactly and then
26:57 get interviews in that area right and
27:00 try to understand where you stand what
27:02 else is needed required to get a job
27:05 hopefully after finishing our course you
27:07 get all the skills right yeah yeah but
27:10 sometimes some companies might require
27:13 something specific right that we don't
27:15 cover and then this is where you can
27:18 understand that okay yeah and then try
27:20 to focus on I know building a project
27:23 with this particular skill yeah it's
27:25 it's important to not get lost in doing
27:28 all the courses I don't know if if
27:29 really all of them do all uh all the
27:32 courses before starting a new course
27:34 just take some time and okay maybe have
27:37 a project even if so I finish data
27:40 engineering I do a project I do a a
27:43 project and I see if I enjoy doing it
27:46 okay I I suppose the hypothesis is
27:49 something that I would like but okay I
27:51 finish data engineering let me practice
27:54 let me show that I developed skills in
27:57 data
27:59 engineering and then think about another
28:02 course but going from uh one course to
28:06 another
28:07 is like I don't know the wor but yeah
28:11 it's better to avoid it like especially
28:14 like that's circle like you get on the
28:16 train of course after course after
28:19 course because I feel like I still don't
28:20 have enough qualifications but remember
28:24 you have also skills you have strs you
28:27 have experience
28:29 so don't forget about
28:32 that and when it comes to having even
28:35 more Focus cuz like okay we you
28:38 mentioned that when it comes to data
28:40 science it's such a broad topic it can
28:43 mean anything from analysts to hardcore
28:47 deep learning whatever right
28:50 um and when you read one job description
28:54 for data scientist it can be super
28:56 different from another description of
28:58 data scientist and the same thing with
29:00 data Engineers so you can be a data
29:01 engineer that builds a data platform you
29:04 can be a data engineer that helps
29:06 analyst you can be a data engineer that
29:08 works with data scientists right so
29:10 there are also
29:14 speci and like do if I already know okay
29:18 I want to do data science or I want to
29:19 do data engineering do I already should
29:23 I already have even more focus and think
29:26 okay like I want to focus on this
29:28 particular type of data science job or
29:31 it's okay here at this point to be
29:33 rather
29:34 broad okay yeah because it's already if
29:37 you choose to focus on data engineering
29:39 there are different demands from company
29:42 another thing that is in the first
29:44 pillar that I've talked about which is
29:46 the job
29:48 description is not only getting clear
29:52 about that job description show the
29:53 things that you want to do the title
29:55 that you want Target title
29:58 but also the companies so what are the
30:01 companies that you want to be
30:03 working at so choose the companies and
30:07 see Al Al this the same thing this is by
30:10 research information interview
30:13 researching and from there you come up
30:16 with a list of let's say five five 10
30:19 companies maximum that you I would say a
30:22 list of five a list of five is enough
30:25 these are my top five companies that I
30:27 want to work uh there and from there you
30:30 see okay these companies um what are the
30:33 profiles of the data scientist there uh
30:36 can I um network with them start to okay
30:40 let me get closer know what they are
30:42 doing information interviews and uh uh
30:45 see what what problems that they are
30:48 trying to
30:49 solve the team of data engineer data
30:52 scientist all the company because every
30:54 company shares its mission it's purpose
30:58 what we are doing this is our product
31:00 and so on so there is already a lot of
31:02 information available
31:04 publicly publicly there is a lot of
31:07 information available so use that
31:09 information in order to help you know
31:14 what are the projects that you need to
31:17 uh practice what are the problems that
31:19 you need to practice solving and um
31:23 coming up with uh practical experience
31:26 in those uh problems and then also
31:28 networking with the people who work at
31:30 this company because that's another
31:32 layer layer in the job search which is
31:35 the
31:36 networking yeah does it answer your
31:39 question at least yeah it does focus in
31:41 the you mentioned the word networking
31:43 like 10 times by now so I think we
31:46 should talk about that now what what I
31:48 mention 10 times the companies no no no
31:51 networking the word network it's one of
31:54 the pillars but even before we go to
31:57 this networking pillar right it's also
32:00 something you do
32:02 to realize what is the perfect job for
32:05 you right so you you know okay this is
32:07 the area where I want to focus and in
32:10 order to do that you you mentioned this
32:13 information interviews informational
32:15 interviews informational interviews
32:18 exactly so how does it look like okay I
32:21 have this top five companies where I
32:22 want to work I open LinkedIn I say data
32:27 scientist at company X remerge
32:30 whatever right and then I see okay these
32:32 are the people who work there so what
32:35 happens next do I
32:37 just like how yeah they don't know me I
32:41 don't know them like what exactly is
32:43 uncomfortable especially for doing it
32:46 the first time uh uncomfortable to do
32:49 the information Andie so I can yeah it's
32:53 normal to feel uncomfortable but
32:55 thinking about um the results so the
32:58 outcome so let's before the outcome of
33:00 information interview it gives you an
33:03 idea as I said about what the company is
33:05 doing what the role is doing and you can
33:07 get advice now I have that goal so I'm
33:10 up for it this is um a tool that will
33:14 give me access to this
33:16 information but not only that we have to
33:19 know that people like to help others
33:21 they enjoy giving advice helping others
33:25 it I I don't know Alexi do you like
33:28 helping others yeah like when somebody
33:31 says okay like I have this problem how
33:34 about we meet for
33:36 lunch I would not decline it like why
33:39 would I say no to lunch right yeah or or
33:42 at least if you don't have time for
33:43 lunch you would say okay I do a lunch
33:46 but maybe we can have some time to talk
33:48 I don't know for so people generally
33:51 like to help so to approach for an
33:53 informational interview just be specific
33:56 talk to to the person so I reach out to
33:58 the person hi uh before reaching out to
34:02 them research research that
34:04 person see if they research them on
34:07 LinkedIn I would say of course that's
34:09 the platform that we have do they have
34:13 on Facebook and Instagram right
34:15 yeah professional if you want but I'm
34:19 talking about loline so maybe they do
34:22 share some things of their work of their
34:25 interests of
34:27 um things that they
34:29 support like I I mean um missions that
34:33 they support so or they they blog about
34:38 their texto or something like this so
34:41 research them and find something to
34:43 connect with that person through so
34:47 something about them that you can uh
34:49 tell them for example I liked uh what
34:52 you shared here or we come from the same
34:55 something to connect
34:57 similarities and then from that that say
35:01 that you are currently looking for a job
35:05 and working on the your target companies
35:08 or your target role and you are
35:11 interested you are considering this
35:13 company you are considered to work at
35:15 this
35:17 company so you would like to hear from
35:19 them what advice would they give you and
35:22 how is it like to work at this
35:25 company and invite them for a short
35:27 score like 20 minutes 15 minutes uh make
35:31 it easy to say yes so it's lunch is good
35:35 lunch is good if they say like okay
35:38 let's come for a lunch but don't ask for
35:40 lunch the begin it's like 15 20 minutes
35:43 call or coffee uh and uh that's it so to
35:49 make it easy to say yes mhm and uh well
35:54 I assume I need to be prepared when I go
35:56 to this uh meeting right so what kind of
36:00 questions do I prepare in advance do I
36:03 also send these questions in advance to
36:05 that person like how do you go about
36:06 like an
36:07 actual let's say strategy ah okay the
36:12 strategy is you don't ask the question
36:14 you don't send them the question you
36:15 prepare your question don't send them
36:18 but you prepare a question uh the
36:21 questions could be so depending sometime
36:23 so information interview can be used to
36:26 know about the company or the role so
36:28 there are two things if you want to know
36:31 about the role then Focus your company
36:34 your interview questions on the role so
36:39 questions could be like uh what do you
36:42 do in your daily dayto
36:44 basis um what do you find challenging in
36:47 your job what do you uh like in your job
36:52 and then what what do you dislike what
36:56 do yeah challenging I I call it the
36:58 challenging because not dislike but
37:00 could be dislike but another question
37:03 which is good is what uh would make a
37:07 person successful at a Sim at such role
37:11 for example what would make in your
37:13 opinion what would make a data engineer
37:18 successful these are few questions for
37:20 five questions because it's only 20
37:22 minutes to ask about the role about the
37:25 company be something else but similar
37:28 what do you like about the company what
37:29 do you wish something what do you wish
37:32 uh that was different before you start
37:37 uh one Improvement you want to see in
37:39 the company so not only about what you
37:42 like what you want dislike but also yes
37:47 deeper in in
37:49 questions okay and what can I offer in
37:55 return I have this I had a few lunches
37:59 and then at the end people ask me and
38:03 then I answer questions and then at the
38:05 end I get this question what can I help
38:08 you with what can I offer in return and
38:10 I'm like always my mind goes blank and I
38:12 don't know what to answer to
38:14 that then uh I understand that okay they
38:18 got something from me and they want to
38:20 return the favor right
38:24 yeah if if I'm like asking that person
38:28 so they I ask them questions they
38:30 already spend half an hour of my time
38:31 like how can I figure out how can I be
38:34 useful or I don't need to can ask just
38:38 ask like they ask you how if is there
38:41 anything I can do to help you as well
38:44 sometimes the you find most often they
38:47 will say oh no thank you but yeah but
38:51 just being uh willing to help and
38:54 because when you you have that
38:56 information interview they they get to
38:58 know you a little bit for example I talk
39:00 with someone for informational interview
39:03 and uh to see to ask her about her role
39:07 and she knew that uh I'm a career coach
39:10 so when I asked her okay how can I help
39:13 you she said oh I might need a career
39:16 coach in the future so let's just stay
39:19 in touch so usually this person will
39:21 stay in touch uh will connect with you
39:24 on Linkin later after this interview and
39:27 that on its own later they can ask you
39:31 for help so you don't have to return
39:34 that uh help right away be willing to
39:38 offer it and know that you are now
39:41 gained a new connection a new
39:43 relationship uh that can benefit both
39:46 sides in the future and information
39:49 interview is not to ask about a job it's
39:52 not like to say it's not to ask are you
39:55 currently hiring I'm I want to apply so
39:59 they can suggest it themselves sometimes
40:01 they suggest it and they say oh because
40:04 I know my coach said she she was um
40:07 because she was so prepared for her
40:09 information interview that the person
40:12 She interviewed told her if you want to
40:15 apply then tell me I will refer you so
40:19 you don't ask us ask it explicitly but
40:22 it can happen MH cuz also at this stage
40:26 I guess the purpose is to figure out
40:29 what you want yeah ex maybe you don't
40:31 even know if you actually want to be a
40:34 data engineer at this particular company
40:36 exactly because when you ask them what
40:38 do you what do you not like about your
40:40 job and then you hear back what they say
40:44 you no maybe I'll do to me I did a
40:47 couple of informational interview and
40:50 they beginning oh I like this and then
40:51 the second the third okay no this is not
40:54 for me yeah exactly
40:57 uh so at this stage is just getting
40:59 clear on your on finding the right job
41:03 for you right yeah but I say that don't
41:05 ask for a job because usually now even
41:08 people who are watching and they are
41:09 currently in the job surgery with the
41:11 okay I want to do something to get a job
41:13 not to learn about
41:15 a understand that information but that's
41:17 the second pillar right that's the
41:19 networking we kind of already started
41:22 with networking so we already reached
41:24 out to people we established this Con
41:26 actions but what about this networking
41:29 strategy
41:30 like now I'm looking for a job so now I
41:33 found that date engineering is the right
41:36 job for me right I know the things the
41:40 good things about this I also know the
41:43 challenges or not so good things right
41:45 and now I understand okay I think it's
41:48 for me now I start looking for a job so
41:50 when it comes to networking like how is
41:53 it different from what we
41:55 discussed uh yeah uh how is it different
41:59 is it's not about networking with anyone
42:03 but networking with the right people and
42:06 how do you know the right people you
42:08 have to who are the right people so now
42:11 you are clear on the job so you know the
42:13 job you know I will suppose that you
42:15 know the job you are the companies that
42:17 you want to work at now who are the
42:20 right companies based on that I will
42:23 find who are the people I have to
42:24 connect with but not not only that
42:27 assess your network your current
42:30 Network where are you underinvested
42:33 where are you over invested maybe you
42:35 are connected to many people in another
42:38 field but not that data
42:42 engineering uh fil so see where the
42:46 assessment of where are you over
42:48 invested or underinvested and from there
42:51 create a list of the people that you are
42:52 going to reach out to and have a goal
42:55 for example
42:57 uh every week reach out to five five new
43:01 people and connect to five people that
43:04 you already know so networking is two
43:06 things new people and people already
43:09 that you already know why because
43:12 actually there is um a research that is
43:16 done very old when it was done it was
43:20 done by let's what's the name let me
43:24 see uh a stud by Harvard sociologist
43:28 granov
43:29 VOR uh who studied hundreds of
43:32 professionals and they found that more
43:35 than half learned about their positions
43:37 through personal
43:39 contact and out of those who learned
43:43 about uh the positions from personal
43:46 contact only 16% of them saw that
43:50 contact often and more than 55% so that
43:54 contact only OCC
43:57 occasionally which means this this study
44:00 was like this means that the weak
44:03 connections the weak connections people
44:05 that you don't see that often people
44:07 that that know you but
44:11 occasional are actually your you can tap
44:14 into them to know about the jobs because
44:17 your strongest connection they are
44:19 probably in your same environment on
44:22 same network however those like the weak
44:25 connections can refer you to some new
44:28 opportunities that's why as part of your
44:31 plan is connecting with the the the
44:33 right people new people and as well
44:36 reaching out to those people that you
44:38 already know but haven't been in touch
44:41 for so long and share with them your
44:44 your story uh what you are doing right
44:47 now uh and um yeah just connect with
44:50 them and share with them and if they
44:51 know anything then uh tell them if you
44:55 know any opportunity and so and just
44:57 share with me or have a chat have a
44:59 coffee with them connect with them again
45:01 yeah so that's part of the
45:04 networking I realized that we have a lot
45:06 of questions from the audience the
45:09 audience M yes it's actually 10 that's I
45:12 don't know if we will be able to cover
45:14 all of them but we can start and uh yeah
45:17 so I'll start with the first
45:19 question okay I left my job two years
45:22 ago and I started learning data science
45:23 and python how should I the things I
45:27 learned in the CV and projects I made in
45:30 the CV okay I see that uh I left my job
45:34 two years ago and started
45:38 learning okay you can put them uh in so
45:42 because you left your job two two years
45:44 ago so right now you don't have a
45:46 current experience so so I would put
45:50 first in my resume my skills so after
45:53 like the
45:54 summary I will put my skills and then I
45:57 will put my practical projects my
46:00 practical projects and then
46:02 experience because to make it the first
46:05 thing that they see is the projects that
46:08 you you are doing that's that's how I
46:11 would recommend another thing that I did
46:13 myself because I also left my job when I
46:16 transitioner to data science which is
46:19 instead of moving the section of um
46:21 projects so practical projects I kept
46:24 the professional EXP
46:26 experience but I added so my last job
46:29 ended in this year and from that uh time
46:33 I'm doing uh self-education so I put it
46:36 in the professional experience as well
46:39 uh self-education
46:41 self-employment and I mentioned some of
46:43 the projects that I
46:44 did that's another way also to do
46:49 it and the goal here is uh to make it um
46:54 the first thing that they see that I
46:56 have experience in this field and these
46:58 are my
47:00 projects thank you another question do
47:03 you know any service that can help with
47:06 doing research on companies vacancies
47:09 and requirements I think this is what we
47:10 talked about and you said okay like you
47:13 should come up with top five companies
47:15 that you think you will like and then
47:18 look at the job descriptions there
47:21 understand the requirements
47:24 and if I understand question correctly
47:26 is it asks if I can Outsource that yeah
47:32 okay that's not possible you have to do
47:35 it yourself but I think what they are
47:37 asking is a Ser service maybe a platform
47:40 where you can research a company anyway
47:43 this is something that you have to do
47:45 yourself so researching and where to go
47:48 is you can research on LinkedIn and uh
47:52 you can research uh the companies
47:54 themselves the profile the jobs that
47:56 they have the people that they work
47:58 there so research could be a lot of in
48:02 on Linked In on itself it's not only the
48:04 company profile and then um because in
48:08 the question there is to understand how
48:10 your skills match the required ones when
48:13 you research the
48:15 company you research them to know what
48:18 they are looking for so from there and
48:20 if you like to work at these companies
48:22 this is one thing and then before you
48:26 also did the assessment of your
48:29 skills once you select the the companies
48:32 or yourself you do the matching you see
48:35 like okay this skills like there is some
48:37 skills that I have or I can these are
48:40 some transferable
48:42 skills so this is manual work actually
48:46 and uh but what you can do is you can uh
48:50 do a strength test for example to know
48:52 what are your skills this it's not part
48:55 of the question but in the assessment of
48:57 your profile there are resources to see
49:01 uh your strengths your interests like of
49:04 things uh I can share what are they
49:07 later one uh do you suggest Alexi to
49:11 share them later the resources yeah you
49:13 can just send us links and then we will
49:15 include them in the description yeah
49:18 that is Theo galoop test uh there is the
49:21 high high five test which is a free
49:24 alternative and then also there is the
49:26 interest um one I don't remember the the
49:30 name of the platform but there are some
49:33 Ser platforms to help you with your
49:35 skills figuring out the skills and the
49:37 the strength researching is on
49:40 you yeah cuz like if you Outsource
49:44 then like the process of doing that also
49:47 helps right and if you just Outsource
49:49 and somebody com with results it might
49:50 not be what you actually need yeah it's
49:53 like I was watching for my my business
49:56 talking about the marketing you have to
49:58 do some work yourself to know the the K
50:00 is your message and so on and then you
50:02 can Out Source but there is a part like
50:05 you have to do
50:07 it yeah the next question is from ano do
50:10 you have any advice on how to
50:13 tackle searching for a part-time job
50:16 should I apply for a full-time position
50:18 and say look I only want to work half
50:21 time or like what's the strategy here
50:24 and I assume like if uh somebody let's
50:27 say I imagine a situation where a mom
50:31 wants to go back to work right but she
50:33 still doesn't want to like go full time
50:36 this is the scenario where this
50:37 situation can
50:39 appear uh so it's I think it's a
50:42 personal choice but there are some
50:43 strategies the first strategy which uh I
50:47 found more recommended is to not tell uh
50:51 in the beginning that I want so for
50:53 example you you saw the job that is
50:55 fulltime but you are interested to work
50:58 at this company or maybe because ah
51:01 something after researching the company
51:02 you can even apply spontaneously by the
51:04 way so once you have the list of your
51:06 companies you can apply
51:08 spontaneously and uh so this person
51:11 likes to work at this company but either
51:13 full-time or there is no position what
51:15 you do is you share your interest to
51:18 work at this
51:20 company uh and then you can either tell
51:24 them from the beginning part- time or uh
51:27 go on full time in the beginning and
51:31 then once you prove prove
51:33 yourself uh then switch to part time
51:37 that's the recommendation that I found
51:40 uh with when it's uh of about fulltime
51:44 because usually when you
51:45 say uh part-time and it's fulltime they
51:48 will say oh no we are looking for a
51:50 full-time position and it stops so I
51:53 wouldn't if I if I applied for a full
51:56 time the first
51:57 interview like the first intervie I
51:59 wouldn't say uh uh I like this stob but
52:03 I want to work parttime let it at least
52:06 in the in the advances so not from the
52:09 first
52:10 interview I know also someone I helped
52:13 who from the beginning she want mention
52:15 it part time so it depends for
52:18 you like yeah how much is it a priority
52:22 or discuss
52:24 negotiable uh but it's better to full
52:27 time keep it full time in the beginning
52:29 because I imagine that let's say if we
52:31 talk about Germany in Germany the
52:34 probation period is usually six months
52:36 like half a year it means that probably
52:39 you'll need to work fulltime for at
52:42 least six months right months before you
52:44 can ask
52:46 for reduction in ours yeah I would say
52:48 in this time uh in this um fulltime
52:52 first six months if the company is
52:54 flexible so
52:56 um Target specific companies who have
52:58 the flexibility who can give you the
53:01 remote option and then just focus on
53:04 that and then once you
53:06 have uh you are either progressed in the
53:09 interview so you can tell them okay I
53:12 they are more interested in you because
53:13 they kept okay I want this person it's
53:17 not like you say it in the
53:19 beginning and the flexibility can make
53:22 easy the full-time work so it had to
53:26 experiment
53:29 that yeah thank you so I worked in bi
53:32 for five years and the last year also
53:36 with some tools like alter and Tableau I
53:40 don't know Tableau is like dashboard too
53:42 yeah
53:44 so now I have time to study data
53:47 engineering I am 42 years old am I too
53:50 old for the
53:51 move okay you are not too old for the
53:54 move
53:56 it doesn't matter what H you want it
53:58 doesn't matter nor it's like they don't
54:01 it's true maybe there are some
54:02 discrimination based on age but legally
54:07 and so on it's not uh an issue your age
54:11 so and you don't have to put it in your
54:12 resume by the way you don't put in your
54:15 resume your age because it's a personal
54:18 information uh and from there you you
54:21 focus on showing that uh you practi so
54:26 you said for example
54:27 I uh they practiced with Tableau and
54:31 some other tools and they studied also
54:34 data
54:35 engineering time so focus on that in
54:39 your resume in your LinkedIn profile
54:42 show how you can already deliver value
54:44 for uh for the companies because
54:47 companies what do they care about is
54:49 this person going to uh give me the
54:54 results that I I'm looking forward so
54:56 the return on investment I'm going to
54:59 give you salary what can you give in
55:02 return so focus on them move out from my
55:06 age my experience and so on and how can
55:09 I show them that I can deliver them
55:12 these results once you show them how can
55:14 you deliver the results they don't care
55:17 about your age and you can even use it
55:20 at your beneficial like if you have
55:22 experience previous experience and so on
55:24 uh transferable skills those can be
55:27 beneficial uh those can be an advantage
55:31 mhm and yeah if somebody in company
55:34 thinks that uh like for them age is
55:37 important then maybe then you don't want
55:38 to work at this
55:40 company like it's probably all younger
55:43 people who don't have family and who
55:45 just leave at work and like all they do
55:48 is work right yeah and you don't want to
55:51 work there yeah because yeah exactly you
55:54 don't work to work there
55:57 yeah so
56:00 um there is a person who is taking
56:02 currently our data engineering course
56:05 right and the question is should I start
56:07 applying for roles data engineer roles
56:10 while I'm taking the course or after
56:13 because I always feel I always feel like
56:15 I'm not ready
56:17 yet uh I always feel so should I start
56:20 to apply while I'm doing the data
56:23 engineering course or wait okay what I
56:27 would do advice doing is start to share
56:31 about your learnings start to share
56:34 about your name so whatever you learn in
56:38 the course during the course share about
56:40 it try to practice it small projects
56:42 small things that you can put on your
56:44 GitHub profile and from there uh maybe
56:50 if you start applying you can decide to
56:54 apply after if it's a career
56:56 transition uh and you are in the course
56:59 then and you then I will finish the
57:01 course and during the course I start to
57:05 have my marketing strategy the marketing
57:07 straty the last thing so I start to
57:10 network with the people in data
57:11 engineering I start to share my
57:13 learnings and the challenges and so on
57:16 and then after I finish the course I
57:18 start to um to apply for jobs but I have
57:21 already my network ready my marketing
57:23 strategy ready that's the difference
57:26 compared to someone who haven't worked
57:28 on the job search at all before uh
57:31 finishing the
57:32 course and by the way I did it myself
57:35 and uh it landed because I was doing
57:38 that when I was in the career transition
57:40 to data science I started a project on
57:44 computer vision and I was learning okay
57:46 I faced this challeng I have my personal
57:48 website I faced these challenges and I
57:51 was even talking about um the visual
57:54 Studios problems and how I changed them
57:57 and so on and that helped me like uh
58:01 first help some other people because I
58:03 like help some other people that article
58:05 that I wrote I couldn't imagine that it
58:07 will be referred many times because many
58:09 people were facing the same problem and
58:13 I helped them solve it the first thing
58:15 and the second thing people started
58:17 because I was sharing what I'm doing and
58:19 learning and the project that I working
58:21 on I got opportunity like let's come
58:24 tell talk about your project that you
58:26 are working on or so this this already
58:31 shows the show result to me when I went
58:34 went through my transition yeah thanks
58:37 for confirming that we are on the right
58:41 way so in our courses we ask we
58:44 encourage people students participants
58:46 to share what they learn in public and
58:49 we even give them a bit of extra
58:52 motivation to like with score the
58:55 homework and for each post they do on
58:57 social networks when they share
58:59 something they get extra points so now
59:03 you have an answer why you should do
59:05 that like
59:09 uh
59:11 yeah because don't puts the goal only I
59:15 have to share it to show other people if
59:18 you if you we put the goal as a okay let
59:21 me help another person let me engage
59:24 with people and learn from them so you
59:26 know so helping people who are not in
59:28 that path yet yet and engage with the
59:31 people who are more experience it just
59:34 make it as an
59:36 experiment experience that you are doing
59:38 to to with others that's it yeah and
59:42 you'll like you'll be surprised how
59:44 helpful it is actually for you and for
59:47 others because when you also try to talk
59:50 about what you learned or your project
59:52 you are making it easier for yourself
59:54 later in an interview in an interview
59:57 you will remember better because that
59:58 helps you
1:00:00 memorize so which means that it's not
1:00:03 just you write a post on LinkedIn hey
1:00:05 hello Docker cool and that's it you
1:00:08 actually write a post about what you
1:00:10 learned put it on like some blogging
1:00:12 platform and then you share the post or
1:00:14 maybe some challenges at the end you say
1:00:16 okay but I fa this challenge what do you
1:00:19 yeah and ask for opinion
1:00:23 or
1:00:25 okay we should be wrapping up and I see
1:00:27 that there's a comment Gallop test is
1:00:30 the best way to know the top five skills
1:00:32 I did it before twice so we talked about
1:00:35 that so you can use these sort of tests
1:00:38 to figure out your strs yeah and I think
1:00:42 we should be wrapping up maybe before we
1:00:45 finish for the day are there any
1:00:49 resources books courses YouTube videos
1:00:53 whatever that you can recommend yeah
1:00:56 want to learn more about this topic yeah
1:00:59 uh thank you Alix I was uh I just put a
1:01:02 link for the one um my next career move
1:01:06 so next uh my next move website where uh
1:01:10 you can uh do the test there in order to
1:01:13 see what are your interests so the
1:01:15 degree of interest and that's good
1:01:17 because it helps uh guide you for
1:01:20 example in terms of what industry you
1:01:22 are going to be interested in more
1:01:24 uh in contributing to and also what
1:01:27 roles so that is a good
1:01:30 resource um and otherwise I would
1:01:33 recommend the feel the fear and do it
1:01:35 anyway book by Susan
1:01:39 Jeffers and also a book that helped me a
1:01:42 lot which is the success principles by
1:01:45 Jack Canfield the success principles
1:01:49 otherwise it would be the podcast uh
1:01:52 awesome at your job that talks
