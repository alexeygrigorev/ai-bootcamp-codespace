0:00 hi everyone
0:01 this is actually let me
0:05 I'll
0:07 open this theme from my
0:09 from iPhone x 15 people are watching so
0:11 this is very unusual time for
0:13 a stream today because Loris is from
0:16 Australia and for me it's 9 00 am so
0:20 pretty early
0:21 I hope my brain is functioning so
0:25 I hope I still remember the intro so let
0:28 me start so hi everyone Welcome to our
0:30 event this event is brought to you by
0:32 datadox club which is a community of
0:33 people who love data we have quickly
0:35 events and this is one of such events if
0:37 you want to find out more about the
0:38 events we have go to the description

0:55 but not least we have an amazing slack
0:56 Community the link is also in the
0:58 description uh check it out sign up and
1:01 hang out with other data enthusiasts
1:04 during today's interview you can ask any
1:06 question you want there is a link in the
1:08 description or in the live chat so click
1:10 on this link and ask your questions
1:14 with that I will stop sharing my screen
1:18 and uh did you make the tweet
1:21 yes I managed to tweet and I posted on
1:24 LinkedIn as well and see if there's
1:25 anyone
1:27 awake in the Europe at this time yeah
1:30 unlikely
1:33 going to work yeah
1:36 Okay so
1:38 are you ready to start
1:40 yeah whenever you want okay so let's
1:42 start so this week we'll talk about
1:44 business skills for data professionals
1:46 and we have a special guest today
1:47 Maurice Loris is the CEO and founder of
1:51 discovering data where he's on the
1:53 mission to build a bridge between
1:55 Business Leaders and data leaders Loris
1:57 hosts the Discover and data podcast a
1:59 show for Business Leaders for data
2:01 professionals who want to turn into who
2:04 want to turn data into outcomes welcome
2:06 glories
2:07 yeah absolutely thank you thank you for
2:09 having me here that's uh it's it's crazy
2:12 to be on the other side you know I
2:13 watched the show uh recently as a
2:16 listener and every time uh you're
2:18 invited there's this weird like
2:19 Inception thing you don't know whether
2:21 what's actually happening so it's super
2:24 Keen to be here
2:25 um so thank you yeah it's always
2:27 interesting experience to be on the
2:29 other side so like not to host but to be
2:32 a guest yeah
2:35 to go into our main topic of yes for
2:40 data professionals let's start with your
2:41 background can you tell us about your
2:43 career Journey so far
2:45 yeah so
2:47 um sure I in a way very typical for data
2:51 people uh I started out with a
2:54 background in engineering and then I got
2:58 passionate about physics and
3:00 I thought for a moment I would become
3:03 one day a researcher a professor in
3:05 quantum physics then I got to understand
3:08 how Academia works and I realized that
3:10 wasn't quite what I wanted
3:12 and uh the first sort of job that I
3:15 landed after my PhD in quantum physics
3:18 was a data science which aligned really
3:22 well with a lot of the work that I've
3:24 done in engineering as well as my
3:25 background is information engineering so
3:27 it's a lot about
3:29 entropy immutable Mutual information
3:32 statistics a lot of statistics and data
3:35 science as we know is founded really on
3:39 statistics
3:40 um and so yeah I managed to convince
3:42 someone that I could have done the job
3:44 and they hired me and that was the first
3:47 data hire in that company a startup in
3:50 marketing
3:51 uh so very uh that's amazing you can't
3:54 imagine yeah somebody without experience
3:56 as the first hiring data science that's
3:58 uh
4:00 exactly it's typical typical 2018 right
4:03 like that was that was the thing at the
4:05 time
4:06 um
4:07 if you didn't have a data scientist you
4:09 were you were behind you know that's
4:10 that was the business perception and so
4:12 the the chief executive said okay we
4:14 need to hire a data scientist and
4:15 started asking around everybody do you
4:17 know a good data scientist and a friend
4:19 of mine said well I know someone that is
4:21 pretty smart and so that I had the
4:23 classic conversation uh sitting at a
4:25 table across the other side as Chief
4:28 Technical and chief executive and they
4:30 were like
4:31 okay so we have a bold strategy and lots
4:34 and lots of complex business questions
4:36 to to answer now you clearly you're
4:39 clearly smart you've done a PhD in
4:41 physics so you work it out this is your
4:43 desk here's your MacBook Pro
4:45 um yeah I'll see you and stand up
4:47 tomorrow that's the entire interview
4:49 process or they actually uh
4:51 that was my day one the interview was
4:54 yeah the interview was was actually very
4:57 interesting and like a
4:58 um yeah we can talk about the interview
5:00 but the day one was was that and day two
5:04 the CTO looked at me from across the
5:07 room during stand up and asked me okay
5:09 so when is the project gonna get done
5:11 and I'm like
5:13 okay
5:15 things are faster here so there was a
5:17 bit of a shock coming from uh from
5:19 Academia
5:21 um but that's where I learned the ropes
5:23 and I ended up doing a lot of data
5:25 management and data engineering
5:27 just to get the data that I needed
5:30 um and uh just to avoid using Excel
5:32 because at the time
5:33 the there was a very uh compelling
5:36 business need they wanted to integrate
5:37 create some models and integrate into
5:39 the app so it was exciting like I I
5:42 couldn't believe it I was like well we
5:44 get to see the whole workflow from The
5:45 Source data all the way to the
5:47 application and the user and get some
5:49 feedback in iterate it took us nine
5:53 months to to deploy the first model into
5:56 production which for me was forever at
5:59 the time and then I learned how hard it
6:01 it was for data scientists to to put
6:03 anything into production at that time so
6:05 I felt um wow maybe I was actually lucky
6:08 maybe maybe it was it was actually an
6:10 achievement to manage to pull to uh to
6:12 deploy a model in real life what was
6:15 actually the the app was doing and what
6:17 was the model
6:18 oh the app was just recommending so it
6:21 will autopilot had a it's a SAS business
6:24 now they rebranded so you wouldn't find
6:27 it on LinkedIn um but what they were
6:29 doing is just marketing automation so
6:31 you you could create Journeys
6:33 um and tag people and sort of make the
6:36 whole
6:37 um
6:38 the whole workflow for uh someone in
6:42 marketing a lot easier more intuitive
6:43 the platform was incredibly flexible
6:45 like we had this drag and drop
6:47 functionality with blocks there were
6:49 actions and trade disks sort of similar
6:51 to convertkit for those that have an
6:53 experience with that software but way
6:55 more powerful yeah you could do
6:57 literally everything and he would
6:59 natively integrate with everything else
7:02 and they had a lot of Engineers I think
7:06 more than 30 of the engineering team was
7:08 focused on integration so the product
7:10 was really really cool
7:12 and my job was to make the dashboard and
7:16 the reporting way more actionable
7:18 because the problem was overwhelmed of
7:20 information overwhelmed he would log in
7:22 and you will find logs real-time
7:25 information on what was happening across
7:27 all your campaigns and across all your
7:29 contexts and leads but it was very hard
7:32 to focus the attention on okay here's
7:34 what you can do right now to uh to
7:37 improve their campaigns so it was
7:39 um analytics it was reporting and
7:42 set up a basic descriptive work and
7:46 there was also some diagnostic uh work
7:49 on top and the idea then was to Leverage
7:51 The the human intellect to cover the
7:55 last part which was
7:57 um predicted prediction and prescription
7:59 so um
8:01 anomaly detection stuff
8:04 um very simple from an algorithmic
8:06 standpoint but very uh in convoluted
8:09 from an architectural standpoint which
8:12 is interesting so your background was
8:13 engineering and physics yet the work the
8:16 job the app that you worked on was in
8:19 marketing
8:20 like two different worlds how did he
8:23 actually convince them to hire you was
8:25 it enough to say like Hey I'm like I
8:28 know physics I'm smart
8:31 they're a tech startup right so very
8:35 technical people and
8:37 um it was very easy to convince them to
8:39 be honest like it was one of the easiest
8:40 interview processes we started talking
8:43 and I described some of the projects
8:45 that I worked on because they in
8:47 Academia in the context of University I
8:49 actually done some really interesting
8:51 work that never saw the light of um you
8:54 know the wider Community it was stuck in
8:56 published a paper ended up on their
8:58 Tripoli and that was it but um
9:02 yeah if you unpack that that was a work
9:04 on machine on reinforcement learning I
9:08 was looking at non-polynomial heart
9:10 problems for those in the audience that
9:12 love mathematics which I think most of
9:14 them and and I use reinforcement
9:17 learning to create basically a game
9:20 um where a bunch of actors would take
9:22 actions and their actions would compete
9:25 and cause
9:27 other actors to feel the effects of
9:29 these actions until the network
9:30 eventually converge to a non-optimal but
9:34 very close to Optimal solution in like
9:35 record time in like 30 or 40 iterations
9:38 compared to
9:39 being an intractable problem if you
9:42 wanted to to approach it exhaustively so
9:45 that was cool and then I just happened
9:48 to meet this person I wanted to build a
9:51 blob a laser lab in quantum physics and
9:55 so I switched from whatever I was doing
9:57 when I saw lasers you know shiny things
10:00 I couldn't resistance
10:02 let's do it
10:04 yeah so previously in Academia your work
10:07 was publishing papers on IEEE and after
10:10 he published the work is done but now
10:12 you join a company which is a completely
10:15 different domain marketing and then to
10:18 deploy something it took nine months
10:20 which is was very unusual for you right
10:23 yeah I was expecting you know I had the
10:25 model the the basics of the model were
10:28 were ready to be tested on a you know
10:31 larger sample than what I had available
10:32 and do some basic a b testing after a
10:36 month uh from from when I started I just
10:39 uh because I had that good friend of
10:41 mine in engineering uh and I said hey I
10:44 need some data so okay you know let's
10:48 let's IO beers on me lunches on me
10:51 um help me out and so you did it did
10:53 help me out and it gave me a data set
10:55 and I built the initial models off of
10:57 that
10:58 um the into the actual integration live
11:00 that was in beautiful exercise of like
11:03 learning how
11:05 devops works and
11:07 how the world of software development
11:09 really works which is very different
11:11 from statistics and and data science as
11:13 We Know
11:15 so yeah that was you know exposure
11:16 end-to-end from the user needs to the
11:20 engineer that needs to deploy a survey
11:21 in AWS to make that thing happen and
11:23 then eventually that engineer was too
11:25 busy so I took over that part and so I
11:28 became very quickly more of a data
11:30 engineer than a data scientist
11:33 um and uh yeah so luckily I knew the
11:36 basics of coding so I managed to you
11:39 know survive but and eventually we
11:41 publish that stuff in in production
11:43 which was great and I moved more and
11:46 then and then I started developing this
11:48 passion around like aligning people on
11:51 Concepts and
11:53 trying to really understand what they're
11:54 trying to achieve and map those
11:57 requirements into Data requirements I
11:59 found that quite extremely
12:01 refreshing and energizing and um
12:06 so I focused on that and that was a lot
12:08 of fun and what do you understand yeah
12:11 what do you actually mean by that
12:12 aligning people on Concepts and like
12:16 this entire thing maybe we can unpack it
12:18 a little bit
12:19 yeah sure it's also one of the our
12:21 points in our outline for the talk today
12:23 data that makes sense context the
12:25 semantics and meaning
12:27 um
12:28 yeah I've I guess I found the first
12:31 hints that this was a problem
12:33 uh when uh we're having a conversation
12:36 during pause the hackathon we did a
12:38 hackathon one day it was it was fun you
12:40 know everybody were free to spend one
12:42 day solving a business problem they were
12:44 in love with
12:45 and I found myself uh
12:47 um contributing to a customer success
12:51 problem
12:52 and yeah so we do that and at the end of
12:56 the day uh we're drinking beers and
13:00 um this friend of mine says something
13:03 that completely shocks me you know like
13:07 I would I couldn't I I remember
13:10 essentially freezing and looking at our
13:14 Starion in the eyes and yeah I couldn't
13:16 believe what I heard I was like is this
13:18 what you mean or is that what you mean
13:20 and I realized that in that moment that
13:22 we had two completely different
13:24 understandings of what we did for eight
13:27 hours together she built a picture in
13:29 her head that was different from mine
13:30 and they were both very valid pictures
13:33 just not the same picture
13:36 uh and I thought oh okay interesting so
13:38 in how many ways we can
13:41 have different views of the world even
13:43 if we use the same words the concepts
13:46 that we associate with those words can
13:48 be different if our backgrounds and our
13:51 um priorities are different and she was
13:53 in customer success I was more in data
13:55 science and data engineering so kind of
13:57 customer success customer success is
14:00 um like it's sort of like customer
14:01 support or what's what is customer
14:03 success
14:04 and no success was more focused on sort
14:07 of the five percent uh customers by
14:10 revenue and try to get them to um to
14:14 grow even more because account
14:16 management right
14:18 yeah but more focused on um adoption and
14:22 proficiency of the product
14:24 um because even the big ones were
14:25 actually not using the product that
14:27 we're just scratching the surface of
14:29 what the functionalities that we had
14:31 available to them
14:32 so that my work there was to analyze the
14:35 um the user be the usage of the product
14:38 so I was scanning the metadata the logs
14:41 that came from the elasticsearch
14:43 background that we had and try to find
14:47 describe usage so but before I could
14:51 even describe you such I had to describe
14:52 what good usage meant and so we ended up
14:55 doing the session on whiteboarding what
14:58 is success for the product what are the
15:00 key metrics is it the number of elements
15:02 they use is it the complexity of the
15:04 graph that they built is it the um
15:07 number of tags or Advanced features is
15:09 it the ability to export that
15:11 information with other and so
15:13 integration and ecosystem building
15:15 because that potentially could have been
15:17 a lead indicator for stickiness and how
15:21 um and you could then you know argue
15:23 that if people use the product and it's
15:25 embedded they use a lot of the
15:26 Integrations they're less likely to
15:29 churn because you know it's part of the
15:31 ecosystem is going to cost them time and
15:33 energy to uh to chelate and so that
15:36 would tie in with the lifetime value of
15:38 the customer and all the business
15:39 metrics that the business was uh was
15:41 following so
15:43 so context of semantics I mean yeah so
15:46 yeah just the you said something that is
15:48 quite interesting and I wanted to ask
15:50 you about that so you you said that it's
15:52 a lead indicator of stickiness so what
15:54 is a little indicator and what is
15:56 thickness
15:58 yeah good point so stickiness uh is
16:01 um is not the stuff you find on Scotch
16:03 tape it's uh more you think in the
16:06 context of Assassins the probability uh
16:10 of churning which means essentially
16:13 canceling the account and picking a
16:16 competitor just like the opposite of
16:18 churning
16:19 right the opposite of churning yeah yeah
16:21 so if you have high stickiness people
16:23 tend to
16:24 um to you keep using the product and so
16:27 that lifetime value increases and Lead
16:30 indicator this is like some actions or
16:33 some numbers a figure that tells you
16:36 that they're about to leave for they're
16:38 about or they are more likely to
16:41 continue using the product right yeah
16:42 that's right so I don't know how many
16:44 people uh I've ever seen in the audience
16:47 say causal graph but if you think about
16:49 causality and a causal graph like
16:52 connection of nodes with arrows and the
16:55 arrows typically go one way only uh it
16:57 could be that way or this way but a
16:59 one-way only and a causal graph sort of
17:01 tells you okay if if this happens then
17:05 this happens and then that happens so
17:07 it's about establishing a direction on
17:09 that Arrow
17:10 [Music]
17:11 um
17:12 a lead indicator is sort of
17:15 an event or some conditions that are
17:19 very likely to lead to a transition to
17:22 the next stage and so in that case was
17:24 churn but it could be anything else
17:27 yeah for example in my relationship with
17:29 my wife I know that my ability to keep a
17:34 strong separation between my
17:36 professional work and my homework he's a
17:38 lead indicator for how well we go along
17:40 together and
17:42 and how strong and healthy our marriage
17:45 is so
17:46 what's that
17:49 I hope that answers yeah it asks yes I
17:53 interrupted you sorry so you were going
17:55 to say something about context semantic
17:57 and meaning I guess
18:00 yeah I think I learned over time that
18:03 this applies a lot more with um
18:07 cross-functional teams and and larger
18:10 organization than dozen startups the
18:12 fundamental mechanics of it are
18:16 just cognitive biases and just a
18:18 cognitive you know structure the way
18:21 that we process information as humans
18:23 which is something that's always
18:24 fascinated me I never had the
18:27 opportunity to dive deeper into the the
18:29 topic but
18:31 um you know we see a lot that the the
18:33 data knowledge
18:35 um uh data information knowledge wisdom
18:37 pyramid which is one way of
18:39 understanding the different levels in in
18:41 data but I recently uh learned
18:44 um to extend that pyramid and I'm in two
18:47 interviews in particular one with um
18:50 um
18:53 on my tongue Jessica Jessica Talisman on
18:57 my podcast uh the podcast title
18:59 a true data mesh so semantics ontologies
19:04 um and then a true data mesh and the
19:06 other one with Ron Idleman Ron has done
19:09 a lot of work on at the intersection of
19:11 machines and humans so he loves the
19:14 machine human interface and it's just a
19:18 multi-disciplinary sort of stuff that
19:20 really gets me out of bed in the morning
19:21 you know studying cognition psychology
19:24 um and how do we make sense of the world
19:27 essentially and it's so messy because
19:29 everybody has a different way of
19:31 processing information and building
19:33 pictures of what reality is
19:36 [Music]
19:36 um
19:37 and so how do you how do you align
19:39 people on the same understanding you
19:40 know and on the same thing so very
19:44 practically an example is the definition
19:46 of customer uh it's the most used in the
19:49 data management space you know you ask
19:51 someone in sales and have one in
19:54 conceptual understanding what a customer
19:56 is you ask marketing they have a
19:58 different one and the problem is that
20:00 this and there's different
20:00 understandings than reflecting the data
20:03 and how people use the data to do what
20:05 they do
20:07 um and so as data scientist and data
20:08 analyst if we want to support the
20:11 business to achieve the the targets they
20:15 set up as part of this strategy we need
20:17 to understand that different people
20:18 might have different understandings of
20:20 what we see as one metric you know
20:23 customer how hard can it possibly be
20:26 um there's there's one example from
20:28 Scott Taylor you know he tells me the
20:30 story of um the hospital with 170
20:33 definitions of what a patient is and
20:35 that's it's like how can you how can you
20:38 possibly have 170 definitions of what a
20:40 patient is how did they even count this
20:43 well at some point at some point as
20:45 things broke and someone suffered you
20:48 know potentially physical suffering not
20:50 just psychological suffering and it must
20:54 have gotten to a stage where they engage
20:55 in external firm to do some Audits and
20:58 they looked into the databases and they
21:00 count
21:01 they counted 170 definitions it doesn't
21:04 surprise me um so how do we how do we
21:06 make how do we use data to actually have
21:08 an impact on the organization when we
21:10 know that our cognition the very system
21:14 we use to make sense of the world is so
21:16 unpredictable and so random and so
21:19 different and
21:21 that's uh that fascinates me I guess
21:24 another good example would be definition
21:25 of churn right so it could be you can
21:28 Define churn or stickiness in so many
21:30 ways and then it really did
21:34 everything you do when you need to
21:36 analyze data on churn depends on this
21:38 definition
21:39 right and if you use a different
21:41 definition than your analytics will be
21:43 your analysis will be different
21:46 yeah and in this one
21:48 um
21:49 I think this could be actually a
21:52 fantastic introduction to the next point
21:54 that we have in our in our outline which
21:56 is about
21:57 or maybe the last one which is this one
21:59 point that I wrote about around uh
22:01 communicating well building better
22:04 models by building relationships and
22:06 earning trust which
22:09 really like
22:11 it connects really really well with uh
22:13 with communication and storytelling
22:16 something that I am and here I'm really
22:18 curious to hear from the audience
22:21 um
22:22 I didn't even conceive at the beginning
22:24 of my career so for me Mark marketing
22:28 was
22:29 son of the enemy you know I came from
22:33 coming from physics right from yeah
22:37 see this is like science and hard facts
22:40 and numbers everything has a standard
22:41 deviation everything has a mean
22:43 everything has a model that can describe
22:45 it and if you don't have a model I can
22:47 sample it and I can estimate the model
22:49 you know this Theory and books written
22:52 many decades ago on that and to me that
22:55 was solid you know verifiable
22:57 reproducible thinking with marketing I
23:00 was so so it has magic and
23:05 I also Associated persuasion as
23:07 something very bad you know you don't
23:08 want to be the one that persuades people
23:10 because it sounds like manipulating them
23:13 it sounds like getting in their heads
23:14 right so you want to stick to the facts
23:17 you want to show them the numbers
23:20 and I change my mind
23:23 um I change my mind big time on that
23:25 topic I think in fact I think like as
23:28 data professionals we don't do that
23:29 nearly enough and
23:32 um if you think about it we're competing
23:33 for the same amount of funding
23:36 and there's there's only so much money
23:38 that the organization has to invest in
23:40 projects right and
23:44 we are competing against each other you
23:46 know the sales folks the marketing folks
23:48 they know how to tell a story they know
23:49 how to be memorable
23:52 um they
23:53 Leverage The the way that our brain
23:57 works the way that we process
23:58 information not necessarily to lead the
24:01 organization in the wrong way just to
24:03 have that edge just to be
24:05 remembered really and in data we just
24:08 blatter a lot about databases and models
24:11 and we forget that we're talking to
24:13 people that don't know what we're
24:15 talking about they really don't
24:18 they really don't know what we're
24:19 talking about with some exceptions I
24:22 mean if you work in a
24:23 you know think about data maturity
24:25 scales zero to five zero being with sold
24:28 paper we barely use a laptop and um 0.5
24:33 being the majority of the organizations
24:36 where they oh well maybe now maybe I'm
24:38 being too harsh maybe I think Doug Laney
24:41 put it around too being like 45 of the
24:44 organizations that they um are used for
24:47 the statistics back when it was a
24:49 gardener where between two and three in
24:52 the data Machinery space and I think two
24:53 is when you you do have digital systems
24:56 but you don't really have a strategy we
24:58 don't you don't really use data you talk
25:00 about data but that is in Excel
25:02 um in a spreadsheet that has no heading
25:05 no metadata and and the title is
25:07 underscore of V1 underscore final final
25:09 that's kind of level two level two so
25:12 it's still pretty bad
25:14 um level three is is when you start
25:16 having a bit of a function you have a
25:18 data team maybe an analyst or two
25:20 um and four is when you start doing more
25:22 predictive and five is the prescriptive
25:24 but it's really embedded within the
25:26 strategy of the organization most of
25:29 most most organizations don't really
25:32 uh do that sort of stuff and they don't
25:35 have that data literacy high enough so
25:38 that the business can understand what
25:39 the heck are we talking about
25:43 how can we make business understand what
25:46 we talk about
25:48 but yeah I learned from marketing to
25:50 actually do that
25:53 yes and this has been the focus of uh
25:56 for me for the last year to be honest
25:58 and and it's gonna keep continuing being
26:01 the focus in the next two or three years
26:03 the I think the key is to unlearn some
26:07 of the concepts and the beliefs that we
26:09 built up over time especially for those
26:10 that have resonated with the story that
26:13 I shared in the way that I felt about
26:14 marketing and learn to see it in a
26:17 different light as a tool like any tool
26:20 we know that if we want to do
26:22 classification we can you know hop on
26:24 Psychic learn and we have a whole
26:26 plethora of systems that allow us to do
26:28 classification
26:29 just in the same way if we want to have
26:32 an impact in the organization we need to
26:34 use those tools and a tool is a tool
26:38 right it's not bad it's not evil it's
26:40 not good by itself it's just a tool it's
26:44 how we use it that gives that tool
26:47 yeah I the adjective is it good is it
26:50 bad are you doing ethically are you
26:52 doing in the wrong way
26:53 um but we can't just say hey because
26:56 there are examples of people that are
26:57 manipulating other people with marketing
26:59 slogans then I want to be a purist and
27:02 I'm going to just you know step back
27:03 walk away don't even get my hands dirty
27:06 I think that's uh
27:07 that was the mindset that I had to
27:09 overcome and learn how to how to be like
27:12 them but
27:14 retaining my intentions my intentions as
27:17 a data professional is to have an impact
27:19 to be honest I hate the idea of working
27:22 on things
27:23 um
27:23 and just um
27:26 zero adoption is is my biggest nightmare
27:30 when I do any data work uh it just
27:32 doesn't feel good for me yeah
27:36 how does somebody coming from this
27:39 um
27:40 physic physics background from this
27:42 mathematical background to work on
27:45 marketing so how do you unlearn these
27:48 things how do you how do you start
27:51 building trust with business people
27:54 yeah it's a fantastic question I think
27:57 it starts with um with active listening
28:00 and but before you you can listen you
28:03 have to
28:04 you have to learn to be comfortable with
28:09 not knowing what the hell people are
28:12 talking about and
28:14 it's incredibly frustrating I have fresh
28:18 memories because I just started a new
28:20 position
28:21 um two months ago
28:23 um I'm what's called now an Industrial
28:25 Engineer but essentially I'm I'm an
28:27 analyst and I'm trying to help the
28:31 business reduce costs increase margins
28:33 and reduce waste
28:36 which is you know what data people do
28:39 um that any any business wants to wants
28:41 to do
28:42 um one of those things if not all of
28:44 them at the same time
28:46 and
28:48 there's so much domain knowledge when
28:50 you join a new company
28:52 um that it's overwhelming I mean I don't
28:55 know especially we live in a moment of
28:57 volatility so I'm sure that a lot of the
28:59 listeners have a fresh memories as well
29:01 or what is it like to to start a new job
29:04 in a new organization
29:06 and it's TOEFL like we do it because we
29:08 have to do it and uh we can't wait to
29:11 sort of go past that first steepest part
29:14 of the learning curve so that now we are
29:16 comfortable we know where we are in the
29:18 organization we know who our
29:20 stakeholders are stakeholder mapping is
29:23 one of the first things you do in any
29:24 new position and sort of that gives us
29:27 reference points we build a a almost a
29:30 map of what we're doing why we're doing
29:32 it what are the people that we need to
29:34 please who are those we need to be
29:36 careful
29:37 um it's basic survival if you think
29:39 about it and as a data professional if
29:43 you want to really have an impact you
29:45 have to get close
29:47 to um to the business be the business
29:50 meaning like anyone in the organization
29:52 that is trying to achieve something
29:54 tangible and they are struggling to do
29:57 it or they have difficulties and they
29:59 need help so first you need to know who
30:02 they are what the problems are
30:04 whether the problems are worth your time
30:08 and so there's a whole prioritization of
30:10 of projects you can work on because
30:12 you're only one right as an individual
30:14 contributor at least if you're leading a
30:16 team is different but the same
30:17 principles apply you still have to
30:18 prioritize
30:21 um and so that that requires business
30:23 literacy that requires
30:25 um mumbo jumbo you know going to
30:28 meetings where people talk about stuff
30:30 that to be honest when already for most
30:33 of most data professionals don't come
30:35 from a business uh school they don't
30:38 have an MBA
30:40 um they've studied technical stuff I
30:43 don't know anyone who actually went to
30:45 MB
30:48 because we don't need it right like to
30:50 get hired you need to know you need to
30:52 demonstrate that you have a prolific
30:54 GitHub account and you are active on
30:57 Kegel you don't need to demonstrate it
30:59 you know
31:00 business but to have an impact after
31:04 you're hired you need to know how a
31:06 business operates I need to know to
31:08 speak that language I I think I wasn't
31:11 completely correct when saying I don't
31:12 know anyone it occurred to me that but
31:15 usually the people who I don't know
31:17 studied MBA studied business they don't
31:20 start as Junior data scientists right
31:23 they start this like I don't know head
31:24 of a product or head of uh data right
31:29 well yeah well I hope not
31:32 I hope not a head of data and data lead
31:36 they're typically really technical
31:37 positions I mean it depends I mean if
31:40 you start with product head of product
31:42 right so this is a
31:44 a good place to or maybe a product
31:46 manager right and then you
31:48 become head of product right and then
31:50 you get into Data because you work with
31:52 analysts So eventually you might yeah
31:55 become head of data right and in many
31:58 organizations actually head of data or
32:00 director of data reports to the product
32:03 function to the CPO or whatever
32:06 which is
32:07 I guess fine so yeah but most of us we
32:11 study engineering right we studies of
32:13 computer science I don't know economics
32:16 not business development
32:19 yeah absolutely so when we see
32:23 um when we see that
32:25 you know at the business talks about
32:28 targets um on specific values that they
32:31 need to increase they talk about
32:32 penetration they talk about
32:35 um
32:36 differentiation and and humanization of
32:40 the product they talk about
32:42 um education that they are actively
32:45 doing to turn customers that the potent
32:48 leads that don't even uh they're not
32:51 even aware that they have a problem and
32:53 walk them through the five stages from
32:56 unaware to Super Fan they talk about uh
33:01 cost of acquisition for marketing they
33:03 talk about conversion rates for a
33:06 campaign
33:08 like every domain within the business
33:11 has a language that is different from
33:14 the other and if you change industry the
33:17 language keeps changing and plus there
33:19 is all the in addition to all of that
33:21 there is the lingo that is actually
33:22 spoken by the people on the job which
33:25 may be feel filled with acronyms and
33:28 inside jokes and the whole cut and so
33:31 you kind of have to become one of them
33:33 if you want to win their trust and just
33:35 make them understand that you are there
33:37 to try and help that you by no means
33:40 have all the answers because these
33:42 people maybe are there have been there
33:43 for like five seven ten in the case of
33:46 the company I mean
33:48 20 25 years like I have four key
33:51 stakeholders and their average
33:54 time that they've been employed in the
33:55 same organization is 20 years right so I
33:58 work in as the data person and I'm like
34:01 I have zero domain knowledge I need to
34:04 learn from you demonstrate that I'm
34:06 generally curious I actually want to
34:09 learn what it's like to be you at work
34:12 what I what keeps you busy what worries
34:15 you what are your aspirations what do
34:18 you want to achieve personally as a team
34:21 and for the business and hopefully those
34:23 three are aligned but in some cases
34:25 they're not but and only when once you
34:28 have those uh that that kind of Welcome
34:30 then you see that people open up and
34:32 they come to you with ideas so you don't
34:34 have to chase for case studies you don't
34:36 have to do the research the research is
34:38 done by con by establishing those
34:41 relationships first those are the
34:43 foundations of of I think success for
34:45 data professionals I don't see a lot of
34:47 that how how do you actually do this so
34:50 you join a new company right and then
34:53 you set the first thing you do or one of
34:55 the first things is you do this
34:57 stakeholder mapping right for each
35:00 stakeholder you try to understand what
35:03 they do why they do this and you also
35:06 want to prioritize prioritize right
35:09 understand who is more more important
35:11 who you like you said who you need to
35:13 please and who you need to stay away
35:15 from right so how do you do this how
35:18 does it work
35:19 okay so from from a so you have to know
35:23 one thing about me and that's
35:25 I have a terrible memory uh so
35:29 for a long time one of my biggest
35:32 challenges I had when it comes to like
35:35 knowing people and and REM it's
35:38 remembering their names I'm incredibly
35:40 bad with with names like to a point that
35:43 is almost ridiculous right and so uh how
35:46 can you build relationships yes it's
35:48 like sometimes I avoid people because
35:50 they recognize me they call they call me
35:53 by name and I for the love of God I
35:55 don't remember how their name and it
35:57 feels so bad so I kind of try to avoid
35:59 it
36:00 I've been stuck in that for years trust
36:03 me and so one day I learned about notion
36:07 and now there's many systems well okay
36:10 but not sure as well first and when I
36:11 learned it was the only one I was like
36:13 oh maybe I can build a system where
36:15 every time I meet someone
36:18 um I can Google them everybody has
36:20 LinkedIn get a copy of their of their
36:23 photo attach it to the system and build
36:26 a database with people I started out
36:28 actually here right but it's your end
36:31 but for colleagues
36:33 for colleagues yes so that sounds very
36:35 creepy I know I know it's CR I know it's
36:38 creepy and it sounds really really bad
36:40 but it helped me enormously so if you
36:43 ask the how like tactically practically
36:46 how do I do how do I solve the biggest
36:48 barrier to building relationships is
36:50 remembering people's name what they do
36:52 what they care about so I don't
36:54 obviously I don't take notes as you know
36:56 meet someone over a coffee you know like
36:58 okay let me take notes about you no you
37:01 we're humans normal relationships but as
37:04 soon as that interaction ends I know
37:06 that I have to do it I have to collect
37:08 that information that knowledge
37:10 and resurface it whenever I need it
37:12 otherwise it's lost
37:15 and that helps a lot because people
37:17 we're humans right we want to feel
37:20 um acknowledged recognized respected and
37:23 want to feel that sense of belonging and
37:25 connection and it's about manipulation
37:27 it's simply just you know normal people
37:29 are born with a solid memory my memory
37:32 is crap so I need a database a second
37:36 brain right
37:39 this is your stakeholder mapping or this
37:42 is like stakeholder relationship
37:44 management system
37:45 uh no this is just awareness of who is
37:48 who and what the names are that's like
37:50 the first step right the first step yeah
37:52 this is just overcoming my my terrible
37:54 memory then step two is is to attend
37:57 business meetings and there's many in
38:00 any organization
38:01 in any organization like from startups
38:04 to Enterprises people talk business
38:06 every day all day many times a day some
38:09 of those meanings are more engaging some
38:13 are boring but you'll never know which
38:15 ones are valuable until you sample them
38:17 so I know it's crazy right I know it's I
38:19 know it's absolutely crazy something you
38:21 would never do you join and this data in
38:24 your title what do you do you just go
38:26 around and get random invitations to
38:28 teams so don't dislike and Google needs
38:31 to sit there just basically
38:34 hello it sounds like there is no meaning
38:37 whatsoever the first 10 meetings you go
38:39 it's just a different language it's like
38:41 when you go and visit a different
38:42 country where they speak a different
38:43 language it's like I don't know what
38:45 you're talking about there's no way I
38:47 can understand the conversation
38:49 and that's where a lot of people quit
38:51 you know they go like ah yeah so I can
38:53 learn is so much better it gives me Good
38:55 Vibes I can build models you know and I
38:57 don't need that this is bad for me right
39:00 and that's where I think we need to go
39:03 against our instincts because the
39:05 instinct tells you play safe stay within
39:08 the comfort zone and
39:10 um and just get attached to those
39:13 pleasant Sensations that arise when you
39:15 do when you know that you're on top of
39:17 your work you know that you know you
39:19 know what you're doing right nobody
39:21 wants to feel like you're lost
39:23 um but if you stick long enough then
39:25 those words start making sense and now
39:28 you start seeing patterns and
39:29 connections
39:31 repeat rinse repeat you do it over and
39:36 over and over and after
39:38 sooner than you think actually within
39:40 less than three months I guarantee you
39:42 that you you start seeing things from a
39:44 completely different perspective and now
39:46 those people
39:47 recognize you you build a habit of
39:49 attending those meetings and maybe you
39:51 didn't ask a single question for a
39:54 couple months now the first question
39:56 comes in to mind you'll ask it maybe
39:59 privately because nobody wants to ask a
40:03 stupid question in front of like 40
40:05 people they may one day be you know your
40:09 key stakeholders at the beginning you
40:10 play safe and then you build some
40:12 confidence and once you know what you
40:15 know
40:15 um you kind of have a feeling for what
40:17 you don't know then you maybe you dare
40:19 and ask one question and challenge what
40:21 someone said
40:23 and you'll be I mean it's just a
40:25 wonderful thing because
40:28 most people actually open to get fresh
40:31 eyes perspectives on problems and you
40:34 have it and that's the thing that we
40:35 don't see the value of someone that
40:38 attends a meeting from a completely
40:40 different domain you know department is
40:42 that you you don't have priors
40:45 your prior is a uniform distribution to
40:47 speak the language of the audience right
40:49 you do you know doing biases you haven't
40:51 done the shaping yet you everything is
40:54 equally important and potentially
40:57 interesting or potentially not just in
40:59 the same way and that is a superpower
41:02 and so if you can sell that people
41:04 recognize it and they open up and they
41:06 talk to you and now you have friends you
41:08 have new connections
41:10 do you have a system for that it's like
41:12 you have this
41:14 um database with people to remember
41:17 their names
41:18 they also have a system for taking notes
41:20 after these business meetings so then
41:22 you remember you can map Concepts you
41:24 can understand uh who
41:27 um
41:28 like who cares about which topic like
41:30 what is important for people
41:32 yeah absolutely and it's something that
41:35 you can do on day one
41:36 um even knowing
41:39 so I I come from so it's been working on
41:42 discovering data for two years now and
41:44 the whole system is built in notion so I
41:46 knew the software really well but I
41:48 found that for the first four weeks I
41:49 couldn't possibly think about it because
41:51 you that's just all pure overwhelm
41:53 there's so much information coming to
41:56 you that I think the only thing you need
41:57 to do is get some
41:58 you know uh just chill do some yoga uh
42:02 long showers sleep because there's a lot
42:05 going on but after week four
42:09 um things you start seeing some patterns
42:11 and you're like okay now I kind of know
42:13 what the business drivers are we want to
42:15 do x one and the Y you know the net
42:17 sales value has to be above that number
42:18 the margins on our products have to be
42:21 above then that figure
42:23 cool so now
42:25 what can I what are the key activities
42:27 that I'm going to focus on to try and
42:30 sustain and support that business
42:31 strategy and your line managers know
42:34 that right because if you have a good
42:36 line manager
42:37 uh even an average one if it's been in
42:39 the business longer than a year they
42:41 surely know what what are the key
42:42 activities that are more likely to
42:44 support that that strategy and so you
42:46 start from those priors you don't have
42:48 to invent anything they will tell you
42:50 okay very too low hanging fruits are one
42:54 and two so we're gonna start from those
42:56 nice and simple
42:58 um and so I built the system literally
43:00 based on those two
43:02 um first Key activities I try to map my
43:05 my actions and map them to the
43:07 activities I have notes notion has
43:09 things like templates um so every time I
43:11 have a meeting
43:12 um I have button that button creates a
43:15 very simple very Bare Bones uh template
43:19 with you know who am I meeting with the
43:21 date is automatically captured the title
43:23 the meaning
43:25 um and and tags that tell you which key
43:27 activity that those notes May one day
43:30 support and each key activity is a page
43:33 you open it and you have all the notes
43:35 that refer to the Key activities just
43:36 you know but you could do it on a on a
43:38 notebook
43:39 um pen and paper as well let's just use
43:41 notion because it's just wondering uh is
43:44 it do you use your private motion
43:46 account for that or like the you use
43:49 notion at work to like it's a company's
43:51 account I'm just wondering the reason
43:53 I'm asking this is because at my work we
43:56 don't use notion right so there is a
43:58 different system it's called confidence
44:00 like some people hate it some people
44:02 love it will love it but this is what I
44:04 use and then wondering if I want to
44:06 implement this
44:08 today just use my notion account or
44:11 maybe I should use whatever company has
44:16 um It's a Wonderful question and I
44:18 started out creating an account specific
44:20 for work and then I realized that notion
44:23 is literally my second brain so my my
44:27 ideas my knowledge the the things that I
44:30 develop are all there so it makes sense
44:32 to continue doing that in saying that it
44:34 could be tricky depending on so I know I
44:37 don't want to offer legal advice but do
44:39 read your contract and the intellectual
44:42 property closes of that contract because
44:45 you might be in Bridge so the way that I
44:47 resolve this by creating different
44:49 access roles and just segregating I have
44:52 I have databases that are within that
44:54 the same workspace but that's specific
44:56 for
44:57 so that there is no accidental sharing
45:00 with other collaborators for my business
45:02 and stuff like that
45:04 just something to be careful but um okay
45:07 but yeah
45:13 yeah we talked about like prioritizing
45:15 prioritizing is a big one and
45:19 the the question that's interesting to
45:21 me is once you reach a steady state
45:24 and um
45:26 you start being productive you're part
45:28 of the business you attend meetings
45:30 now you are independent right you can
45:33 decide and propose even a use case or a
45:36 project to the business
45:38 how do you prioritize those use cases
45:42 um and that's where I think you turn
45:43 from
45:45 um you you really make the transition
45:47 from onboarding to
45:50 leading your your function or being on
45:53 top of the work that you do
45:54 um
45:55 yeah QC here from the audience if anyone
45:58 has a go-to framework to prioritize what
46:01 what do you focus on
46:03 um how do you make that call is it
46:05 dollar value impact is a
46:07 impact on people and how they work
46:11 is a
46:14 long-term thinking stuff like data
46:16 management gaining data is it
46:19 transitioning to a data warehouse
46:22 um
46:23 yeah
46:24 um yeah so the way I do it may be not
46:28 the most scientific way but just by
46:30 talking to people and understanding what
46:32 they care about like what are their
46:33 goals what are the goals of their
46:35 department and they say okay this this
46:37 and this is important to me and if I
46:39 talk to multiple people and multiple
46:41 people say that this item is important
46:43 to them then this means that this thing
46:47 this piece of work will make more people
46:50 happy right it will contribute to
46:51 whatever they are doing and this is
46:54 pretty simple right so you don't think
46:57 about like money which you probably
46:59 should attend or I don't know some other
47:01 impact but like how many stakeholders
47:03 this thing can make happy
47:05 yeah I think this is a valid wallet way
47:08 of prioritizing too
47:10 yeah yeah absolutely it's like it makes
47:12 me think of network and social media
47:13 right when you find the Nexus of a graph
47:16 it's a node that is highly connected in
47:19 this case the graph is the nodes are
47:21 data projects
47:23 and the edges are how many people that
47:27 data product essentially can can touch
47:31 and yeah the difference is that
47:34 those products don't exist yet they're
47:36 just in our heads in our imagination
47:39 um so that the job is to really
47:41 understand where the business is going
47:42 find those opportunities and and it's
47:45 like marketing you know when you when I
47:46 title a podcast these days
47:48 I came up with like five or six
47:50 different options for a title and I pick
47:52 one the other five or six are gone
47:55 forever right
47:57 um and that's where agility really comes
48:00 in you know that it's not because you
48:02 know we just learn about a particular
48:04 algorithm and we find an opportunity to
48:05 use it a lot of people do that to be
48:08 honest I've seen that over and over we
48:09 are
48:10 curriculum curriculum driven development
48:13 is a thing people want to get better
48:15 specific things they know that the
48:17 average tenure in the industry is low so
48:20 I met people they were like look I'm I'm
48:23 just being realistic here I'm not going
48:25 to be in the job longer than a year and
48:27 a half and so I'm just taking every
48:29 opportunity I can to work on the stuff
48:31 that I think is hot or is going to be
48:33 hot or the market there's a big market
48:35 for it and then jump ship and negotiate
48:37 a bigger salary that is one way of
48:40 approaching the problem right
48:42 uh I'm I don't think that way and so the
48:46 community that I'm trying to build a
48:47 discovering data my podcast uh is of for
48:51 people like that for people that of
48:53 course I have a mortgage to pay of
48:55 course I want to negotiate a bigger
48:56 salary but what gets me out of bed in
48:58 the morning is to see that I do work and
48:59 that work has an impact on real people
49:01 and I can put a dollar value figure on
49:04 that and
49:06 look I don't know if it's because it's
49:07 nice to feel that someone comes in and
49:09 say hey Laura's good work I don't know
49:11 if maybe I'm addicted to that feeling uh
49:13 maybe I'm addicted to the points for me
49:15 and the learnings that's very human
49:17 right too yeah to get addicted to good
49:20 things when people say good things about
49:22 you it's yeah it's just nice it makes
49:24 you feel that you're consequential you
49:27 know that is you're not just doing stuff
49:28 for the sake of crunching numbers you
49:31 are actually having an impact on someone
49:33 or some teams or maybe a whole domain in
49:36 the organization that makes me feel so
49:38 much better so for people like that yeah
49:41 with
49:43 sorry to cut you off
49:45 I I just noticed that there is a comment
49:48 from Alejandra that I wanted to
49:49 acknowledge and read so he's uh writing
49:53 that I have an MBA and precisely
49:55 um so we talked about people with
49:57 business background right starting in
49:59 data and he restarted
50:03 from an individual contributor position
50:05 again and this shift is not easy I'm
50:07 still figuring out how to profit from
50:08 that generalist business knowledge so
50:11 this is a it's quite interesting and I
50:14 wanted to ask you from
50:16 like I think most of the listener
50:18 listeners are not coming from MBA but
50:21 coming from more like a quantitative
50:23 background how do we get this business
50:26 knowledge how do we start supporting
50:28 business strategy how do we
50:31 um because one of the things we wanted
50:33 to talk about is like how can I sit
50:35 with people who are making important
50:37 decisions strategic decisions and how
50:39 can I speak the same language so we
50:41 already talked about this stakeholder
50:43 mapping uh understanding what they care
50:46 about prioritizing things
50:48 um
50:49 and then speaking the same language with
50:51 them yeah and what's next like how can I
50:54 actually contribute my data knowledge to
50:57 this model how can I support these
50:58 business decisions how can I support
51:00 business strategy so I'm going to give
51:02 you an answer that is kind of intuitive
51:04 um the answer is that part is actually
51:07 the easiest okay but there's bad bad and
51:11 this is a huge but
51:13 it requires
51:15 flexibility in the way we manage
51:21 um our identity you know as data
51:24 professionals we identify ourselves
51:26 with the uh the the depth and breadth of
51:30 our technical knowledge
51:32 that is the it's it's great but it's
51:35 also a barrier so
51:37 the biggest transformation for me is to
51:40 learn re rethink who you are right and
51:43 decouple the identity your identity as a
51:46 professional from the tools and the
51:48 Technologies you use
51:50 the reality is that you can you can the
51:54 80 20 rule applies in anything uh the
51:57 Pareto Principle and applies to data
52:00 projects as well so there's 20 percent
52:03 the 20 you can do that gets eighty
52:05 percent of the value
52:07 most of the time for new case studies
52:10 things that are experimental is Excel
52:14 and yet we we see on LinkedIn literally
52:17 literally Wars between people that
52:20 sustained at Excel is bad and people
52:23 that sustain Excel is good and I've been
52:25 a victim of that you know I I took very
52:29 sharp stances on that on that position
52:31 and I said
52:33 from a data management perspective Excel
52:35 is the enemy is the reason why data is
52:37 crap yes there is truth in them but it's
52:39 not that one that's actually true that's
52:42 true right that's true but that doesn't
52:43 mean that we can we need to go sort of
52:46 banning and go like I'm never touch
52:47 Excel again give me a python client or
52:50 I'm out of here because that blocks us
52:53 from having those conversations we can
52:55 do a lot of nice things quickly with
52:58 Excel without you know even starting
53:00 your jupyter notebook you just throw
53:02 like you just open the CC file with
53:04 Excel and then you play with the data
53:05 and then
53:10 it's like to be honest it's even better
53:13 than than Jupiter I mean the the how
53:16 fast it is and how easily you can share
53:18 it because we don't think about that
53:19 right but the other side
53:21 there's not it's not we're not dealing
53:23 with monkeys we're dealing with people
53:25 that have brains they want to understand
53:27 what's happening and they even want to
53:28 feel good about it that collaboration
53:31 that they just established so that it
53:33 was an experiment to see if it's
53:34 worthwhile considering you as an ally as
53:37 a partner to what they're trying to
53:39 achieve that's an experiment when you
53:41 start and you have to prove that it's
53:42 worth it and and what we don't think
53:44 about is we need to also worry about how
53:46 these people feel if I come to you with
53:49 my Jupiter notebook and I showcase all
53:52 my explorative data analysis and that
53:54 package that does all those cool
53:55 graphics yeah maybe there is a wow
53:58 moment but then the next thought
54:01 most of the time is oh geez you know
54:05 he's smart you know that that's a big
54:07 brain and I'm behind and now I don't
54:10 even know how to launch your bloody
54:11 you're gonna know but I don't even know
54:12 what it is and now all that work is
54:16 inside your head as a data professional
54:18 instead of instead of
54:21 initiating a conversation it becomes a
54:23 monologue and that's that's the problem
54:26 it kills the uh the conversation and we
54:29 want those conversations the more
54:30 conversations we have the better we
54:33 understand the domain and the higher
54:35 higher is going to be the impact of the
54:37 models that eventually we'll touch
54:39 python we'll get there we'll do
54:41 predictive and prescriptive but first we
54:42 need to do description and we need to do
54:44 diagnostic we need to be able to answer
54:46 a question why that is the most burning
54:49 question for most businesses people
54:52 don't know why things happen
54:54 and yeah Excel is not the only tool you
54:59 can get definitely the description stage
55:01 and maybe with some you know using your
55:03 brain and your domain knowledge you
55:05 might even be able to do diagnostic
55:06 without
55:07 even touching
55:09 um machine learning but are you gonna be
55:12 okay with that and that's why I started
55:14 I said that it's going to be a clash an
55:16 identity Clash we need to let go of the
55:18 fact that you're cool if you use machine
55:20 learning you're boring if you use Excel
55:22 that is nonsense
55:25 that is completely missing the point the
55:27 point for us is to support the business
55:29 if the business needs excel in that
55:31 moment we need to be okay we need to
55:33 step up like grow up essentially and go
55:37 like okay this is the tool doesn't
55:39 identify me
55:41 I use whatever it takes to serve the
55:43 business
55:44 and are you ready to do that you know
55:47 that's the question not everybody is
55:51 something happened with your video I
55:52 think so you're still oh
55:56 I realized it's so difficult to talk
55:59 about to talk oh now it's good
56:01 so and then on YouTube it was for the
56:03 last five minutes just my face I guess
56:06 oh out
56:08 I have you projected on the screen and
56:11 just
56:13 cool yeah now it works thanks
56:16 um
56:16 yeah we have a few questions and one
56:19 interesting one from Raphael is your
56:22 sound is very good how how to learn to
56:25 speak online
56:27 hey is it only trying and or did you do
56:30 something else for that
56:31 ah it's the sound as in the the quality
56:34 of the audio the the speaking Yeah but I
56:35 think it's both not just like
56:38 my microphone is important right then
56:41 yeah that's not the whole thing right
56:43 so for example
56:46 yeah but like how did you try how did
56:49 you actually learn to speak online was
56:50 it just practice you you thought okay
56:53 let me host the podcast and then you
56:56 just learn to speak online or you did
56:57 something else
56:59 I uh I did something that was atrocious
57:03 it was a
57:05 it was incredibly painful listening to
57:07 yourself after a recording
57:11 no no
57:15 I want to run away yeah and this is so
57:18 weird I need
57:20 and people say yeah you get used to it
57:22 but yeah I'm still I'm still working on
57:27 it on getting used to it but when you
57:29 edit your own podcast you realize
57:32 how much you bladder without really
57:36 yeah you learn to speak
57:39 in a way that it's different like
57:41 varying the tone taking the time to
57:44 pause
57:45 um I
57:46 a lot of us are actually afraid of
57:48 Silence I'm very good at this like I
57:51 noticed that in this uh in this episode
57:53 like the poses were really nice like as
57:56 if you practiced
57:59 right
58:00 no I didn't no well I host the podcast
58:03 so I'd assume after 55 interviews with
58:05 with people
58:07 um you do find patterns and you're like
58:08 in editing I'm like why I should I
58:11 should breathe you know sometimes
58:12 sometimes that's where it comes from
58:15 from realizing how suffocating it is to
58:17 just you know keep talking without
58:18 braining and from The Listener
58:21 perspective when you take that pose
58:24 they can prove to you you allow them to
58:28 breathe yeah and it's it's so much
58:30 easier to follow the podcast I don't
58:31 know if that works but okay we should be
58:35 wrapping up so maybe last question I
58:37 will ask you is do you have any book
58:40 recommendations or resource
58:41 recommendations on the topic of today's
58:43 interview like how what kind of book we
58:46 can read to learn more about business
58:49 skills or what maybe you recommend your
58:51 podcast for that and you don't need any
58:53 book for that
58:55 yeah it's a good question to be honest I
58:57 am have been looking for a book like
58:59 that uh for a while and I'm kind of
59:01 dreaming to write one myself because I
59:04 couldn't find a book on the topic that
59:06 is connected that speaks the language of
59:08 data Professionals in the display of
59:10 books on businesses but you read them
59:12 you're like this is not for me
59:15 um
59:16 um so no I'm sorry I'm not aware of any
59:18 books I do have
59:20 um a podcast that people that are
59:22 interested in the topic of getting more
59:27 um impact out of the work they do they
59:29 can definitely check it out it's called
59:30 discovering data
59:32 discoveringdata.com we just launched
59:35 yesterday at Discord server so unlike
59:39 datatox.club our community has myself
59:42 and my podcast assistance at the moment
59:44 on it
59:45 um the server is open yeah just two just
59:48 two so whoever comes in don't expect a
59:52 Polish system but we've been running now
59:54 for two years and we have so many uh
59:57 sort of people that reached out and said
59:58 you know what it'd be nice to have a
1:00:00 space to hang out and share thoughts
1:00:03 post episodes even before the episodes
1:00:05 and my sort of vision for next year is
1:00:07 to use that space to
1:00:10 to to grow to to fill this Gap that we
1:00:13 all kind of know it's there it's kind of
1:00:15 the metrics right you gotta take that
1:00:16 red pill to to follow the right rabbit
1:00:19 and see what is there because some
1:00:21 people most of us really don't even know
1:00:23 that there is a gap
1:00:24 okay so to join the Discord server what
1:00:28 do I need to do do I need to go to
1:00:29 discovering data website and then scroll
1:00:32 down and then in the future yes at the
1:00:35 moment in the future we are business of
1:00:37 one it's way more simple it's simpler
1:00:41 than that so you you go on whatever you
1:00:43 listen to your podcasts just follow this
1:00:45 car and data the the last episode the
