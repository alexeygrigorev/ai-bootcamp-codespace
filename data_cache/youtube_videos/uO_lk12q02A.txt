0:00 everyone Welcome to our event this event
0:02 is brought to you by datadox club which
0:04 is a community of people who love data
0:07 we have quick events this is one of such
0:09 events today we actually had two events
0:11 but simply because last week we didn't
0:13 have any so yeah this is the second
0:15 event for today

1:02 channel
1:03 and then finally if you have any
1:06 questions during the interview please
1:08 use the pink pinned Link in the live
1:11 chat so click on that link ask your
1:13 question and then I will be covering
1:14 your questions during the interview
1:16 that's all the slides I have and I just
1:19 want to make sure I pronounce your name
1:21 correctly was it Angelica
1:23 Angelica Angelica I apologize Angelica
1:26 yes so yes no problem it's good that I
1:30 asked because now I feel a little bit
1:32 but but now I know how to pronounce your
1:35 name and yeah in Europe it's always
1:37 difficult to know right so yeah you
1:39 never know how to exactly pronounce uh a
1:42 name I always have to ask
1:44 yes
1:46 okay and the intro is over we can start
1:50 right I really
1:52 and this week we'll talk about technical
1:55 writing and data journalism we have a
1:57 special guest today Angelica Angelica is
2:00 a researcher at The Institute of
2:01 informatics and telematics in Italy your
2:04 research interests include data science
2:06 machine learning text analytics
2:08 datability visualization data journalism
2:12 web applications and recently she became
2:14 also interested in data engineering she
2:16 is also a professor at the University of
2:18 Pisa where she teaches data journalism
2:21 welcome Angelica hi nice to meet you is
2:25 for me it's a pleasure to be here with
2:27 you today yeah likewise thanks for
2:30 accepting the invite to be here I also
2:32 want to mention that the question for
2:34 today's interview are prepared by
2:36 Johanna Bayer thanks Johanna for
2:38 preparing the questions and Angelica
2:40 before we go into our main topic of
2:43 writing and data journalism
2:45 I wanted to ask you
2:47 about your background can you tell us
2:50 about your career Journey so far yes
2:53 indeed since I was a teenager my big
2:56 dream was to become a computer scientist
2:59 because I had a computer this was the
3:03 late 90 period And I decided to
3:08 understand how her computer works and so
3:11 my dream continued and at the University
3:14 I studied the computer science
3:17 and then I devoted the old my career to
3:21 the research field and in fact now I'm a
3:24 researcher at the beginning I worked on
3:27 inex in network security with the focus
3:31 on cryptography reputation similar stuff
3:34 I got my PhD on this field but after my
3:40 PhD I realized that web applications
3:44 were more appealing to me than computer
3:47 security so I moved to this field next I
3:53 landed in data science and I worked on
3:56 data science projects for many years
4:00 only recently I'm moving to data
4:03 engineering because I like to explore
4:06 new things and as you can see my career
4:11 is slightly different than that of other
4:14 people because I'm always I always
4:17 remained in the research field I changed
4:21 the only the topic which I studied and
4:26 for me the I can see I'm a privileged
4:28 person because I can decide the topic to
4:33 study and this is a very a very
4:37 interesting aspect of Academia and
4:40 research
4:41 what are you just curious what are you
4:43 researching now in data engineering
4:45 because to me like it looks like an
4:47 engineering topic they're more like
4:50 I don't know practical you know it's
4:53 more like about know-how less about
4:55 research yes uh but yeah I'm
4:58 maybe I'm a bit far from that so I'm
5:00 really curious what kind of research
5:01 stuff is out there yes indeed I'm
5:04 studying the topic and so I don't know
5:07 if I will have an idea how to improve
5:10 something but given my expertise the
5:14 possible idea could be to
5:17 um to add some security aspects to this
5:20 uh to data Maybe how to
5:25 um to recognize if data are
5:30 manipulated or something like this I
5:34 don't know I'm studying the topic and at
5:37 the moment I'm also writing a book about
5:42 this topic and so uh
5:46 we will see okay and that's quite on
5:49 topic to today's conversation right
5:50 writing so you are learning data
5:53 engineering by writing a book about that
5:56 yes that's uh that's quite a good way to
6:00 learn something
6:02 um
6:03 yeah and you already have a few books
6:05 right so you have at least one that I
6:07 know of yes Comet which is Comet for
6:09 data science yes well do you do you have
6:12 you written any other books
6:15 I've written some novice but there was a
6:18 very young some novice short Tales but
6:23 you know think interesting and now I'm
6:27 writing a book about
6:31 Presto the database the very famous
6:34 database used by also by meta yes
6:41 I think they changed the name recently
6:43 right so it's not pressed anymore but uh
6:44 no no no there are select there are two
6:49 the original name was Presto then they
6:53 forked into two two
6:56 different databases which are pressed to
7:00 DB and the tree now there are two
7:02 different projects supported by two
7:05 different foundations ah okay because I
7:09 know it's our company to elix we use
7:12 Presto we used to use Presto and then
7:14 one day
7:15 I connect to presto and it says trino
7:18 and then okay what happened
7:20 yes and then it's our data Engineers the
7:24 updated the version and then this yeah
7:25 they are quite similar but they derive
7:28 from two different uh organizations I
7:32 guess it's like LibreOffice and open
7:34 office right so they have the same
7:37 history but then at some point yeah
7:40 yeah I think so
7:43 one of the topics I wanted to talk to
7:45 you about is data journalism so in order
7:48 to this is one of the things you one of
7:51 your research interests and you're also
7:53 a professor at the University of Pizza
7:56 Hut where you teach this so what is data
8:00 journalism
8:01 yes data journalism is a data-driven
8:05 journalism in sense that similar to any
8:10 data science projects it collects
8:13 analysis filters data to create
8:17 interesting stories data journalism is a
8:21 slightly different from data
8:23 storytelling or data narrative which are
8:26 rather
8:27 Fields
8:29 because data store detailing for example
8:32 is the our top-telling stories from data
8:36 and they could seem the same thing but
8:39 they are not because the objective of
8:42 data journalism is to to
8:46 um to tell news and to use
8:50 store to use data to confirm the story
8:55 they are telling so for example you can
8:58 see long articles
9:02 which talk about something and then they
9:06 use
9:07 data to confirm the the story which is
9:12 narrated
9:14 um in addition with respect to for
9:17 example to uh data science
9:20 which is another aspect in a data
9:24 journalism journalism story you usually
9:27 you don't have the analysis part which
9:32 is the big part in data science usually
9:35 you don't use machine learning or in
9:39 general data analytic analysis models
9:42 you don't train a model in data
9:43 journalism the huge part is to build the
9:48 storyboard and to collect data and then
9:52 while in data science you use Big Data
9:57 yes you in data science usually you use
10:01 a bit data in data journalism will focus
10:04 also on small data sets because the idea
10:08 is to have accurate information
10:11 and then
10:14 um you have to tell the truth and you
10:16 cannot approximate the things
10:19 um for example if you train a model in
10:23 data science
10:25 um or in machine learning this model has
10:28 an accuracy for example of 80 percent
10:31 while in a data journalism you have to
10:34 say a True News you you cannot have an
10:39 accuracy of 80 percent it should be a 50
10:42 percent
10:43 and this is the the main difference
10:46 there are also other differences but to
10:51 give an overview this is the first
10:54 aspect
10:55 can you give an example like I don't
10:58 know like the Articles I'm reading in uh
11:01 I don't know Economist or like these
11:04 journals or newspapers are they doing
11:07 data journalism or is just visual
11:10 journalism
11:11 no I'm not
11:13 um in general I teach my I say my
11:16 students to to build data journalism
11:19 stories but in practice I I don't write
11:24 my data journalism stories
11:27 um I help my students to build their
11:30 stories today to collect their datas
11:33 there are their data sorry there are
11:36 many websites for example one
11:39 interesting website is a The Washington
11:44 Post
11:45 website if you go search on the on the
11:50 web on Google for Washington Post data
11:54 journalism you you find the the group
11:58 their Laboratory
12:00 they write wonderful stories and you can
12:04 learn how to organize a story
12:09 um for example other there are my but
12:13 usually all the almost all the
12:16 newspapers have a dedicated data
12:20 journalism laboratory
12:23 a very specific yes
12:27 I'm sorry
12:28 it's not about fact checking right so
12:31 it's different so it's more like
12:32 supporting your agreements with data yes
12:35 so I'm just trying to think of an
12:37 example can you can you think of
12:38 anything like something you read maybe
12:40 recently like I don't know I know that
12:42 mask bought Twitter like have you seen
12:44 any
12:45 stories about that that are good
12:47 examples of data journalism
12:50 yes
12:51 um for example there was an article by
12:55 The Washington Post which
12:59 um talked about the barriers that the
13:03 wars that were were built in 2015.
13:09 to avoid that migrants
13:13 went from the southwest Asia to the
13:20 Europe
13:22 and they used some data
13:26 to show how the to some graphs also in
13:30 visualizations to show how to how this
13:34 process
13:36 um
13:40 this process happened across the years
13:44 and I don't know if you want then after
13:47 I can send you the link but at the
13:49 moment I don't have it but it's very
13:53 very impressive story other expected
13:58 okay and then a lot of other stories
14:00 analyzed for example the the coffee the
14:06 how
14:08 um the
14:10 oppressors in some lands
14:13 you see the lens to um
14:18 to uh to operate to oppress the local
14:21 people to build a coffee plants and
14:25 similar stuff and they use the
14:28 data to approve their stories
14:32 mm-hmm
14:34 yeah interesting so yeah please do send
14:36 the link it would be quite interesting
14:38 to take a look so what I understood
14:42 um the main difference between the usual
14:43 journalism and data journalism is in the
14:47 usual journalism you have a story but
14:50 it's not necessarily
14:51 based on the data right so you just
14:55 present some facts but you don't show
14:57 diagrams you don't show graphs you don't
14:59 show any things to support the story
15:01 right by while in data journalism you
15:04 have some data source you have some data
15:06 visualization and then you
15:09 raise your story on this data yes I
15:13 think that the the bigger the most
15:16 challenging aspect in data journalism is
15:18 to search for data uh because the data
15:23 are hidden in the on the web and the the
15:29 data journalist must say a must discover
15:34 them
15:35 instead for example in data science so
15:38 you already have data your company
15:41 provides you with your data and so you
15:45 have to analyze them in data journalism
15:47 you have to search for new data also
15:50 small data is not it's not important to
15:52 have big data and the most important
15:55 aspect is to have as many the data
15:59 should be a accurate as much as possible
16:04 otherwise you you
16:09 deliver fake news
16:13 and
16:16 how did you get into Data journalism is
16:18 it something that you started your
16:20 career with or is this something that
16:22 accidentally happened to you because I
16:23 think you mentioned that you actually
16:25 research cryptography right yeah then
16:29 from doing cryptography how did you and
16:32 ended up doing data they are quite
16:35 unrelated right or are they no no they
16:38 are not related when I moved to web
16:41 applications
16:43 my boss
16:45 um asked give me it to uh to start a
16:48 course about
16:50 um
16:50 web applications
16:53 and we started this corset University
16:56 but then he had this smart idea to
17:01 change the course to data journalism I
17:03 don't know why
17:05 not related right
17:08 you just said okay let's let's change
17:10 like to a completely random different
17:13 topic yes because he understood that web
17:19 applications became too
17:22 too old I don't know and they decided to
17:26 involve me in this new uh topic
17:30 I accepted yes I accepted but I was
17:34 surprised by his choice but usually
17:37 he does good choices and I accepted I I
17:43 think that he was right
17:46 look because it I like this course over
17:50 there said the course
17:52 has improved also thanks to the thanks
17:56 to the uh the feedback by by students
18:02 provided by students because here at the
18:05 University of Pisa there is a mechanism
18:07 where every year
18:10 students get a feedback provide the
18:13 feedback about it
18:16 its professor and how the course must be
18:21 improved and over the years we have
18:23 improved this we we still we are still
18:27 improving it but I think now it's quite
18:31 mature
18:33 and who are the students for which kind
18:36 of students this course is is it for
18:37 technical students for students who
18:39 study computer science and want to learn
18:42 more about journalism or it's for those
18:44 like for those who are studying I don't
18:46 know less technical topics and want to
18:48 get into Data this is a party they are
18:51 in a particular area because they are
18:54 humanists
18:57 with a
18:59 background in computer science they are
19:02 they study digital Humanities and they
19:06 have a knowledge both of the humanities
19:09 and the computer science is a it's a new
19:12 course which is not everywhere in the OR
19:16 at least in Italy it's not everywhere
19:20 the name is
19:24 humanistic informatics something uh it's
19:27 pretty interesting that's the to be
19:29 honest this is the first time I hear
19:30 about such eggs
19:32 this profile is very required for um in
19:37 the digital Humanities field for example
19:40 to build to work on archives on cultural
19:44 heritage
19:46 digital Collections and similar stuff
19:50 how technical is this like do you need
19:54 because I think from your description
19:57 you have to be you need to be a good
19:58 writer to write the story like the story
20:03 has have to be there it has to be there
20:05 right but how technical should you be in
20:09 addition to you know being a good writer
20:11 to be a data journalist
20:13 yes you need you could not there are two
20:17 options
20:18 you cannot know anything about
20:22 programming languages and you can use
20:25 tools like Tableau and in this case you
20:29 don't know you you don't use anything
20:31 it's okay or if you have a technical
20:35 background
20:36 usually the most popular programming
20:39 language that you use is the python but
20:42 it's at a high level you don't know to
20:46 uh you don't Focus for example on a
20:50 heavy programming just you need to know
20:53 how to clean some data the how to
20:58 manipulate them it's very easy everyone
21:03 can do this yes
21:06 but the alternative could be double O
21:09 and so you don't need it at all of
21:13 course is the courses in Italian or it's
21:16 in English in Italian
21:19 unfortunately it's in Italian
21:22 um do you know any other
21:24 courses that are in English that are
21:26 open so let's say if I want to go and
21:30 understand learn more about data
21:32 journalism
21:33 do you know any open courses that I can
21:37 check I don't know if it's open but
21:39 there is I think one course on Coursera
21:47 um I can send you the link maybe you can
21:49 share it with the community uh but I
21:53 don't know if it's still available
21:56 um and but it describes
22:00 um
22:01 the aspects from a more from a data a
22:06 journalism point of view it's also the
22:09 books that I have read on data
22:12 journalism
22:14 focus on journalism and then they
22:18 describe a little data
22:22 um maybe a next book could be on data
22:25 but it's a very strict sector very Niche
22:29 sector so maybe there will not be a an
22:35 audience for this book I don't know but
22:38 as I understood the audience
22:40 that you write for in data journalism is
22:44 general public right so let's say you
22:45 write an article for Washington Post so
22:49 then the readers for this article are
22:52 just usual people right so they don't
22:54 have to have a background in a specific
22:56 area
22:57 it depends on the topic of your article
23:01 because if you write an article for
23:05 Washington Post yes probably the general
23:07 user is okay but if you write an article
23:11 for
23:12 um I don't know
23:14 um
23:15 a children
23:18 magazine
23:20 the audience are children and so you
23:24 have to think about your audience before
23:27 writing your article but this is true
23:31 also when you write a book a technical
23:33 book because if you write or an article
23:36 everything you write before writing you
23:39 have to think about the audience I think
23:42 this is the first step
23:45 what does it mean it means that
23:49 you have to focus on the audience need
23:54 do you know who will read your book you
23:57 will read your article
24:00 um which is with what are their
24:03 interests which which skills
24:06 do you they have and then are you
24:11 writing for a technical audience or not
24:14 and this is a very important aspect
24:17 before writing everything
24:20 yeah because the reason I ask this
24:22 question is I know that you do a lot of
24:24 um technical writing so you I don't know
24:27 how many articles you wrote on medium
24:29 like must be hundreds by now right
24:32 um
24:32 1970 maybe yeah you're quite a prolific
24:36 writer and this uh so the articles I
24:39 know that are from you they are
24:42 technical articles so there's technical
24:44 writing which I guess is uh quite
24:47 different from the Articles we've been
24:49 talking so far like data journalism
24:51 right so would you say that data
24:53 journalism is not technical writing yes
24:56 it's not the technical writing it's for
24:58 a general
24:59 audience and also the language you use
25:02 is different but there is a a variety of
25:08 languages that you have to use for
25:10 example if you write a scientific paper
25:12 you need to write in a certain way if we
25:16 write a technical book you have to use
25:19 another language if you write for a data
25:23 journalism you have to write another way
25:25 and so you you should focus on your
25:28 audience this is a the the
25:32 the problem
25:33 so since we have kind of two topics
25:37 right we have data journalism and we
25:38 have technical writing so we talked
25:40 about data journalism what is technical
25:43 writing so what makes writing technical
25:46 if we just add the code does it become
25:48 technical or there is more to that
25:51 I think that's a writing to be technical
25:55 should be should talk about something
25:57 technical uh for example how to set up
26:01 something
26:02 how to perform a task how to do
26:06 something a technical writing is differs
26:10 from for example a research article
26:13 because a research article
26:15 discusses some Concepts and more from a
26:20 theoretical point of view you can still
26:23 have some implementation Parts but they
26:26 demonstrate how you uh your ideas in a
26:31 technical writing instead I think that
26:34 you describe how to solve a problem for
26:38 example if you write a technical book
26:41 this book can be a reference in manual
26:44 where you teach something and also the
26:49 the language you use
26:51 should be sure in a sense in a sense
26:55 that if you
26:57 say something you cannot say
27:01 for example you can do this you have to
27:05 say do this because you have you are
27:10 you are sure of what are you uh saying
27:14 and there are these differences yes so
27:18 let's let's say how to install
27:21 um I don't know how to prepare
27:23 environment for GPU that would be a very
27:26 technical uh article right because you
27:28 have a sequence of steps
27:30 and you have some screenshots you have
27:31 pieces of code and then you just follow
27:33 this yes that's uh
27:36 um I guess this one is easy
27:39 um but uh like let's say
27:42 if we talk about I don't know how to do
27:46 data visualization this is also
27:48 technical right because you walk the
27:50 editor through yes uh like some guide
27:54 right some how to yes
27:56 is it always like that
27:58 like you you just walk The Reader
28:01 through a sequence of things and show
28:03 how to get to the result they need well
28:05 no you can also describe you can report
28:09 some things I think you can provide some
28:13 examples about it about something
28:17 [Music]
28:19 in my book I also this comment for data
28:22 science I also describe some general
28:24 concepts to give to introduce the reader
28:28 to some concepts for example like what
28:31 is machine learning for example right or
28:33 yes for example the general an overview
28:38 but it's different from
28:41 research article where you have to
28:44 explain the details about Concepts
28:49 okay
28:51 and
28:52 and then sorry another thing the most I
28:55 think that the the main difference
28:57 between research articles and also
29:00 technical articles is that in research
29:04 articles you discover some something new
29:08 you describe something new in technical
29:12 articles instead you describe existing
29:16 things
29:18 so maybe you know there are companies
29:21 like stack Overflow that run surveys
29:24 like every year they ask people who are
29:28 members of stack Overflow about their
29:31 interests like about the tools they use
29:32 about the tools they want to use they
29:34 want to learn the tools they hate like
29:36 languages they hate languages they love
29:38 their salary and like it's quite a
29:41 massive questionnaire I don't know if
29:43 you ever took part but maybe you took
29:45 part in similar ones I think O'Reilly is
29:47 doing this there are quite a few
29:49 companies that are doing this and then
29:51 at the end so they collect this data and
29:53 then I don't know one two months later
29:55 they release a report like a PDF so how
29:59 would you classify this report is it
30:00 data journalism is it technical writing
30:03 is it a I don't know
30:07 story data storytelling or what is that
30:10 it depends on how the report is written
30:15 um if you transform your report to a
30:19 story sorry if you start if you only
30:23 report uh data SDR it's a report
30:29 if you extract a story from your data it
30:34 can become become a data storytelling or
30:39 also a data journalism story recently I
30:43 have also read read a book about which
30:48 um about data storytelling which used
30:51 this example of this report of
30:56 obstacle workflow and
30:59 they described how to transform this raw
31:04 data into a story
31:06 this was very interesting this was a
31:10 case of a self-published book
31:14 um because there are the results of the
31:16 option to
31:18 to self-publish a book and it was very
31:22 very
31:23 um interesting uh book maybe I can send
31:26 you the the title and so you can share
31:28 it with the community
31:32 so I am so let's say we have this report
31:35 right so if we just do I don't know
31:38 basic data analysis we aggregate data we
31:42 showed all these pie charts pie charts
31:44 bar charts and all these things and then
31:47 we put them in a PDF
31:49 and we say that okay this is the most
31:51 popular language this is the most hated
31:53 language this is how data scientists
31:55 earn this is just a report yes it is but
31:59 if we let's say write an article about
32:01 different programming languages and we
32:05 say that okay Java and C are the most
32:07 popular programming languages and then
32:10 we add a chart that displays that shows
32:13 that that proves that okay this is based
32:16 on this data set right and then we maybe
32:18 talk about I don't know the story behind
32:20 some of these programming languages then
32:22 it would be more like data and
32:24 journalism right yes
32:27 also in addition to that you to
32:30 transform a report into a data
32:32 journaling story for example you um you
32:36 can add the context to your data
32:40 um for example in the case of of
32:44 programming languages you can group data
32:47 by
32:48 um by the year the how old are people
32:54 re answering to the questions and you'll
32:58 you'll see for example that the the
33:03 I don't know at the ninth the eight 18
33:05 18 Generation
33:11 Um I don't know likes Java and now you
33:15 can start
33:17 searching why this this category of
33:21 people likes like like more Java than
33:25 the other languages maybe they studied
33:28 the job at University and so on and here
33:32 you transform your uh your simple Road
33:36 data into a story to extract to add the
33:39 context and finally the main objective
33:42 when you transform when you want to
33:46 transform your data into a story is to
33:49 add what we say what it's called is
33:54 called wisdom which is to um
33:58 to attach to your data in ethics a
34:03 message a call to action to your
34:06 audience because the final objective of
34:10 a data storytelling or in general the
34:13 data journalism story is to call the
34:16 audience to action and this is not a
34:21 report anymore it's a story and in the
34:24 report in the report do we have call to
34:27 action
34:28 or could be right I could share it with
34:31 your friends
34:32 it's not sufficient okay
34:36 because I guess companies they usually
34:38 do this to get some exposure right so
34:40 the uh the real reason they are doing
34:43 this is uh you know like people start
34:45 sharing it they link to their website so
34:47 that there are more users maybe in this
34:51 case the the promo the take off to
34:54 action in the previous example of java
34:56 people could be
34:58 um
34:59 try to these people who like Java to
35:04 Learn Python invite these people to
35:06 Learn Python because python is more
35:09 recent I don't know okay I see a comment
35:14 in live chat from Adonis so reports to
35:16 your stakeholders can be classified as
35:19 technical writing too
35:21 so Angelica what do you think about this
35:24 is it a character reservation I I don't
35:27 I think that it depends how to the the
35:31 the store the report is built because
35:34 I'm currently studying a data
35:37 storytelling there are many books about
35:40 them one of the most popular is the
35:44 storytelling with that by calling
35:48 and it's very famous book which says
35:52 that when you talk to your stakeholders
35:55 you have to tell them stories and not
35:58 just reports because you have to invite
36:01 them to take some decisions based on the
36:06 data obviously so I strongly encourage
36:10 you to transform your
36:13 said and boring reports to data stories
36:18 thank you
36:19 yeah we have a question so how
36:23 um to make sure that an article that
36:26 you're writing has the right amount of
36:28 data visualization so it's not too much
36:30 not too little just the right amount
36:33 I think that
36:35 um the uh to explain the concept uh to
36:39 explain the concept maybe one graph is
36:44 enough so
36:46 um you can you you have to use one
36:50 graph for it one sorry one concept per
36:55 graph so don't show many Concepts in the
36:58 same graph it it's very confusing and
37:02 then if you have to say many uh many
37:07 Concepts
37:09 um you have to you need many charts but
37:14 um I think that's the
37:16 the audience will get confused because
37:19 the idea is to transmit just a single
37:22 message and all the graphs that you put
37:25 in your report must
37:29 um
37:30 must be in accordance with this message
37:34 so
37:35 um don't feel that your graphs are
37:40 there are two there are few
37:44 um graphs because the the most important
37:48 aspect of your report is not the
37:51 quantity the amount of graphs but the
37:54 message that you want to turn that's it
37:56 I instead I think that in some cases
37:59 it's better a table than a graph because
38:03 it's clearer
38:04 uh if you ever feel just two or three
38:08 data it's not uh it's a useless to use a
38:13 graph usage Yeah by chart no no you can
38:19 buy bar chart like if you only have
38:21 three data points like it's no a chart
38:24 will take simply too much space right I
38:27 fight by charts with all my heart
38:30 because I think that the pie chart if
38:34 there are many
38:36 um many slices in the pie chart you
38:40 don't understand anything if there are
38:43 only two uh two slices in your pie chart
38:48 it gives you the Pacman idea I don't
38:51 know if you know Pac-Man this is the
38:53 character of some video games it seems
38:56 that the degree the great the greater
38:59 part the slice wants to eat this this
39:03 small one and this is a this has a
39:06 negative effect on the audience so don't
39:09 use pie chart
39:11 so you mentioned one interesting thing
39:13 so a purpose
39:16 for an article should be to convey a
39:19 single message and all the
39:21 visualizations you use all the charts
39:23 should support this single message and
39:26 since you wrote so many articles so many
39:28 different articles did you say 170 yes
39:32 so how long are these articles that you
39:35 wrote usually like are they six minutes
39:38 yes five six minutes
39:41 yes there are also a medium or some very
39:45 long articles about 15 minutes to tell
39:49 the truth I don't have the time to write
39:52 this long articles so I keep them short
39:57 um I always I also have started the
40:00 a publication on on medium which is a
40:05 very which is called the syntax error
40:09 but at the moment it's very small where
40:13 the main objective is to solve some
40:17 problems very shortly like a stake
40:20 overflow of in medium
40:23 if you maybe in the in the slack
40:26 Community if someone wants to to write
40:30 to participate to
40:32 this publication they could drop me a
40:36 message and I will be happy to watch
40:38 them to share the link just share the
40:42 link and we will include this in the
40:43 emails in the description yeah that's an
40:46 interesting idea can I can you walk us
40:48 through the process of creating an
40:50 article so you said that your articles
40:52 are usually five six minutes long so
40:54 we're super focused on conveying a
40:57 single message
40:58 and I guess this is what you start
40:59 correct me if I'm mistaken this is what
41:02 you start your article with right
41:04 thinking of what this message could be
41:06 right yes so an overview of the topic
41:09 you start by giving an overview of the
41:11 topic then you uh describe how you
41:15 solved your problem usually I write the
41:18 technical articles which
41:21 um solve some problems some common
41:25 programming problems and so I describe
41:29 an example which
41:32 solves the problem and then I give some
41:35 red structure is very very simple
41:39 you could write sing something
41:43 more complex but in my case it's very
41:46 simple I also provide I usually provide
41:50 the code of the of the the article in
41:55 the separate repository which is well
41:59 appreciated on GitHub small but it's
42:03 appreciated yes so then the format As I
42:07 understood see you first you have a
42:10 problem and then you show the solution
42:12 and at the end we talk about the result
42:14 right and then in this format you kind
42:17 of come up with outline
42:19 [Music]
42:21 so you have this outline in this form
42:23 and then you add text some code yes
42:27 illustrations right how many
42:29 illustrations do you usually add uh I
42:33 generally illustration at the beginning
42:35 to capture the tensor of attention of
42:40 the reader and then maybe technical
42:42 illustrations related to the problem too
42:47 sorry to be solved for example if I need
42:51 to draw a graph I show the graph
42:56 so when do you think about illustrations
42:58 when uh you have an outline but you
43:02 haven't started writing the article or
43:04 at the end you see okay there is just
43:06 too much text I need to add an article
43:08 or how does it work usually for you
43:11 no I when I finish the the topic I
43:16 um I stopped the article if but if the
43:20 article is too short I try to extend it
43:24 for example by sending the example or
43:27 or I think a new
43:31 um our extending the overview
43:34 adding some general concepts and similar
43:38 things
43:39 how do you find topics like you said
43:42 usually you focus on a specific problem
43:44 and then sure
43:46 sorry to show how to solve this specific
43:48 problem
43:49 right how where do you find these
43:51 problems is it something let's say you
43:53 are working on a particular thing and
43:56 then you have this error yes and this is
43:59 is this your main source of inspiration
44:01 or how do you find usually I write on
44:04 the problems that I I personally have
44:08 because I think that maybe they could be
44:11 useful for the community
44:14 um and but some other times I read on
44:19 social networks like LinkedIn or Twitter
44:25 for new libraries for example I try to
44:28 test them and then I write you know it's
44:31 called an article about the topic but
44:34 most of the time I take note of my
44:37 problems and how I solve them this is
44:41 also for me
44:42 a way to keep track of how I solve my
44:47 problems in fact I I'd like to suggest
44:51 the community also to take note of how
44:55 they solve their problems because we are
44:59 used to
45:00 to search on Google but maybe if a
45:04 problem
45:05 comes again twice or three times we need
45:11 to search again Google on the same
45:13 problem instead if you keep track of of
45:16 the problem by writing an article we
45:20 have the solution already available and
45:23 this is my strategy maybe after I don't
45:27 know after 10 months I have the same
45:30 problem I exactly know how to solve it
45:33 mm-hmm
45:35 so these articles that you write they
45:38 are very focused very short to the point
45:41 and then you also wrote a book right and
45:44 the book is not a five minute Series
45:47 right so it's something more
45:48 comprehensive
45:49 so maybe like I have a lot of questions
45:51 about the book but maybe you can tell us
45:53 like how did you end up writing a book
45:55 so you said you were writing uh some
45:58 novels right but then at some point you
46:02 decided to write a technical so how did
46:04 this happen
46:06 um instead the the the the
46:09 situation was this like to different
46:12 because
46:16 uh I didn't choose to to write a book
46:20 because somebody forced you
46:23 no no no no no no uh my in my idea my
46:28 dream was since I was a child to write a
46:31 book okay but
46:34 [Music]
46:34 um
46:35 is about at some point I received the an
46:39 email by an acquisition editor who asked
46:43 me to write a book I was surprised by
46:47 this maybe he watched my I read my
46:52 articles and they contacted me and at
46:56 the beginning well I didn't know if it
47:00 was the best thing to do but then I
47:04 decided to accept and then I wrote this
47:08 book also he proposed me the topic and
47:12 so uh
47:13 instead the topic was proposed by them
47:17 by the publisher I accepted that the
47:21 story is this but it wasn't like coming
47:25 out of the blue right it was something
47:28 just related to some of the Articles you
47:31 wrote you probably you must have written
47:33 an article about Comet for data science
47:35 that's why they thought of you yes I
47:37 wrote an article about Comet and
47:40 overview of comet I also
47:44 um uh is a master contributor of the
47:48 heartbeat
47:49 publication which is the
47:52 um which is the publication by Comet and
47:56 so maybe they contacted me for the for
47:58 these reasons
48:01 okay interesting so basically the recipe
48:03 is you're right
48:05 uh you publish your articles on medium
48:08 some other uh some other platforms and
48:12 then
48:13 people from the publisher like
48:16 Publishers might reach out to you right
48:18 so at least this is how it happened to
48:19 you yeah yes I think that yeah that
48:21 you'll be a great stroke strategy if you
48:23 want to write something to build a
48:25 portfolio of Articles and and then
48:30 which show your capabilities and your
48:34 writing skills there may be someone from
48:37 the acquisition team of of a publisher
48:42 can contact you an alternative could be
48:46 to contact directly a an acquisition
48:50 editor for example I don't know you go
48:55 on LinkedIn you search for the publisher
48:57 and you you search for the acquisition
49:02 editor
49:03 in the company in the publisher and you
49:07 ask them if you if you are interested in
49:11 some books do you approach them with a
49:16 topic so you find I don't know in maybe
49:19 you go to LinkedIn and you write packed
49:21 acquisition editors or mining
49:23 acquisition editors and then you see
49:25 some people and then you send them a
49:26 connection request and you write okay
49:28 I'm interested in writing a book about
49:31 comment or I'm interested in writing a
49:33 book about some specific topic and then
49:36 they might say okay yeah you know what
49:38 let's actually write it right
49:40 yes because I think that if you send
49:43 them if you the alternative is the
49:45 official way is to uh send them to
49:49 fulfill a form and sell the The Proposal
49:52 but in this case I don't know but you
49:55 have a
49:57 less chance to be accepted because you
50:00 are one of the thousands of people who
50:03 send the book proposal if you are
50:05 responsored by in a position editorial
50:08 instead
50:10 um I think that you have a more a great
50:12 greater probability to be a higher
50:15 probability to be accepted
50:17 mm-hmm
50:18 and it's not an easy process I know that
50:21 because I also have written a couple of
50:23 books so I'm curious like how did it
50:26 actually happen what was the process
50:27 from the time from the moment you got
50:29 contacted by an acquisition editor to
50:33 the point when it was actually out in
50:36 print
50:39 it was a long journey it's you know very
50:44 long time it's another job and from this
50:48 first book I learned many things
50:51 and I'd like to share with you this the
50:55 first thing is to read carefully the
51:00 contract before signing it and I think
51:04 that the the first step is to read in
51:08 particular
51:09 the timeline where the delivering
51:13 process is defined the the editor shares
51:17 the publisher shares with you a possible
51:20 timetable where you timeline where um
51:24 where he said he says exactly when you
51:28 have to deliver a chapter and usually
51:31 due to time to market the reasons the
51:35 publisher
51:36 expects a chapter every two weeks
51:41 schedule
51:43 yes I have done this for the book
51:46 comment for data science but I don't do
51:50 this
51:52 never no okay that's just okay but when
51:56 when to sleep right yes and so if you uh
52:01 um if you can if you can ask the the
52:05 publisher to extend this period at least
52:08 four weeks a chapter and if your chapter
52:11 requires more times more time before
52:15 maybe because it's
52:18 um it's it requires many uh codings and
52:23 so on ask them also for six weeks
52:27 also add
52:30 I think that you should also add some
52:33 holidays periods some vacations period
52:36 because the contract has a section where
52:40 you can insert this aspect and then when
52:44 everything is okay for you you can start
52:48 writing assuming that you have already a
52:52 table or contents and so on it's a list
52:55 of chapters if you uh have to write a
52:59 chapter every four weeks
53:02 um in practice you need to write a page
53:05 a day you have a 24 28 days for each
53:11 chapter
53:14 um
53:15 if you remove weekends maybe you have I
53:19 don't know 20 days you can write 20 a
53:23 chapter of 20 Pages only approaching one
53:27 page per day which is very
53:30 easy
53:31 but even before that even before you
53:34 have a contract so for a contract and
53:36 the timeline is you mentioned you need
53:39 to have
53:40 you know to actually feel the timeline
53:42 you need to know what are the uh
53:45 Milestones right what are the chapters
53:46 what are the sections so I guess there
53:48 is also a lot of work before this
53:51 context says like because uh I don't
53:54 know how it happened with you I guess
53:56 usually the this Talent this acquisition
53:59 managers they come
54:01 with I don't know a title they say okay
54:05 I have these titles which of them is
54:07 interesting for you right and then you
54:09 need to actually
54:10 work out work on a proposal right
54:15 or how does it happen firstly you need
54:18 to download the Publishers template you
54:20 have to fill it but the main question
54:24 you have to ask
54:26 uh to you have to tell the truth you
54:29 have to answer this question do I know
54:32 the topic if because if you don't know
54:37 the topic at least in general
54:40 don't write the book
54:43 um valid point but I guess like I was
54:46 kind of under assumption that if you
54:48 want to write a book then you know it
54:50 but it could be that you don't know the
54:54 topic because maybe you work on machine
54:57 learning and you want something about I
55:00 don't know tensorflow but if you don't
55:02 write on things that don't work on
55:04 tensorflow don't write a book on
55:06 tensorflow at least you you must need
55:10 and you must know and overall
55:13 overview of the topic then you I think
55:18 that before writing everything you need
55:21 to
55:22 um to perform to search for other book
55:24 other similar books this is called in
55:28 the same in the research field the state
55:31 of the art you need to
55:33 um
55:34 to see which is or what is already
55:37 available in the market because if your
55:41 book does the add anything about with
55:45 respect to the previous books it's it
55:49 has no there is no sense to write it and
55:52 your books are not market research right
55:55 yes it could be I think I I came across
55:59 this I don't know how Publishers code
56:01 uh so but like your point is that you
56:05 the book should be unique at least in
56:08 one aspect right so it shouldn't be just
56:10 a copy of another book yes when it comes
56:12 to table of content right sorry
56:16 and then once you have the topic
56:21 sorry you have to think about it
56:24 the audience of your book
56:27 and this is
56:29 um
56:30 similar to the previous
56:34 sorry for this cough
56:36 yeah maybe take a moment okay
56:46 okay sorry
56:48 um you have to think about the audience
56:50 and then I think you can start
56:53 writing on a paper everything about this
56:58 topic
56:59 I don't know everything comes in your
57:02 mind is in your brain it's the
57:06 brainstorm phase
57:08 where you decide what to include and
57:12 what not to include in your book
57:15 I think what I did was I created a mind
57:19 map so you know like the in the center
57:21 so I took a page like that like uh just
57:25 a blank page and in the center I put the
57:28 topic okay let's machine learning
57:31 engineering right and then there could
57:33 be branches okay what I can talk about
57:34 this topic I can talk about machine
57:36 learning I can talk about engineering
57:38 and then I kind of Branch out from each
57:40 of these things right and then
57:43 you convert that into a proposal
57:46 eventually
57:47 yes then I think that you can group the
57:50 similar topics that you have found into
57:54 micro areas for example if you have
57:57 found
57:59 I don't know 40 arguments you can group
58:03 in 10 12 macro areas and this will
58:07 become the chapter of
58:09 your book
58:12 um this is a general
58:14 process in instead in to tell the truth
58:18 I didn't follow this step I try I am for
58:24 the book comment for data science I had
58:27 everything clear in my mind I said I
58:30 start saying this then this then this
58:33 and finally this
58:35 okay
58:37 and the editor uh slightly changed
58:42 something but they accepted the proposal
58:47 as it was
58:50 so then you you have this proposal right
58:53 so he works sometime on the proposal and
58:55 then the result The Proposal is
58:57 basically the table of contents right so
59:00 you have the what are the sections what
59:02 are the chapters and then I think
59:05 um you also describe the target audience
59:07 yes
59:08 and also in some Publishers see you also
59:13 have to provide the state of the art
59:15 similar words
59:18 um and the the potential yes the
59:22 audience but you have to you must be
59:25 very very specific for the audience for
59:29 example you you must say if the audience
59:33 is the entry level
59:35 intermediate
59:38 engineering for example if there are
59:42 some requirements for the audience
59:45 because an entry-level book is simpler
59:49 you tell about the basics and so on for
59:54 an intermediate level Studios you have
59:57 to know the topic very well because
1:00:00 you you assume some that the audience
1:00:05 already knows the same things
1:00:08 okay so then there is a proposal which
1:00:11 is hopefully accepted by the publisher
1:00:13 then uh you sign the contract and then
1:00:16 um you should watch out for the things
1:00:17 you described right so yes make sure
1:00:20 it's manageable and you have time to
1:00:23 actually enjoy life and sleep and other
1:00:26 things
1:00:27 and then like if it's one chapter per
1:00:31 month then you need to write around one
1:00:34 two pages per day to finish it right
1:00:37 uh yes but the process is not simpler as
1:00:42 it seems because uh when you submit the
1:00:46 first chapter you you write the second
1:00:50 chapter but after for example two weeks
1:00:53 you get the first chapter back with the
1:00:57 reviews and you have firstly back from
1:01:01 your Editor to to change some editing
1:01:06 aspects and then from reviewers if you
1:01:11 or your research your topic was you if
1:01:16 you
1:01:18 wrote quite well this is a a is this is
1:01:23 easy because the reviewers say say
1:01:26 simply okay
1:01:28 but if you did some mistakes then you
1:01:33 need to write to to work on chapter one
1:01:36 and chapter with Captain chapter 2 and
1:01:40 these this process overlaps with all the
1:01:43 chapters we can see how it can Snowball
1:01:46 right like like when you write chapter
1:01:48 four you still have some uh unfinished
1:01:51 comments from chapter one and chapter
1:01:52 two and then it's like you go math
1:01:55 yes but the idea is to keep you
1:01:58 organized I think that um to if you
1:02:03 leave at least I don't know
1:02:08 per day or one hour per day it could be
1:02:13 sufficient to deliver everything in time
1:02:16 but one hour is is many times
1:02:22 yeah I just noticed that actually we run
1:02:25 out of time so this is a very exciting
1:02:27 topic and then time flies
1:02:30 um
1:02:30 maybe very quick question before we
1:02:32 finish so there's a question from funkan
1:02:35 and the question is can a very routine
1:02:38 200 stroke uh
1:02:41 article on for example Italy's inflation
1:02:44 rate in November 2022 can it be
1:02:48 considered data journalism
1:02:50 or it's more like a report I I didn't
1:02:53 get the point stroke a stroke sorry like
1:02:56 200 stroke I think this is like 200
1:02:59 maybe Pages uh reports from Reuters on
1:03:04 Italy's inflation rate in November 2022.
1:03:08 can it be considered data journalism are
1:03:11 you familiar with Reuters like I think
1:03:13 they are some sort of published in
1:03:17 actually I did I don't so I don't know
1:03:20 the topic I maybe I can investigate this
1:03:24 again uh give a better answer
1:03:28 Maybe
1:03:29 yeah let's
1:03:31 um maybe we can find this article share
1:03:34 it with you and then yes in the notes it
1:03:37 will be published in a couple of weeks
1:03:39 anyways so there is some time okay
1:03:43 um that's um
1:03:45 that was fun talking to you
1:03:48 thanks for joining us today
1:03:51 uh thanks everyone for asking questions
1:03:53 and uh
1:03:55 yeah I think
1:03:57 we can wrap it up and everyone enjoy
1:04:00 your weekend okay
