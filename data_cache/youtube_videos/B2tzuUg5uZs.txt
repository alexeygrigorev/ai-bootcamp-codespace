0:52 So that's the usual intro I do.
0:56 No. Uh,
0:57 yeah. Thank you.
1:00 I think I came up with it like once and
1:02 then ever since I use it.
1:06 Um,
1:09 go.
1:15 We can start if you're ready.
1:17 Yeah, I'm ready.
1:19 Hi everyone. Today we will talk about um
1:25 um the journey of Dashel from going from
1:28 semiconductors doing semiconductors to
1:31 machine learning and um
1:36 yeah Dashel
1:38 sorry I I there are some changes in the
1:41 document like I I don't understand where
1:43 to like I usually just read from it and
1:45 then okay anyways today on the podcast
1:48 on the interview We are joined by Dashel
1:51 Ruiz Barretts who is a data analyst, ML
1:54 engineer, software engineer and ML zoom
1:56 cam gradate. Dashel's career has spanned
1:59 semiconductors manufacturing, software
2:01 engineering, data analytics and teaching
2:03 at microchip technology. He worked with
2:05 complex engineering and production data
2:07 before moving into software and machine
2:09 learning. Today he teaches programming
2:11 and data at major US universities as a
2:14 lead instructor at Thrive DX. So welcome
2:18 to our interview. Welcome to our
2:20 podcast.
2:22 I'm okay. Thank you. Thank you for
2:24 inviting me.
2:26 Yeah, it's pleasure to have you and here
2:29 and for me it's always interesting to
2:31 talk with gradates of um u our courses.
2:36 Um but I'm also interested in learning
2:38 about your career career path. So it's
2:42 um I wouldn't say super unusual but it's
2:44 still not very common. Uh so you started
2:47 uh in the semiconductors industry then
2:50 you worked in software and data. Can you
2:53 tell about uh can you tell us more about
2:55 your career journey so far?
2:58 Uh yeah maybe maybe you're you're right
3:01 it's not completely
3:03 maybe common um because even before the
3:07 semiconductor I was a professional
3:10 musician. Um,
3:13 I came to the US where I'm living uh in
3:16 2012 as a political refugee. And when I
3:20 get here, I was a professional musician.
3:24 I studied nine years classical music,
3:27 classical guitar,
3:28 and I was just playing music all day.
3:31 Where?
3:32 I'm from Cuba.
3:34 Uhhuh. Okay. So, are you in Florida
3:36 right now or where?
3:38 No, I'm in Portland. No.
3:40 Okay. cuz it's a common like I um
3:42 actually you're not the first uh person
3:45 from Kuba with who I speak uh but that
3:48 person listen for it right now.
3:50 Yeah, it's it's completely common. Um I
3:52 I went to Florida like every Cuban but I
3:55 didn't like the city
3:57 that much and
4:00 it's too many Cubans. The problem of
4:02 Florida Cuban and I was sent here. I
4:07 think I we were in I was in this program
4:10 of ref refugees and the US government
4:12 put you in in in different states
4:15 and of the states that I that they
4:20 made me to select I think Oregon was the
4:24 less cold place
4:26 was the reason I choose here and I love
4:28 it here uh really
4:30 it's actually a
4:32 it's really nice it's really nice and
4:34 it's not that as cold as I I think I had
4:37 Pennsylvania and any other on other
4:39 place that was really cold and and we
4:43 don't like cold. Cuba is like summer the
4:46 whole
4:47 the whole year. Yeah. And I got like I
4:49 got here but I couldn't speak the
4:52 language. I didn't speak English and was
4:54 very hard to do anything. Um and I I I
4:59 think after a year I finally found a
5:01 find a a job in in microchip that is
5:04 that have a fab here in in in Oregon in
5:07 production. Actually the position was
5:10 expediter was just walking with a little
5:12 car with wafers on top after you have to
5:16 deliver manually to some places
5:18 to some areas and that helped me to
5:21 understand the flow of wafers through
5:24 the file. That was really
5:28 a job that I have to walk a lot like 25
5:32 26,000
5:34 steps every single day was
5:37 yeah it was a a little work and I was
5:40 moving around to
5:42 a different position until I got to to a
5:46 tech position a pro process engineer
5:49 tech position and there was when I
5:52 finally got all the things we with
5:54 semiconductor because until that until
5:57 that moment I was working in production
5:59 but now at that time I start working
6:03 with engineers running
6:05 tests um running experiments and
6:10 and
6:11 finally
6:14 working with with data
6:16 um and and that was interesting.
6:19 Your your original education was
6:22 engineering right? No, my education was
6:25 music.
6:26 Music? Okay. Like, but how did you like
6:28 first you started as a driver, right?
6:30 Expediter. So, basically, you were
6:33 moving things in a truck. How did you
6:38 manage to actually get an engineering
6:40 position? Did you study in the meantime?
6:43 Yeah, I decided I first I went to
6:45 college to to learn English. That was
6:47 the first step. and
6:51 and I wanted to be in a different
6:52 position for several reason. Finally
6:55 being an engineer and engineer makes
6:58 like more money, more more
7:00 responsibility. But the other thing is
7:03 like I always even with with the music I
7:06 always you I always wanted to know why
7:08 and how and and if you wanted to know
7:12 those you have to move out to production
7:14 and start to to do something to start to
7:16 learning to how how everything is
7:20 happening as a meuctor is like it's like
7:23 magic. It's really the way the chips are
7:26 made are completely insane. Um it's is
7:30 physics is math. Everybody knows that,
7:32 but huge companies are making a lot of
7:35 chips. But but for if you don't have
7:38 that engineer background with a lot of
7:39 physics and mathematics, it's like it's
7:42 like really weird because it's pressure,
7:44 gases, you don't know everything that is
7:46 going on.
7:47 Like even for me,
7:48 it's very interesting.
7:49 I am an engineer technically, but I'm a
7:51 software engineer by education. So if I
7:55 needed to work with semiconductors or
7:58 whatever, I will be completely lost.
8:01 But it's kind of like there it's
8:03 engineering and here it's engineering.
8:05 But for you cuz you your background was
8:08 music. It was like a completely
8:10 different world, right?
8:12 Completely different. And wasn't that
8:15 hard? Maybe by by curiosity. I always
8:17 wanted to to be like my friends were or
8:21 software engineers uh outside of music
8:24 software engineers or architects. that
8:28 my my my friends in Cuba were like uh
8:32 engineers almost all of them like like I
8:34 think half of them architect the other
8:36 half of the software engineers
8:38 and I always were with them. I was the
8:42 musician, but I I knew the homework, the
8:44 C C++, and they were doing this, and
8:47 they were doing that. And I was there,
8:49 maybe they are they were doing a
8:52 homework that was hard, and I was
8:53 waiting for them to finish or or
8:55 whatever to go out and drink a little
8:58 bit and play some music or go to a
8:59 party.
9:00 And I I had that, right? And finally, I
9:03 was able to to do something close to
9:06 that. And even that was the what what
9:09 threw me to data because something
9:12 interesting in microchip and I don't
9:14 know it's the same in another
9:15 semiconductors
9:17 all the process of the chips happen in
9:20 these tools that is huge machines that
9:23 do a lot of processes and you have
9:26 different areas I think I worked in like
9:29 four different areas microchip
9:32 but all the data every time that you
9:35 need to run experiment or to get the
9:37 data to get a result analyze the data
9:41 you have to check the logs files uh for
9:45 the tools they have like thousand of
9:47 lines of
9:49 uh of data coming out and it's very very
9:52 complex because for every second that
9:55 happen in in the process you have the
9:58 amount of gases that are used in that
10:01 process what tool it is what plot some
10:04 tools have like six steps in different
10:06 places and everything that happen is
10:08 locked like every single detail the
10:11 pressure the gases amount like if if a
10:14 gas is going from I don't know from zero
10:17 to 200 pressures like every detail every
10:21 millisecond is is recorded then the lock
10:23 files for one hour is huge
10:27 I have a lot of data and you have to do
10:30 that manually
10:33 like you have to sit there and and and
10:36 and and with the cursor like move to to
10:41 be seen everything's going on and and
10:44 and was like oh it's it's too complex
10:47 because it's not only the data sometime
10:49 you see log file an error a message this
10:52 happened but it's really really really
10:56 complex because it's way more data way
10:59 more data that you think it's not only
11:01 like like every detail every single
11:03 detail that is is going in the process
11:06 is lock or and what should be going or
11:10 happening in that step and that was a
11:13 really
11:15 uh eye opening
11:17 to to data in a semiconductor is way
11:20 more complex and and I'm assuming
11:24 because we have Intel here in Oregon too
11:26 right intel is is close
11:29 um Intel is huge and I'm assuming they
11:32 don't do the steps manually like we used
11:34 to do it Micros was insane.
11:38 Mhm. Mhm. And you learned to parse these
11:42 logs or how did you get into software?
11:44 Yeah. In the beginning, um I I get in
11:49 software. I was I decided to go to maybe
11:51 like you to go from the grad. I was
11:54 doing the the the college. I wanted to
11:58 be a psychologist because I like
12:00 psychology but was too hard and I like
12:04 software at the same time and I decided
12:05 to
12:07 to go for the for the software part
12:09 right the computer computer science
12:12 classes
12:14 but I I'm in this position I'm getting
12:15 this data and you have to do that every
12:19 single day I was working in in this area
12:21 the name is CMP that is uh is chemical
12:26 mechanical plation is when when you grow
12:29 um wafers usually the the chips you grow
12:33 the the oxide or the the material you
12:36 grow you grow that and to make sure that
12:39 everything is is that like the shape you
12:43 have to you have to mechanical
12:46 way like make that planning of that
12:48 wafer and that is a very very sensitive
12:52 step step and you have to check those
12:56 those logs every time that something
12:58 went wrong.
13:00 You have to do that manually. I made the
13:02 calculation to fix the wafer or fix that
13:06 chips, right? Manually I have to I have
13:09 my notebook and I have my calculation in
13:11 my hand. And I had to do that every
13:14 single day because I used to work from
13:16 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m.
13:18 like like
13:21 um I had to do that every single day,
13:23 every single time because we always have
13:25 issues and I have to do that completely
13:27 manually. Check the logs manually and
13:30 and I talk with my supervisor and say,
13:32 "Hey, you know what? I can
13:35 I'm doing this every single day. I can
13:37 write an application that that I don't
13:41 have to make the calculations. I know
13:42 that by memory at that time after like 6
13:45 months I could see how thick was the the
13:50 wafer that time and I manually I was
13:53 okay I this this three more seconds and
13:55 this one needs four more seconds and I
13:57 was right there too many times
14:00 and I was like we need to make sure that
14:02 we have procedure to do this and I can
14:04 write us write a software to do it
14:07 and he was very happy about that and and
14:12 I just wrote wrote everything. I use
14:16 Java FX with Java to make the the UI and
14:20 when everything was done
14:23 um they didn't wanted to use it because
14:26 when everything was working the the
14:29 people from software for the for the IT
14:32 department they didn't wanted to use it
14:34 because was in Java and they wanted to
14:37 use C or something like that.
14:40 Mhm. and was like
14:43 like I I was very frustrated about that.
14:46 Yeah, I can imagine.
14:48 It's like why right and at that time uh
14:52 that was my dad's position in Gil.
14:55 I talked with this other person in in
14:58 Jill and I was talking they were they
15:00 were trying to find a master degree
15:03 person
15:05 um and but we started talking about
15:09 how he was asking me something about the
15:12 job and I I was talking about this thing
15:16 everything was going on and the data I
15:18 was parsing all the time and writing the
15:20 excels or everything I was doing
15:23 manually that I I was telling Hey, we
15:27 could do that automatically. We can
15:28 write something fast in a couple of in
15:31 one week. We didn't have JPT with JPT
15:34 like think in three days or or less than
15:35 that.
15:37 And he was like, you know, I'm trying to
15:39 find someone to help me to analyze the
15:41 data with jail and did this and did
15:43 that. Are you okay moving? He's like,
15:45 I'm okay moving. and I just moved from
15:48 the
15:50 technical engineering position to the
15:52 engineering position without the degree
15:54 at that time. Uh and now is the last
15:58 position I took with microchip was
16:00 working in jail. Now there I was able to
16:04 because I knew the data to start doing
16:06 the analytics and and the engineering
16:08 data part of of that it was very complex
16:12 because like I said it was too many data
16:16 uh about too many details and
16:20 and was very very very complicated. You
16:22 have to go to the tools saying you the
16:25 the engineers don't have access to the
16:28 data outside of the fab. You have to go
16:30 inside the fab put the suit go to the
16:34 tool and do the manually. They have to
16:36 go there. They run a
16:39 something they want to know an
16:41 experiment. You have to do that or at
16:44 that time if you have like a technician
16:46 like me at that time you can rely on
16:48 that person. Hey could you please
16:50 collect this data but you have to make
16:52 sure that the person is collecting the
16:53 data and know what they are doing
16:56 um and this is the way I I finally get
17:00 to yield uh just for a frustration of
17:04 you know I don't want to do this every
17:05 single time because it's the same thing
17:09 and and and I'm just bored to do the
17:12 same thing. It's just I can do I I was
17:14 thinking I can do more stuff like just
17:17 making calculations by hand
17:20 when when when I know what to do with
17:22 that
17:23 and a procedure because in in a fab like
17:26 microchip that make a billion dollars a
17:28 quarter like four five billion a year
17:31 you have to make sure you follow the
17:33 procedure in the way and I was like we
17:37 can do that with a software just simple
17:40 you know you put the thickness of the
17:42 wafer and you get the time for for
17:46 that you need to to process the wafer
17:50 but at the end I think that that never
17:52 happened even when I moved they they
17:53 they never build that software in
17:57 yeah that so the you actually wrote it
18:00 was never implemented by devs right
18:04 no in in that area no I wrote other
18:07 stuff with the data in yield that was
18:10 used But and I was I have a couple of
18:14 happy projects that finally the people
18:16 adopted to use it. But yeah with uh with
18:21 then and I wasn't using data uh uh I I
18:24 was my name was software engineer but
18:27 finally I learned even in in in in when
18:31 I was doing the zoom cam that I really
18:33 was that engineer more than a software
18:36 engineer because I was
18:38 I was that all that data finally have
18:42 access to that data and I was just
18:45 writing scripts in Python to to to clean
18:48 that and I put that in an Oracle
18:50 database and write in a small or
18:55 pl application or other type
18:58 applications that that they have access.
19:01 Yeah. at the end at the end was was was
19:03 that like more automatization
19:08 uh to for for my supervisor just because
19:11 in in yield you try to make sure you
19:14 have the data of the whole fab what is
19:16 going on how many things fails and how
19:19 many thing pass and every request was we
19:24 need we need to get this data how do you
19:26 get we get it and my
19:29 my
19:31 all Those years in different positions
19:32 in market ship gave me access to how
19:36 every area works and how the data was
19:40 behind those data because I was curious
19:42 that we knew what's going on and that
19:45 gave me an advantage with with with
19:48 people in the fab because they were
19:50 engineers or in an area but they didn't
19:52 really didn't know what's going on in
19:54 other area. I've been moving in
19:56 production and and and technician in
19:58 other places gave me the the opportunity
20:01 to see okay this is going on this is
20:03 what you get the data this is the issue
20:05 with this with this this is what the
20:06 engineers want this is the what the data
20:08 is collected and now I they're asking me
20:11 to get something and I know where to go
20:13 who to ask I was able to to talk with
20:16 the production person hey what do you
20:18 think is going on here or or go to the
20:21 engine and say hey how how do I get
20:23 access to the tool tool or the the
20:25 person that fixed the tools
20:28 because some of them work with me too,
20:30 right? And I was able to ask questions
20:32 and get answers and be able to be
20:34 successful with the data part of the of
20:37 the job.
20:38 How did you become interested in machine
20:40 learning in data in general? Like I mean
20:43 yes, you were doing data engineering and
20:45 you said that when you were doing
20:46 experiments
20:48 um you need to analyze a lot of data. Is
20:51 this how it led to think you know maybe
20:55 machine learning can help me or or
20:58 something else?
21:00 Yeah, I think in I think the last last
21:02 year under undergrad
21:05 uh we have to make the the big project
21:07 at the end
21:09 and
21:11 and I think I was trying to find
21:13 something and because I think one of of
21:15 the last classes in was AI.
21:20 um they want us to do to make a software
21:24 to use that could use AI
21:27 and I used um I think the data set of
21:32 the that is everybody uses in the
21:35 beginning to the house prices and and
21:39 and is it really easy in Washington is
21:42 stay
21:43 um in I think in Seattle I think was it
21:47 the first was the Seattle uh
21:50 that I set and it was interesting I
21:52 think was interesting to predict
21:55 something and I and to know what
21:58 something what is going to happen right
22:01 bas something in price and when I was
22:03 getting all this data
22:07 one question that you always ask in
22:10 semiconductor or any any any
22:13 job that's something you repeat
22:16 process that just repeats and repeat all
22:18 the
22:19 is when an error is going to happen.
22:21 That was always a questions with the M
22:23 supervisor is
22:25 you know we know that this happened
22:27 where and how we predict this error that
22:31 way we or we fix the tool be before that
22:34 or or we need do we need to do something
22:38 that way we have a better deal and have
22:41 more sales right
22:44 and that was the you know I can use this
22:48 to be able to do that because until in
22:51 in microchip you have just a schedule of
22:55 of of test sometimes or just what they
22:59 call quals is just to check the tool
23:01 that is ready for production and for
23:04 some sometimes they have a tool have a
23:07 qual every two weeks or every one week
23:09 or every month. It depends of the tool
23:12 how many wafers you run in the tool. But
23:15 sometime
23:17 sometime you feel that you have to make
23:21 the calculations in the amount of wafers
23:23 that were processed on instead of time
23:26 or or or find a way why you need to do
23:29 that and with the amount of data that
23:32 you have. I thought okay maybe it's
23:36 possible to do that and I worked in the
23:40 project that somebody did something like
23:42 that.
23:44 Um that was how many wafers at risk at
23:49 risk was because a tool can have to
23:52 process I don't know how many wafers uh
23:54 every hour depending of the tool
23:57 and because of the quals they wanted to
24:00 know okay every for example a thousand
24:03 wafers that this tool process we need to
24:06 check that is is ready everything is
24:09 okay right the amount of particles
24:10 amount of gases we have to to check that
24:13 and and in the process I was just write
24:17 a software that check all the database
24:20 in in production for the whole fab that
24:23 took me like three months to do that and
24:26 count the amount of wafer process steps
24:28 and to to tell you depending of the area
24:32 how many wafers are risk
24:35 um for different tools.
24:38 But after I have all that that data I
24:42 was thinking I can write something like
24:45 this like we predict how many workers
24:47 will be as risk if we keep working at
24:50 this pace and I don't need to wait
24:53 because I can tell this the the because
24:56 if not knowing in advance that is more
24:58 than two weeks if for example 10 days
25:02 and my prediction is good enough like me
25:04 for me was 85% was good enough Now I can
25:08 tell the engineers, hey, run your quils
25:12 every 10 days, not every 15 days, right?
25:16 Less wafers at risk, less waste
25:20 more money, right?
25:22 and
25:24 and I and I was and that was the
25:26 beginning for the machine learning
25:28 because I I think remember running some
25:30 stuff but I didn't have the knowledge to
25:32 do it I think and I was missing stuff
25:35 because sometime you run in the
25:37 beginning you run some I don't know a
25:40 besian algorithm or maybe in a a random
25:43 tree and you find that you have 65% or
25:48 and you make some tweaks and sudden you
25:50 have 85 you don't know what you or what
25:52 happened and at that point I cannot use
25:55 this algorithm even if I get the result
25:56 that I want because I don't know what
25:58 happened right and I cannot explain to
26:00 my supervisor this is the steps that I
26:02 took this is but I don't know and I was
26:05 like okay I need to go to to learn this
26:08 stuff to to learn analytics and machine
26:10 learning to be able to to do to make
26:13 better predictions and and I fell in
26:16 love of that because I don't know it's
26:18 more interesting for me it was more
26:20 interesting than make softwares that do
26:23 something that do crowd operations
26:26 feel like was the crowd operation was a
26:28 little boring at that time. It's like
26:30 yeah they're asking just to put data
26:32 take out data
26:34 machine learning was more involved
26:36 yeah I was also doing uh maybe a little
26:40 bit more complicated stuff than crowd
26:43 but uh
26:45 yeah like I I remember this uh feeling
26:49 like okay there is data and then you can
26:51 make predictions based on this data this
26:52 is so amazing right
26:54 yeah is and that's what what is very
26:57 interesting Because
26:59 to be able to understand the process of
27:01 the wafers that I was trying to I was
27:05 taking courses to make to understand all
27:07 the process and the atoms and the to
27:10 make how they bound and
27:13 uh was too hard. I needed to take really
27:17 more more math and physics classes that
27:19 I took for for computer science.
27:22 I was like I'm not I don't want to do
27:25 that. Right?
27:26 But I still I was thinking but it's not
27:29 it's not it's not really interesting at
27:31 least not a microchip. Microchip makes
27:32 technology that is is old technology.
27:35 semiconductor for your blender, for your
27:39 refrigerator, for for your car. But the
27:42 new chips, you know, for the computers
27:44 is is Samsung, is Intel, is TMC.
27:49 Um, like you're not going to be in the
27:51 in the front edge of the of the field
27:55 and the data was there, right? And and
27:58 when you do something
28:00 and you get the result
28:02 um you get the heat like I need
28:06 something good. You know when I finish
28:08 that project of the risk and I have the
28:10 the the
28:13 risk only from tool per area that my
28:16 supervisor was happy. But what I decided
28:18 to make one page with the stats basic
28:21 stats range mean uh max standard
28:26 deviation and some prediction right just
28:30 to make some spices in there. He was
28:33 very happy was like yeah this is nice
28:36 because it's not only uh the idea of
28:39 predict okay if
28:41 in two weeks in at this pace in this
28:46 tool we will have 85% with plus minus I
28:51 don't know 100 wafer this amount of risk
28:54 and you you know that you have a problem
28:56 with this tool already and now you're
28:58 watching the tool to make sure that okay
29:01 in in in 3 days before between 6 and 12.
29:06 We need to run something. We need to
29:08 check if if this where we know it should
29:10 be, we will we can run the the calls and
29:14 that's it. If for some reason we stop
29:16 processing because we have an issue, we
29:18 we can wait a little bit, right? But but
29:22 you know what is probably is going to
29:24 happen in the future and you can plan
29:26 for that. And they were very happy with
29:28 for for for that. I was okay this is
29:31 something good. I can I can do more more
29:33 more the d that stuff.
29:36 How do you I think I already asked you
29:39 before we started this conversation. Uh
29:42 do you remember how you came across um
29:45 our course machine learning
29:47 zoom camp?
29:49 As in I said I don't remember well
29:51 because it was the first year of my
29:53 daughter
29:54 and it's blurry but I think um
29:59 I I I don't I maybe I was one of these
30:03 days I was trying to find how to learn
30:07 uh more machine learning and or maybe
30:10 for someone the school because at that
30:12 time I think I was in the
30:15 in grad school already
30:17 because
30:18 As soon as I finish, I wait for a year.
30:21 My daughter was born and I w I just went
30:23 to grad school right away
30:25 or I think a month before she was born.
30:28 Um
30:30 and maybe because I was I went to ASU,
30:33 Arizona State University for computer
30:36 science masters and maybe someone I
30:39 think well someone in the in the class I
30:42 was talking I have this other person.
30:46 Yeah, was him. I I was talking with is
30:49 we were studying for a for a is a logic
30:52 class. I have to double check because
30:54 it's prepositional logic in programming.
30:57 We were using a weird language
31:00 um that Stone University in Europe uses
31:05 and I was talking about machine
31:07 learning. I hit you could you check this
31:10 out and I think I checked one of the
31:13 videos that was public about the
31:15 courses. Another time I was like, "Okay,
31:17 I gonna wait a little bit to to learn
31:20 more about that."
31:22 And
31:24 and I was one day I was like, "Let me
31:26 check this out." Because what happened
31:27 with internet is like 95% of the stuff
31:32 is not good is or is is good for people
31:36 that are in the beginning of their
31:38 career like just to learn how data types
31:41 in Python or how the for loop works. But
31:44 when you go more a little advanced and I
31:48 already have it finished my my grad
31:50 undergrad there's not a lot of good
31:54 stuff like nothing for the middle of
31:56 that time and I was like I was checking
31:59 I went to the GitHub page and I thought
32:02 like you know that's good but I going to
32:05 wait until he begins the in September
32:08 the the course because I don't want to I
32:13 want the paper and I wanted to do it
32:15 with other people too. Mhm.
32:17 The idea is awesome that it's there, but
32:19 I wanted to be more engaged
32:22 uh with the course feels the pressure
32:24 that I have to do the homework, I have
32:26 to do this, I have to send this, I I
32:29 will ask questions and and I wanted to
32:32 have that and I waited
32:34 and I I thought that was a really good
32:37 decision to take the course and to wait
32:40 because I've been I think I told you
32:42 before is so far for me the best course
32:46 ever and I'm being I'm
32:49 I already I from graduate school I I
32:53 have access to to data account like free
32:58 and I have access to Corsera
33:01 and I have access to LinkedIn learning
33:04 is still for the school to be
33:07 uh and the other one is I there's
33:11 another another platform that they have
33:14 this it's the same idea of LinkedIn
33:15 learning that and all of them they have
33:19 really good courses sometimes
33:22 but in comparison with with the quality
33:25 of data talks is is
33:30 sometimes it's not even close I think
33:32 the structure
33:35 is just is just the best for learning
33:38 and it's is not easy
33:41 if you are not following something that
33:44 you just follow the project and get the
33:46 the code in GitHub is done like it's
33:49 done and you guys change the answers and
33:52 and every every time that the the the
33:55 new the new course begins like you can
33:58 even you cannot check the previous one I
34:00 use it it's like
34:01 yeah that's we do this on purpose
34:04 yeah and and that's I will think like oh
34:07 this is a good because I really I will
34:09 think like somebody was used that uh to
34:13 to and and and have the the learning
34:17 public that was really good too because
34:21 that keeps you engaged for me was a
34:22 little like I I want to show people that
34:25 that I'm doing this right and that gives
34:28 you that the the the push to continue
34:32 sometimes because sometimes you get
34:34 tired sometime it's like I don't want to
34:36 do this or something doesn't work I
34:39 don't you don't remember I remember once
34:41 time
34:42 I don't know I don't I don't know If
34:45 yeah was in the second part after
34:48 the
34:49 the midm midterm project
34:52 we moved to use tensorflow.
34:54 Mhm.
34:55 And I was doing this in a Mac
34:58 and we have I have issues to running
35:00 TensorFlow in like
35:03 um one minute and was a pain and at the
35:08 end I I couldn't run it. I just move I
35:10 have a PC. Yeah, I moved to the PC and
35:12 continue finish in the PC and I remember
35:15 talking with you about something is not
35:17 and and you answer the
35:19 the the Slack. It's like oh even he
35:21 answers
35:23 like you know he answers and everything
35:26 and I remember talking about u running
35:29 everything in container and you hey you
35:33 ask me if I can write the the
35:35 documentation that I didn't do it I was
35:38 like h it's too much work um for that
35:41 and somebody when I check there was
35:43 doing something like you don't have to
35:44 even do it um but the the idea of having
35:49 people in Slack that can answer the
35:52 questions that you have. The Q&A is
35:55 awesome. The B is working really well.
35:57 Um, and the the thing for students like
36:01 I really admire you and and seeing that
36:05 the person that is is in the class that
36:08 is teaching you be able with that many
36:10 students to be able to answer to be
36:12 there when is just make a huge
36:16 difference. Nevertheless, I think the
36:18 material the way is taught is is better
36:22 than other platforms because
36:25 it's not um and changes you know
36:30 technology changes and some of the
36:32 models to change with that and at the
36:35 end the practicality of the data talks
36:38 that is the huge different because I
36:42 finished I don't know uh course in
36:45 Corsera we I don't remember huge
36:48 university
36:50 um you can use that you you cannot use
36:53 the course to do something you you have
36:55 some knowledge right but you you can do
36:59 it even
37:01 I took six month boot camp in a
37:04 university in Mexico I did in Spanish
37:07 because I want to learn in Spanish
37:09 and
37:11 one issue that have that university any
37:14 other university in Mexico and the same
37:16 here in the US and he's like yeah you
37:19 know how the algorithm works you know
37:22 the code to roll to to write the the
37:25 forest regressor at the end but you
37:29 cannot use it everything stays in a
37:31 Jupyter notebook and never goes out of
37:34 that right it's just there you run an
37:38 inference you get the your result but
37:40 it's a Jupyter notebook the difference
37:42 with data talk is that
37:46 looks like your goal is to the person
37:48 that pass uses that in real life
37:52 to put that in a one model to put in a
37:55 flask the application I get ready result
37:58 and get your rest API simple
38:01 authentication just basic but that gives
38:05 you an idea okay I can write this and
38:07 you said the work right
38:10 and and that is a huge difference like a
38:13 huge different be able to to use the
38:16 cloud providers to use Google cloud to
38:19 integrate the tools to in the process is
38:23 just make
38:25 make a huge difference with the quality
38:28 of the course that that you can use this
38:30 when you finish
38:31 maybe you cannot get a job because I'm
38:33 seeing the people worried about getting
38:35 the job right away
38:37 but what it's going to give you is the
38:40 ability to really do a really good
38:43 project that you can show a person that
38:46 you can do the job but going to give you
38:47 the tools and you will able to to use it
38:50 like if you are in in a company you can
38:54 write a something good and nice that
38:57 works it's not a notebook and you can
38:59 chor
39:06 it's not a Jupyter notebook like I know
39:08 how to write this inference and that no
39:10 it's it's something real and That's
39:13 that's the difference for my career have
39:14 been a game changer to do the data talk
39:18 courses and I have been I did the ML but
39:21 I did the the L engineer to one too and
39:26 Awesome.
39:27 Okay. So you did the one too, right?
39:29 Yeah.
39:30 That's cool.
39:32 Yeah. you you said uh so many good
39:34 things about uh our courses like um I
39:39 think we just should cut it and use it
39:43 um testimonies and citation cuz
39:47 paste our courses so well. Thank you
39:50 very much for No, but they are they are
39:52 like I can tell you the first the
39:56 midterm in men ML my project was and I
40:00 think I was was we were coming from
40:03 COVID and and I had I I I went to to to
40:08 Mexico for a little bit and I got access
40:12 in the in the school to to the one one
40:16 paper they wrote about how coorbidities
40:20 ities could be bad for for to die from
40:23 COVID. And they have this paper and they
40:25 have the data and I have access to the
40:28 data and
40:32 I was doing the mail pro at that time
40:35 and I decided to you know what more than
40:37 the the Jupyter notebook part I going to
40:40 do the the midterm with this data. Mhm.
40:43 And I finished the project and I put the
40:46 API and I told my other friends, hey,
40:49 you can send the the request and get the
40:51 data. I put it in render and everybody,
40:54 oh, you it's is life, it's working. How'
40:57 you do it? And people with PhDs
41:01 um with masters and it's like even
41:05 masters in computer science like
41:08 you guys can do this. like but I
41:12 remember when I was doing yeah I I have
41:14 all the knowledge I did the masters in
41:16 that analytics
41:18 data mining and inference but we did
41:21 everything in a Jupyter notebook and you
41:23 write the result it's just paper and
41:26 Jupyter notebook but when when you
41:29 finish the the class or the project
41:32 nobody can use that you have a nice
41:35 project nobody no nobody can use it
41:37 nobody can interact with that there's
41:40 nothing. It's just in your computer.
41:42 There's no use
41:45 because if nobody uses your your machine
41:48 learning model
41:50 doesn't matter and it's what data talk
41:53 give you like now it will matter your
41:56 stuff because you can put it there and
41:57 you can put an API say hey guys I make
42:00 this project just
42:03 format the JSON this this way and you
42:05 got the and well you have three months
42:07 to use it because it's for free in in
42:09 Google cloud for three months go ahead
42:12 and the process that goes with that
42:14 because in data talks you teach
42:17 um how to use Google cloud, how to set
42:20 up your VM, how to set up Anaconda and
42:24 containers and
42:25 like you have everything there that that
42:29 the person that know how to write ML
42:33 uh in a Jupyter notebook now finally can
42:37 use it because my god you are not
42:39 getting that in a in a in university
42:43 like you don't and it's is it's not and
42:46 the courses in on YouTube
42:49 no they they don't go that day
42:54 yeah thank thanks a lot um for such kind
42:58 words yeah I think when it comes to
43:00 machine learning I remember my education
43:03 we just study how algorithms work we
43:05 implement algorithms
43:07 we do a lot of mathematics but Yeah, for
43:11 me as an engineer, I want to make things
43:13 available
43:15 and
43:16 yeah, I can people use it, right? Is is
43:20 is the thing the thing that I learn in
43:22 microchip
43:23 without
43:26 I I wasn't looking for that. But I
43:30 remember my supervisor telling me, "Oh
43:33 yeah, it's it's good. You know how to
43:35 predict that? How do I get that data?
43:38 How do I get this result?" Right?
43:41 Because if nobody uses like I I don't
43:44 care if you can f predict something.
43:47 Everybody needs to know and and what's
43:50 going on
43:52 and I was just just just doing that. But
43:55 usually um the idea to know that before
44:00 because I was I was still was in school
44:04 um and my supervisor was kind enough to
44:06 to guide me through the process to help
44:09 me out. I was the only one writing code
44:12 in a team that everybody was something
44:15 different and and was okay. Right. that
44:18 was just they have that that space that
44:22 I could learn in the process and he was
44:25 like okay take the time that you need
44:26 something but we need to do it.
44:29 Um but finally you have a course that
44:34 that I'm still sometime goes right even
44:36 is even I last I was thinking the other
44:40 day I usually don't run terraforms never
44:45 I go to the to the cloud and write or
44:49 and I do it manually because I think
44:50 it's easier and I just run one or two
44:52 instances
44:54 and I was like you know what I need to
44:57 automatize some stuff that I don't want
44:59 to preparing all the time. I will need
45:01 to insert a form.
45:02 Oh, I going to go to data talks again.
45:04 Let me let me let me go to the to the
45:07 class and I think it's is session three
45:09 in that engineering and I go I will take
45:13 that week now I have everything that I
45:15 need and I know that if something comes
45:18 out and it's a new technology you are
45:21 going to have it there
45:22 for sure or you can make some changes or
45:25 you can change this and I can go there
45:27 and and learn that step even I took the
45:30 course the whole thing I graduated uh I
45:33 have my my certific ificate that I will
45:36 show very happy I'm very proud of that
45:40 um but I I feel that I can go to the
45:44 talks to
45:45 to refresh or learn something new and
45:48 and that's awesome
45:49 yeah when it comes to Terraform you said
45:52 sometimes it's easier to just go to the
45:54 web interface click click click
45:57 and get something while it's true these
46:00 days what I found out is sometimes I
46:02 even feel lazy to do that But because we
46:05 have all these AI coding tools, I can
46:08 ask cursor or something else, hey, can
46:10 you create me Terraform file that does
46:12 that and it creates the file and you
46:14 just apply and you get what you need.
46:16 Like it's so much faster
46:19 than opening the interface and then
46:21 going through this
46:23 because like you just all you need to do
46:24 is just type the prompt then hit enter
46:28 and then compile it cursor or whatever
46:30 you use um cloud code like they will
46:34 just create a file some of them will
46:36 even just apply the plan for you like
46:39 it's uh it's amazing.
46:41 No it's awesome. I I use I use PyCharm
46:44 and and and and VS Code usually PyCharm
46:49 more than than than than VS Code. I I
46:52 feel that make my life easier if
46:54 something goes wrong. Uh and and I have
46:58 a I think it's the same. It doesn't
47:00 matter. And you can you have those AI
47:02 tools too there.
47:03 Yeah, I think Brains has a plugin AI
47:07 assistant.
47:09 Uh I even tried it but I usually use VS
47:12 code. So for me it was just okay let me
47:13 try to see what is there in Jet Brains
47:16 but then eventually I went back to V
47:19 code but yeah like pretty cool.
47:23 Yeah I think I have the one I have is is
47:26 Gemini. I'm using more Gemini because
47:29 because I don't have limit in how many
47:31 requests I can make it to to Gemini
47:34 flash and I I find I find that the
47:38 difference is not is not that big
47:40 between
47:42 like now LM have become I think like
47:44 cars
47:45 it's like every every one of them is
47:48 gonna go from point A from point B.
47:50 Yeah. At that point, it's like which one
47:53 do you prefer,
47:55 right? Uh it's not like ch is gonna be
47:59 the one that gonna solve your problems,
48:00 but um it depends what I'm asking. I use
48:04 one so one one another. I think I have
48:06 both uh in my in my pie chart.
48:10 Yeah, I really like uh what you said.
48:13 LMS are just like cars now. I think
48:15 there is a lot of truth in that. Uh do
48:18 you remember what you did for your
48:21 second project in the course ML course?
48:24 Yeah, I yeah I did u is we use for that
48:29 one we use AWS Lambda
48:34 and I made like a a
48:38 butterfly uh classification
48:42 uh thing. Um
48:44 uh was it an image classification model?
48:47 Yeah.
48:47 Okay.
48:48 Yeah. With with Tensor TensorFlow light.
48:53 I think at the end we compare that. It
48:55 was a really good project.
48:57 Yeah. That's pretty cool.
48:58 Where did you get the data from?
49:01 I got the data from
49:04 I think was Kaggle.
49:06 Uhhuh.
49:07 Was a huge amount of data.
49:10 Was a lot of data. Was good. I think was
49:13 like a a terabyte or was a lot of
49:16 pictures. Um
49:19 but you work really well. I think they
49:21 have like in that data set like 50
49:23 different type of
49:26 butterflies was was a huge I think they
49:28 have like two two data sets maybe or
49:31 maybe 20. They have this one this one
49:34 guy that have this data set butterfly
49:36 that is like a light. Another one is the
49:38 whole thing. And I think I downloaded
49:40 the whole thing to to have to make a
49:42 better prediction. But at the end
49:45 I think
49:47 could with tens or flow could could work
49:50 well in neither of those 21 on the the
49:54 small data set like the same thing you
49:55 you
49:57 do in the course like you use the small
49:59 data set with the with the clothing and
50:01 doesn't matter
50:02 like with the restnet I think 85 does a
50:06 good job
50:07 for that. Yeah.
50:08 Yeah. This year we'll do PyTorch
50:12 in addition to TensorFlow. So if you're
50:14 interested, you can check it out.
50:16 Oh, maybe I will. Yeah,
50:18 I I I don't I don't like P by uh PyTorch
50:22 because it's too verbose.
50:24 Yeah, me too. Like I also don't like it.
50:27 But it seems right now it's more popular
50:30 and people have been constantly asking
50:33 for an update to switch to PyTorch. And
50:35 I see that many students actually what
50:38 they do is instead of using PyTorch or
50:40 instead of using TensorFlow for the
50:42 course module, they redo it in PyTorch.
50:44 And I thought, oh, I just I might just
50:46 as well uh record a webinar and show how
50:49 to do it in PyTorch.
50:52 No, maybe I will.
50:54 Yeah,
50:54 I think I'm a little not busy. And and
50:57 this one is the I what I like of the ML
51:00 is is is big and you have like I did
51:03 three projects at the end when I took
51:05 them I think something good. I did the
51:08 the middle and I did the the other two
51:10 at the end. I did
51:13 Yeah. Because I think the the other one
51:15 I took one in that I liked um was
51:20 something about uh
51:23 EDC is I got the data set the same in a
51:27 in a Chicago competition. I download the
51:29 data and and I remember going to the
51:34 data to make to make the model. That was
51:36 really interesting because more about
51:37 the the analytics part of the of the
51:40 project to be able to to analyze the
51:43 data to more feature engineering and
51:46 apply that and put it in like I said in
51:49 in the cloud is
51:51 is just awesome.
51:53 Yeah. Another thing this year we will
51:55 have is instead of using tensorflow
51:57 light we will use onx which is a thing
52:01 that uh it's kind of similar but it
52:04 works with tensorflow it works with
52:05 pytorch it works with um mxnet it works
52:09 with other frameworks.
52:11 So you train a model with some framework
52:13 you export it tox and then you can serve
52:16 it with ox. So if you're interested you
52:19 can check it out. We are
52:21 we we did quite a few updates this year.
52:24 Oh, that's good to know because uh I
52:27 think I I could take it and I think
52:28 already have a couple of
52:32 projects that I could that I that I
52:34 didn't finish. You know, you start doing
52:36 something and just stop in the middle
52:38 and do something else
52:40 to finish that
52:42 because it's really good. As I said,
52:44 everybody that's watching,
52:45 it's the best course you can take. you
52:47 don't really have to take this one and
52:48 maybe you take another one in data talks
52:50 and you're good to go. You don't need to
52:53 to pay data talks uh to sorry to pay
52:56 data camp for for a year to be able to
52:59 get this because it's the same you
53:02 you're going to have the knowledge those
53:03 good platforms you're going to have the
53:04 knowledge you will be able to do
53:06 everything in a Jupyter notebook and
53:09 done and when you finish you're going to
53:11 be in the same place because the hardest
53:13 part is not to make the model is for me
53:17 is use the model to make the thing that
53:20 you made
53:23 for others to use to be able to deploy
53:25 that and and in in our field is more
53:29 complex. Doing machine learning model is
53:32 not enough anymore. You need to do all
53:35 other stuff like you need to know docker
53:37 and you need to know to know to connect
53:38 the database and you need to know to
53:41 know a little bit of cloud and you to
53:43 able to deploy that and you need to know
53:45 what a BM is and and all that stuff that
53:48 is is really important because at the
53:50 end is the way you will solve the
53:53 problem. The problem is not just to
53:55 create the mail. The problem is to to
53:57 make everybody to know how you solve the
54:00 problem. Like if if you know how to
54:02 solve the world hungriest people
54:06 everybody and you don't tell that to
54:08 anyone still no solution.
54:12 Yeah
54:14 that's an interesting analogy. Uh do you
54:16 remember what was the most difficult
54:17 part for you in the course?
54:20 What you were
54:22 I think the I the hardest part was
54:25 working with my M1 at that time. I'm
54:28 assuming that this is going to be
54:29 difference different one because it's M4
54:32 now. I think
54:33 I'm assuming that
54:34 that is going to be different. But the
54:36 hardest part was was that and I remember
54:41 having some issues with when the the
54:44 data set of the cars because
54:47 um I was I was coming from just doing
54:50 the analytics part and if I remember
54:54 that data set
54:56 there's a bunch of cars and I was doing
54:59 the dummy uh uh stuff with the data set
55:02 to make serious ones. was too big. And
55:05 some cars you were able to have in the
55:08 in the train set, but not in the test
55:11 set. And I was getting that error over
55:13 and over again because I wasn't doing it
55:15 the way you do in the videos.
55:17 And I remember I was like, what's going
55:19 on? Why I have I have this this error.
55:22 Ah, you use this part as get damis,
55:24 right?
55:25 Yes, I was using the get damis. And
55:27 because
55:27 Yeah, that's why I don't use it.
55:30 Yeah. And I remember one student from
55:33 Brazil.
55:35 He gave me a a Python package
55:39 that made the dummy things with numbers.
55:44 Um and use I think K&N to to
55:49 okay
55:49 to do that. I was really good because I
55:52 used that one and worked but I didn't
55:56 have get the same result and at the end
55:57 I went I went back and I did it same you
56:00 the same way you did it.
56:02 Okay. Okay.
56:03 Because Yeah. Because to was I think the
56:05 data set was too wide this that column I
56:08 have too many variables.
56:10 Yeah. Um
56:12 yeah, I think that was the the the issue
56:16 because it's not hard like you if you
56:20 have a week you can do it. The only
56:22 thing is like if you think that
56:26 in two hours you're going to do the
56:28 homework and done
56:30 I think you are wrong
56:33 because the idea is not is not doing the
56:36 homework. The homework is is there to
56:38 help you out to understand the thing you
56:42 learn that you have learned before. You
56:44 know, I I I usually did the code along
56:47 with you. What was I know I know that
56:49 was going to be like an hour hour and a
56:51 half of videos
56:53 and after that I start doing the
56:54 homework by myself. try not do it
56:58 without watching your videos, you know,
57:00 and and if you can without charging PT
57:03 with the documentation
57:05 and you have an issue like that one like
57:07 over and over again. Okay, just go back
57:09 to the video and watch it. But it's what
57:12 wasn't
57:13 wasn't hard that impossible
57:17 for me was the was hard enough to make
57:21 me learn and learn new things.
57:26 Um, but not hard enough to to make me
57:29 like I know I'm not gonna do this,
57:30 right? Because it's too hard. And was it
57:33 easy enough? Like, yeah, I'm not even
57:35 want to watch the video. It's too easy.
57:37 Um, like was that in that middle was a
57:40 little bit challenging? Was like some
57:43 stuff like were easier, but there some
57:45 stuff that was a little harder or I have
57:47 to spend more time uh doing the cloud
57:49 was maybe the things that I have to
57:51 spend more time watching those videos
57:53 slower. uh slow down the videos and do
57:56 it with you because I didn't have the
57:59 knowledge but was I think was very
58:02 balanced. The course is very balanced
58:04 that at at thin at level I was at that
58:07 time like if you don't know Python it's
58:09 going to be awful. um if you don't know
58:12 any other programming language, if you
58:14 don't know Java, it's going to be
58:15 simpler or C++, right?
58:17 But if you don't know anything, you will
58:21 need to spend at least five hours a day
58:23 and watch the video twice. But if you
58:26 are like middle like advance in Python,
58:30 I think strike the balance between the
58:33 things you need to a little work a
58:35 little harder. Um, but it's not that
58:39 hard that you just give up. And the
58:42 slack is awesome, right? The slack in
58:46 the community in data talks is just
58:48 awesome. Not only with all those years,
58:51 the question probably probably will be
58:53 there in your Q&A and the body's going
58:56 to answer with answer. But if not,
59:00 somebody's is answering you. Somebody's
59:03 gonna tell you how they did it and
59:05 nobody's is going to give you the
59:06 the answer on top of that. Like it's
59:09 like I wish we have this type of slack
59:12 in university.
59:15 Nobody nobody comment anything maybe one
59:18 comment and after three weeks somebody
59:21 say something but a slack is very fast.
59:23 I remember
59:25 having a questions put it there waiting
59:27 10 minutes and have like 20 answers.
59:30 Okay, that's
59:32 even I think we study we study with a
59:35 couple of times with with some with a
59:38 with with some guy in in Brazil. We
59:40 study we make like a study group like
59:42 two or three times and and I remember
59:45 talking with one person in Spanish that
59:47 I couldn't understand something
59:49 and he saw that when I was living in
59:51 Mexico and asked me in Spanish directly
59:55 was like okay it's good.
59:58 Okay. Well, we should be wrapping up.
1:00:00 Maybe last thing I want to ask you.
1:00:03 Um,
1:00:04 how did you manage to stay motivated?
1:00:07 So, this is a long course. There are
1:00:08 some challenges
1:00:10 like the challenges you described.
1:00:12 Um,
1:00:13 and this is like it's from September
1:00:15 till end of January. So, it's like four
1:00:18 or five months.
1:00:19 How did you manage to stay motivated?
1:00:21 What you would recommend other people do
1:00:24 also to stay motivated?
1:00:28 H for me
1:00:31 for me is the learning public
1:00:37 being in the Slack. The thing is happen
1:00:40 in the Slack people
1:00:43 sorry answer the questions you seeing
1:00:45 that message when the the phone turn
1:00:48 your screen and you know people are
1:00:50 doing it. Um just just get that and and
1:00:54 think
1:00:56 in one month I'm going to be done or in
1:00:57 two months I'm going to be done because
1:01:00 what you have to be thinking in this in
1:01:03 this course is when I finish not only I
1:01:07 will have at least two group projects to
1:01:09 show to future employers.
1:01:13 I gonna have a set of a skills that I
1:01:18 will be able now not only to ru do
1:01:22 machine learning
1:01:24 and to understand a little bit machine
1:01:26 learning I going to be able to do
1:01:28 something with that knowledge as I said
1:01:30 I will be able to really solve a problem
1:01:33 I going to be able to to if I going to I
1:01:36 don't know predict something and give
1:01:38 that to my neighbor neighbors you will
1:01:40 be able to say okay now I going to do a
1:01:42 project and I going to put in a in a
1:01:44 cloud and I give that to my neighbors.
1:01:45 Hey, hey guys, you can I going to be
1:01:48 predicting the weather, right? Not only
1:01:52 Google whatever I going to this this
1:01:55 thing that going to predict the weather
1:01:57 and I'm going to give that to my to the
1:02:00 people around like I use it. Hey, you
1:02:02 have this Google in top of that my
1:02:04 prediction is better for example. I
1:02:05 don't know whatever you're going to do.
1:02:07 And now you can write a small
1:02:09 application,
1:02:11 simple application that really can solve
1:02:14 a problem and that's going to help you
1:02:16 to
1:02:18 to use it like and that is is something
1:02:21 that you're going to have at the end.
1:02:24 And the feedback please don't miss the
1:02:28 feedback of your other students like
1:02:31 they're gonna put their the projects and
1:02:33 you want to learn a lot just to doing
1:02:36 the evaluation of those project three
1:02:38 projects. That's a huge learning there
1:02:41 because you have to put that in your
1:02:44 computer and you have to run it. You
1:02:46 have to reproduce that. That is
1:02:48 something that happens in real life.
1:02:50 Sometime people don't think that it's
1:02:52 important but it is because that happens
1:02:55 a lot and don't miss that and and don't
1:02:59 miss the the the
1:03:03 community
1:03:04 you know if you if you for example feel
1:03:07 like it's it's hard just talk with
1:03:09 people you will see that it's never easy
1:03:12 because stuff happens right life happens
1:03:15 sometime you get sick sometime sometime
1:03:18 you don't want to do it because it's
1:03:19 like or sometime maybe it's very hard
1:03:22 for you in that talk just ask questions
1:03:25 somebody's going to answer that like
1:03:26 it's not Alex is going to answer that
1:03:28 somebody's going to give you the answer
1:03:31 um and going to give you the resources
1:03:33 to do it and if you need in my
1:03:35 experience somebody's going to call you
1:03:37 and and going to go step by step for you
1:03:40 these other students write some some
1:03:44 post about whatever is going on in the
1:03:46 in the course like please just just hang
1:03:50 out in the Slack and and say, "Hey, I've
1:03:53 been really hard and you're gonna have
1:03:55 all the support you need."
1:03:58 Yeah. And uh I am really thankful for
1:04:00 all the students who help each other cuz
1:04:04 uh like if it was just me doing all the
1:04:06 help, I would not be able to do this.
1:04:09 But cuz when everyone is uh going
1:04:12 through the same model, people are
1:04:14 experiences experiencing similar
1:04:16 problems. and uh you share this with
1:04:22 each other, you help each other. This is
1:04:24 such a good not only this is a great
1:04:26 thing to see, but also it helps me with
1:04:28 my time, right? So I don't have to
1:04:30 personally assist every single student
1:04:33 when we have thousands of them, right?
1:04:36 Yeah. And as I said before that is the
1:04:37 one of the distinctions because like if
1:04:41 you if you go and take go to data camps
1:04:45 and take a m course there it's good they
1:04:48 have a really good quality courses. I'm
1:04:50 not saying anything, but it's going to
1:04:52 be only you. And when you finish,
1:04:55 you really won't be able to have a
1:04:57 project because you have to be working
1:04:59 in the their thing that is sanitized,
1:05:01 that is like is ready for you to to pass
1:05:05 the the the thing, right? And get the
1:05:07 certificate. It's good. I I pass a lot
1:05:10 of courses in that in that data camp.
1:05:12 But in that talk, you will have a real
1:05:15 project with real data. We're going to
1:05:18 be messy. You have to do a bunch of
1:05:19 stuff. You have to do the steps and
1:05:21 people will evaluate you and you will
1:05:23 see what others is doing and you have
1:05:26 that support and and you will can watch
1:05:29 the videos again and you can have the
1:05:31 slack that is a huge difference like
1:05:34 make really the the course works like
1:05:38 when everybody when somebody ask me why
1:05:40 should I text go to this page just take
1:05:44 the courses and you will be fine.
1:05:47 You have all the knowledge you need. Now
1:05:49 you don't have to watch endless hours of
1:05:52 YouTube videos, random people telling
1:05:54 you how to make a container. You only
1:05:58 have you only now you only have to watch
1:06:00 one, right? It's what made me simple
1:06:02 right now to I don't if I need if I want
1:06:05 to learn something about like now I
1:06:08 going to double check with Terraform.
1:06:10 I'm not I'm not searching Terraform in
1:06:14 in in YouTube. I'm going to the talks
1:06:17 and I know it's the third module. I just
1:06:20 go there. It's one stop and I know it's
1:06:23 going to be good. It's gonna have a good
1:06:26 quality and I will be able to use it
1:06:28 right away, right? Because going to be
1:06:31 real, not like some tutorial that is
1:06:34 like when you finish like I don't know
1:06:35 anything,
1:06:36 right? It's the same thing that every is
1:06:38 the same tutorial with different people.
1:06:40 Mhm.
1:06:41 This is really good.
1:06:43 Okay, thank you a lot. Uh we should be
1:06:46 wrapping up. Thanks a lot for joining us
1:06:47 today, for sharing your experience with
1:06:49 us, for sharing for telling us your
1:06:51 story um about your career, about like
1:06:54 how you discovered the course and how
1:06:56 the course helped. And what I personally
1:06:59 found very uh how to say what I
1:07:02 personally liked a lot is all the nice
1:07:04 things you said about the course. This
1:07:06 is very pleasing to hear, but also I
1:07:08 think this will be very helpful for us
1:07:12 that when we edit this and we can make a
1:07:16 bunch of posts on social media saying
1:07:18 hey like uh this is the experience one
1:07:21 of the course participants the shell had
1:07:24 and join our course if you yeah if you
1:07:27 want to have something similar. So this
1:07:29 is very very very helpful. So thanks a
1:07:32 lot for doing that.
1:07:33 No, thank you. you I really was I wasn't
1:07:36 expecting
1:07:38 um never in my life like after even
1:07:41 taking the courses that you um contact
1:07:45 me to to to talk about my experience
1:07:47 like um I'm but but yeah I have like
1:07:51 really good things that I said and and I
1:07:53 tried to do something that in Spanish uh
1:07:56 not not the same because I think we have
1:07:59 another issues in in in Latin American
1:08:03 with English because because everybody
1:08:05 everything is in English,
1:08:07 right? in Spanish. There even when I was
1:08:09 going to school there was in English and
1:08:12 there's not a lot of stuff in Spanish
1:08:13 and I was doing some stuff in Spanish.
1:08:17 That way if you don't speak the language
1:08:20 you will able to get the knowledge in in
1:08:22 a good quality and and and that is has
1:08:26 been the model or okay this is the way
1:08:29 he's doing it and it's really good and I
1:08:31 want to do something close to that right
1:08:34 and and when when I received the mail I
1:08:37 was like really and I would my wife they
1:08:39 talk to me that's crazy
1:08:42 but yes it's good is is it's just that I
1:08:47 I I think and I I've been a teacher like
1:08:50 I I taught classical music software um
1:08:54 Python um and that that that that
1:08:58 structure
1:09:00 having a little bit of model to with
1:09:03 other knowled my knowledge of of being a
1:09:05 teacher to to use that to be more
1:09:09 effective that is sometime I feel that
1:09:12 is missing like some people are having a
1:09:15 tutorial but they don't have uh they
1:09:17 don't have the knowledge how to
1:09:21 to inform the other person you know to
1:09:23 teach in a in a way that really helps
1:09:26 and that's sometime problem that people
1:09:27 just I can make a tutorial but they
1:09:29 really don't know the steps to do it to
1:09:32 use the right word to the exercises and
1:09:35 with data talks everything is like is
1:09:38 there the the the
1:09:41 homeworks are just perfect but the
1:09:42 project is just perfect and I was
1:09:45 thinking okay this is a good way to do
1:09:46 it that way because teaching in in in
1:09:50 schools I have the usually you have the
1:09:52 weight you exercises you're going to use
1:09:54 the book you're going to use and and you
1:09:57 are tied to that right and the way you
1:10:02 do it is like I was thinking sometime
1:10:04 it's like I think he was a teacher or
1:10:06 something because he's doing a good good
1:10:08 job to
1:10:10 to move through this step if like for me
1:10:12 what is if you don't if you never been a
1:10:15 teacher
1:10:17 right is hard.
1:10:19 Well, I have technically I have a second
1:10:21 degree. My second degree is English
1:10:22 teacher, but we never study things like
1:10:25 that. I guess for me it's just something
1:10:27 I was acquiring
1:10:28 that you learn. Yeah. That you learn a
1:10:30 job. It's like Yeah. And I Well, that I
1:10:33 was right. Yeah. But like the job you
1:10:36 have been doing is is is amazing with
1:10:39 with the with that actually I've been
1:10:42 waiting for the the next one is going to
1:10:44 be that you were asking for a new one a
1:10:48 new course about using React with
1:10:51 machine learning or something like that.
1:10:54 Um so AI dev tools I guess.
1:10:58 Yeah that one I was like been waiting
1:11:00 for that. I know react I but I I just
1:11:04 want
1:11:05 in November. We will start it in
1:11:07 November.
1:11:08 Yeah, I want to do with you because I
1:11:09 know it's gonna be good. It's like I'm
1:11:11 waiting for that one and I have a
1:11:13 friend, you know, yeah, I can I can
1:11:15 write some code. I Yeah, I can do it.
1:11:17 But but I know I going to learn a bunch
1:11:19 of new stuff stuff with
1:11:21 Yeah, but the idea there is not to learn
1:11:23 React, but more like use AI to write
1:11:26 some React without even knowing React.
1:11:29 So it's kind of VIP coding. Oh,
1:11:31 so you produce some React code, but then
1:11:33 at the end you don't really need to know
1:11:35 React to write React applications.
1:11:37 That's the idea.
1:11:38 Uh I know it's kind of shallow like at
1:11:41 some point you will need to learn React
1:11:43 in order to make React applications but
1:11:45 you can get started
1:11:46 without this knowledge right and then
1:11:48 eventually
1:11:50 uh as you progress as you build more and
1:11:52 more applications then you can start
1:11:54 learning it.
1:11:55 But it's a good practice and I think is
1:11:57 is good. I I think one thing that happen
1:11:59 with with people is like they feel like
1:12:02 they need to know more or when you watch
1:12:05 videos you feel that you don't know
1:12:06 anything and you know I one of the
1:12:09 application I write in in at microchip
1:12:12 that I I told you in the beginning I
1:12:14 wrote those in language know the name is
1:12:16 gsl is a scripting language for a for a
1:12:20 jump for software
1:12:23 um was a really
1:12:25 I did like three four applications of
1:12:28 those that they were using, they were
1:12:29 happy to you to use. I don't know how to
1:12:32 use it. If you ask me how ESL runs and
1:12:35 how I I don't remember I don't know like
1:12:37 now I I don't even put that after using
1:12:40 for two years in my resume and I wrote
1:12:43 like four or five applications. I I
1:12:45 don't know that right and it's something
1:12:46 that people need to start feeling more
1:12:49 comfortable.
1:12:50 Okay. Yeah. Okay. We should be wrapping
1:12:52 up. Thanks a lot for doing that. Uh and
1:12:56 thanks everyone for joining us. Uh was
1:12:58 fun and um yeah so if you decide join
1:13:03 our updated models and we'll see you
1:13:06 there soon.
1:13:08 Okay. I think I will. I think I will. I
1:13:10 think I will. Now on the new stuff, I
