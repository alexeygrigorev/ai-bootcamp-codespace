1:55 okay um so this week we'll talk about
1:59 switching careers
2:00 from physics to doing machine learning
2:02 and we have special guests today
2:04 tatiana tatiana is a computer vision
2:07 deep learning engineer
2:08 she is also a kaggle competition monster
2:10 and she currently works as a senior
2:12 machine learning engineer
2:13 at cork university hospital welcome
2:16 tatiana
2:18 hello nice having me yes um
2:21 so before we go into our main topic
2:24 of switching careers from physics let's
2:27 start with your background
2:28 can you tell us a bit about your career
2:31 journey so far
2:32 yes so basically i started my career
2:35 with phd in physics and then i worked in
2:37 science
2:38 and different institutes universities
2:41 and developing different optical systems
2:43 and lasers in particular
2:46 and then i started to have children so i
2:48 had two majority leaves in a row and
2:50 decided that during maternity leave it's
2:53 nice to stay
2:53 active and obviously nanophotonic is not
2:57 an option because you need a lab for
3:00 that
3:00 so a lot of my friends got very
3:03 interested in machine learning and they
3:05 started talking about that so i also
3:07 decided to
3:08 check courses on artificial intelligence
3:10 and machine learning and i actually
3:12 liked that
3:13 so i started with courses
3:16 and building them one by one and
3:19 eventually on maternity leave i realized
3:21 that yes that's what i want to do and
3:25 it resulted in the new profession so in
3:27 the career change at the end
3:29 and i also got some small internship
3:32 that brought me to that job in the
3:34 hospital because
3:36 i developed necessary links and in that
3:39 internship i was also doing
3:41 some machine learning project for
3:43 analyzing signals
3:46 for medical needs and then in hospital
3:49 they had quite a similar project so my
3:51 name eventually came up and that's
3:54 how i got in a position that i'm
3:56 actually developing
3:58 now the system decision tools that
4:01 decision support tool that help doctors
4:04 to
4:05 identify anomalies during the labor
4:07 process
4:08 and act promptly uh when a c-section is
4:12 necessary to prevent uh some
4:15 bad severe outcome during labor for the
4:18 fetus
4:19 okay that's uh i think we'll cover in
4:21 some more details uh because you
4:24 mentioned quite a few
4:25 interesting things in your uh in your
4:28 story
4:29 i think we will cover some of them like
4:32 how you approached your learning
4:34 a bit later but
4:37 i was like a few months ago i think it
4:39 was one
4:40 month ago i was checking my twitter and
4:43 i saw your
4:44 thread on twitter and after reading this
4:47 thread
4:48 i decided to contact you
4:51 and it got my attention it was really
4:54 interesting so the threat was
4:55 about 12 career hacks
4:59 so can you tell us about this threat so
5:02 what are these
5:03 career hacks yeah so basically on the
5:06 twitter i was
5:07 talking about career change because it's
5:09 very popular topic
5:11 uh you know everybody actually changes
5:14 career
5:15 at least couple of times in their
5:16 lifetime but the first time is always
5:19 tricky so people always worry like oh
5:21 career change
5:22 and they always ask questions on how to
5:24 do it and how to approach
5:26 that challenge and i was uh feeling the
5:29 twitter
5:29 uh with useful hacks that i learned
5:32 during my career change
5:34 i learned it hard way so i decided maybe
5:36 i better share my
5:38 experience so people can uh hopefully
5:41 speed up the process a bit uh using my
5:44 advices if they find it useful
5:46 so the first career hack and one of the
5:49 most important ones
5:51 is to change your social circle to be
5:53 careful about your social circle
5:55 so basically if you have you know
5:59 great friends from childhood and parents
6:01 obviously you don't change them but you
6:02 have a lot of
6:03 colleagues and you have a lot of shallow
6:06 uh acquaintance not really difference in
6:09 your
6:10 network and if they are not helping you
6:12 in in your career change if they keep
6:14 telling you
6:14 that you're gonna fail it's a bad idea
6:17 you have a good job while you're
6:19 changing your career
6:20 changing career and maternity leave that
6:22 does not work nobody does it you know
6:25 in this case this uh circle doesn't
6:28 really help you and
6:30 it's important to cut off such social
6:32 interactions
6:34 and then you will have a space for new
6:36 people to come into your life because
6:37 you will have more free time than
6:39 and uh then you can be people
6:43 that are more supportive and that
6:45 already changed career and that can help
6:47 you and guide you through that
6:49 so that's essentially what i did i cut
6:51 off about like 70 percent of my
6:53 communications with
6:54 ex-colleagues and all those pessimistic
6:57 people who are telling me that
6:58 i will fail and change inquiry is a bad
7:00 idea and
7:02 when i stopped communicating with them
7:05 i started to look for options and
7:08 that's how i found the ods community
7:12 and i entered the community and that's
7:15 where i found
7:16 my new network in a career and not only
7:19 career now i also
7:20 have friends there and that was very
7:23 supportive because
7:25 there is a saying that uh your average
7:28 of like uh three to nine people you
7:31 you're friends with so it's important to
7:34 be careful in choosing your friends
7:36 and choosing your circles so and that's
7:38 what
7:39 that's a talk club community is also
7:41 about so if you
7:42 that you're developing now so it's it's
7:44 it's a to create
7:46 that kind of circles and that kind of
7:48 social interaction that helps you grow
7:51 the second important uh also important
7:53 hack
7:54 is to forget about your fears and
7:57 stereotypes because a lot of
7:59 people are quite afraid of change and
8:02 then they have a lot of stereotypes
8:05 changing career at 35
8:07 or you're too old changing career on
8:09 maternity leave that's not going to work
8:11 and so on and so on
8:12 those are not real those are just your
8:16 fantasies and they have nothing to do
8:18 with reality
8:19 so some people contact me and ask me
8:22 questions like
8:23 i am 26 am i too old to change career
8:27 and i'm like seriously you're 26 you're
8:30 not too old
8:31 and you're not old and 36 46 56
8:35 and you know you're gonna change your
8:37 career because at 60 there is no chance
8:39 you are going to do the same stuff that
8:41 you are
8:42 doing today and that means that between
8:43 today and between your
8:45 your 60s they will be carry change
8:48 anyway so
8:49 just get used to that thought so uh
8:52 career
8:53 career number three is uh
8:56 forget about distractions that don't
8:58 bring value in your life
9:00 in my case i realized that such
9:02 distractions were
9:04 instagram facebook watching movies
9:08 even twitter and linkedin and those nets
9:12 are important for
9:13 pr but when you're changing career you
9:15 have nothing to pr yet you did not make
9:17 that paper or pet project or anything
9:19 else
9:20 you're just learning right so just shut
9:22 down
9:23 all the social networks you will see how
9:25 much time you have
9:27 you because you need to create a time
9:29 when you're on maternity leave you don't
9:30 have time
9:31 you only work when you have a chance and
9:33 if you're gonna spend time on instagram
9:35 and facebook you just
9:37 it's just not practical so you need to
9:39 cut off all those distractions
9:41 and some useful things like linkedin
9:43 you're gonna
9:44 use them later when you're ready but
9:46 don't open that when you are changing
9:48 your career and you are learning
9:49 because you open it for a minute and
9:51 then you absorb for 15 minutes that's
9:53 what usually happens
9:55 i think there are there are some uh apps
9:57 that help you do this like you can
9:59 have an extension for chrome that blocks
10:02 your facebook that blogs uh
10:04 your instagram or i think you can also
10:06 install something on your phone
10:07 i don't know did you use something like
10:09 this well i have a good
10:11 you know internal will but
10:15 well i don't know but you know if
10:17 whatever helps if you need
10:19 external think to block you from that
10:22 that's what they need usually yeah but
10:23 you know
10:24 just you know when i was stopping
10:25 smoking i also i got off smoking and
10:27 that's it i used to smoke quite a lot
10:29 like
10:29 back of cigarettes but i just cut it
10:32 as soon as i got pregnant and that's it
10:34 and same for here i just cut it and
10:37 didn't open
10:37 and now i open it again but that's
10:39 because i need that now for career
10:42 options and to find network and so on
10:45 so but not all of that instagram that's
10:47 it like
10:48 so the next important hack is uh
10:52 when you are changing career you have
10:54 this impostor syndrome
10:55 suddenly everybody is so smart they know
10:58 everything and you just don't know
10:59 nothing you keep
11:00 learning and learning and learning but
11:02 you still have this impostor syndrome
11:04 so because it's hard to validate
11:07 yourself
11:08 so the important hack is do not
11:10 overestimate others
11:12 and do not underestimate yourself but
11:15 how you're going to estimate
11:16 your skills correctly if you
11:20 change in career well you need external
11:22 validation right so for the external
11:24 validation i started to go in interviews
11:27 and because that interviews show you
11:29 which skills you lack
11:30 which skills you're good at and it helps
11:33 you to put your place as a specialist
11:36 with this skill set on the market
11:38 so go to the interviews even if you are
11:40 not ready to start the job
11:42 my mistake was that i was on maternity
11:44 leave so i was
11:45 waiting when elisa grows up a bit so i
11:48 can start working and that's i started
11:50 when i started to go for interviews
11:52 that was wrong i could have done it
11:55 earlier just for
11:56 external validation to see which skills
11:58 i need to
11:59 a bit uh you know increase and which
12:01 skills are actually okay
12:02 and to get rid of that impostor syndrome
12:05 but
12:06 the best thing to fight in poster
12:07 syndrome is not actually to go and
12:09 interviews yourself
12:11 but uh to conduct interview to be on the
12:13 other side of the table
12:15 and the good thing to do that is mock
12:17 interviews and mock interviews it's not
12:19 a real interview
12:20 uh there are platforms for that like
12:22 prom for example when you
12:23 interview others who are trying to go to
12:26 the big tech companies and so on
12:28 so when you're on the other side you're
12:30 an interviewer you're gonna see now
12:32 immediately all the weak places all the
12:35 weak sports
12:36 for yourself and that helps you a lot
12:38 because in in an interview process
12:40 then you can adjust your own behavior
12:44 that fits uh better and uh helps you to
12:47 pass the interview again
12:48 how does it help like when you interview
12:50 others how does it help to find
12:52 weak spots in yourself well basically
12:55 when you interview others and
12:57 the other person keeps on and on and on
13:00 telling about his experience you realize
13:02 oh my god i'm doing exactly that
13:04 i need to shut up
13:08 i'm talking too much as for me yeah so
13:10 when i saw it in others i'm like
13:12 yeah that's not good that's not good i
13:14 need to write that story concise in two
13:16 sentences
13:17 maximum three and practice it because if
13:19 i
13:20 am going like this guy you know that's
13:22 not good
13:23 and things like that or for instance you
13:26 uh
13:26 ask a person to code and a person
13:28 immediately starts coding without
13:30 thinking how to solve the problem
13:32 and you're like yeah i'm doing exactly
13:34 that i should not do that first you need
13:36 to think and then to write a chord it's
13:38 much better
13:39 so but you it's hard to spot it in
13:41 yourself it's easier when you
13:43 when you uh do mock interviews to others
13:46 actually
13:46 but we'll come back to that when we
13:48 discussed it in preparation but yeah
13:50 yes that really helps me because it also
13:53 was a change in psychology so i was
13:55 working in science and academics have a
13:57 bit different mindset to be honest
14:00 and when you come to industry the
14:02 mindset
14:03 is a bit changed and to see that to
14:07 sport that it's important to actually
14:09 have those mock interviews from people
14:10 with industry
14:12 so they're more like uh not more not
14:14 that much about
14:16 your potential and uh how smart you are
14:20 it's more to the point of which projects
14:23 you have done
14:24 that are similar to the project that
14:26 they need to do
14:27 so and it's a bit different tailoring of
14:30 the interview
14:31 so that helps it also helps when you see
14:34 others struggle
14:36 and you realize that your imposter
14:37 syndrome will actually disappear when
14:39 you start to interview others
14:41 because uh all your impressions that
14:43 everybody is ingenious
14:45 but not you will disappear you see aha
14:47 he's also have problems with that it's
14:49 okay that i have
14:50 it the next hack
14:53 is number five is uh attention genius i
14:57 call it
14:58 so basically in life you don't notice
15:00 everything
15:01 you're not capable of noticing
15:03 everything you notice only those
15:05 that you pay attention to and the thing
15:08 is that you can
15:09 choose what to pay attention to so you
15:12 can focus on positive things you can
15:14 focus on negative things
15:16 you did not solve the problem today you
15:18 can focus on that
15:19 or you solve that problem you can focus
15:21 on that some people will tell you you
15:23 will not succeed you will fail you
15:24 you're gonna have
15:25 haters it's important to cut off
15:29 attention from that
15:30 people and that event so whatever gonna
15:34 you know put you down just cut off
15:36 attention from that
15:37 you got a hater great don't pay
15:39 attention to him pay attention to those
15:41 who help you
15:42 and to your mentor and to you know more
15:46 important things
15:47 that bring value to your life in general
15:50 it's a good advice you know
15:52 so choose where to put focus of your
15:55 attention
15:56 the next one is make a team
16:00 so it's harder to progress just by
16:04 yourself or to learn by yourself
16:06 it's much more beneficial and faster to
16:09 learn
16:09 and to grow when you have a team of
16:11 like-minded people
16:13 and apparently you can create a team for
16:14 nearly everything you can create a team
16:16 to play haggle you can create a team to
16:18 write a paper to do the pet project
16:20 even to do the course some course you
16:22 can make it in a team together
16:24 so recently i had a course from venture
16:26 capitals in the team of five
16:27 that was fun because we could discuss
16:29 things together
16:31 and it's more fun to learn that way but
16:33 what is most important
16:34 other people have different kind of
16:36 expertise and you absorb that expertise
16:39 from them so when you're coughing with
16:40 great guys who know a lot about
16:43 other stuff you actually learn from them
16:46 much faster so and it's not
16:50 waiting for the team to come it's really
16:52 make a team so you want to make a team
16:54 you're going to find the people
16:56 convince them to play with you on cargo
16:58 or to do bad projects and to do that
17:00 paper you need to find win-win
17:01 strategies so you need to find people
17:03 who will also benefit from that
17:05 who want the same course or who need
17:07 that paper as well
17:08 and then when you are doing that
17:10 together you learn from them and you
17:12 help them and it's like win-win strategy
17:14 and that's ideal because it actually
17:16 saves your time as well
17:18 uh because it still gives you a result
17:21 like you have a paper or you you you
17:23 have kaggle master but in a
17:25 shorter time that you spent which is
17:27 also critical in maternity leave
17:29 how do you find these people like how do
17:31 you go about convincing them
17:35 this sounds great yeah well sometimes
17:38 people find me
17:39 actually quite a lot of times they
17:40 contact me and
17:42 now because now people know you but
17:44 let's say some time ago
17:46 sometime ago when i just started i was
17:48 finding people on cargo chat and writing
17:50 them
17:51 like one guy was from australia and
17:54 he seemed nice in chat and he was
17:56 nervous in cargill and
17:57 i could see that he programs better than
17:59 me that's what i needed
18:01 but he doesn't have a clue how to solve
18:03 the problem and i had a clue because
18:05 i've read the papers
18:06 so i just wrote to him that i have this
18:08 background like phd in physics and the
18:10 kaggle was about astronomy
18:12 so maybe we can benefit from jimin with
18:15 each other and he replied yes so he was
18:17 in australia
18:18 i was in ireland and then we started to
18:22 do that together and we got to the top
18:24 and then i invited one guy from moscow
18:27 uh who is a software engineer with great
18:29 experience and he was cuggling for a
18:31 while and that's how we got like first
18:33 silver
18:33 almost gold but you know it was good for
18:35 the first track
18:37 basically the recipe is uh the hack here
18:40 is just to reach out to people
18:43 reach out to people exactly the same
18:45 with papers i wanted to write a paper
18:47 but i didn't have material so i reached
18:49 out to a guy
18:50 from odeas who actually won a
18:52 competition
18:53 and i asked him can i please use your
18:55 quote and uh
18:57 you know write a paper base based on
19:00 that but i rewrite it and he
19:01 he gave me access to every century his
19:03 server even for calculations and
19:06 so and helped me with advices as well so
19:09 and then i i was looking for
19:13 somebody else to join to help me with
19:14 writing because i was short on time
19:16 so again i just wrote like a notice like
19:19 hey i'm looking for co-water who will
19:21 help me to craft a paper
19:22 and that's how alexander kalinin wrote
19:24 me and he is great
19:25 in writing papers really and he helped
19:28 me to craft that and to finish that
19:30 things
19:30 and it got accepted to cvpr workshops
19:33 that's how you make it
19:35 and you find win-win strategists so you
19:38 find people who all think
19:39 so reach out to people have something to
19:41 offer like have a clear offer in the
19:44 first message and then like if i
19:47 let's say if let's imagine station when
19:51 i won a goggle competition that never
19:53 happened but
19:54 i like imagining this sometimes if
19:56 somebody wrote me
19:57 saying okay awesome solution can i write
20:00 a paper about this
20:02 it's very difficult to say no right yeah
20:05 i also stopped this way and it worked
20:07 out
20:09 yeah and also if if you're looking just
20:12 if you don't know whom to contact like
20:13 in kaggle you you see the person so you
20:16 can write the person
20:17 or another yes uh in data talks club but
20:20 you cannot actually write an open
20:21 message like a linkedin hello i am
20:23 working on that paper i am looking for
20:25 co-workers so
20:26 um i need a help with this this and that
20:28 like do calculations
20:30 i i i have all the code set up i just
20:32 need to you know somebody running
20:34 experiments for me looking for a student
20:36 who can volunteer for that and have a
20:38 paper i can assure you within 24 hours
20:41 you're going to have a lot of
20:42 students from all places in the world
20:45 who will be
20:46 you know happy to help you with doing
20:48 that tasks
20:49 for the co-ownership you know for
20:52 example
20:53 yeah thanks so we are done with six
20:55 hacks right there are six more
20:57 oh yeah we need to hurry up sorry
21:01 no i think we have enough time so yeah
21:04 uh
21:05 less hack is um less is more forget
21:07 about perfectionism
21:09 so there is a pareto rule that says that
21:11 around twenty percent of offer
21:12 gives you eighty percent of the result
21:14 and that's actually
21:16 true so focus
21:19 you know all your efforts where you're
21:22 gonna gain that result so if
21:24 but there are those you know minor
21:26 things that you need to finish but they
21:27 can take you
21:28 enormous amount of time maybe you're not
21:30 good at that maybe you don't know
21:32 anything about that
21:33 well outsource it delegate it find that
21:35 win-win strategy get a team
21:38 the best is to focus your energy on
21:41 those 20
21:43 that bring eighty percent of results in
21:45 your case
21:46 and for instance if you are not a
21:47 front-end developer and at the end you
21:49 need to do something on front-end
21:51 find a front-ender find that win-win
21:53 strategy or
21:54 outsource it or pay for that delegated
21:57 whatever
21:58 and forget about being perfect because
22:00 nobody
22:02 is perfect and that perfectionism it
22:04 takes a lot of extra time and you simply
22:07 don't have it if you're changing korean
22:08 maternity leave you have no time so you
22:10 have to be careful
22:11 on how you spend it the next one
22:14 oh sorry i just have a like maybe it's
22:17 actually important like
22:18 how do you find this 20 like how do you
22:20 even know that this 20
22:22 is important and this 80 is not
22:24 important like how do you
22:25 kind of see some things can you can take
22:28 you enormously long
22:29 for instance if if you're just not good
22:32 at that or don't know how to make it
22:34 completely they can take you enormously
22:35 long
22:36 and if this is not something that's
22:38 gonna contribute to your future career
22:40 if not if this is not that skill set
22:41 that you actually require
22:43 then the wise thing is instead of
22:45 spending then a lot of time of learning
22:47 all that new framework or whatever
22:49 that you are not going to use anyway
22:52 it just to outsource it but of course
22:55 there are cases when you want to learn
22:56 these new skills and then it's a
22:58 different story
22:59 so okay and i guess you're not learning
23:02 front-end or you don't need java yes so
23:04 spending a lot of time of
23:05 uh you know kind of low and all that and
23:09 doing front end as well
23:10 when you're not gonna do it at work
23:12 anyway so you're gonna forget about it
23:14 so
23:14 yeah and then one thing maybe like when
23:17 you don't know if it's something
23:18 you need or not uh because i imagine if
23:21 you're switching career
23:22 if you're just learning machine learning
23:24 or doing something like that
23:26 you don't know if you need to to learn
23:29 this topic
23:29 right like let's say do you need to
23:32 learn neural networks for this uh
23:34 project and i guess in this case you can
23:36 just ask somebody who is more
23:37 experienced
23:38 right yeah you need mentors so that's
23:41 that's another
23:42 hack okay
23:45 so the next hack is number eight it's
23:48 initial creation so when artist creates
23:52 a painting what happens
23:54 the first creation always happens in the
23:55 head the artist visualize the painting
23:58 he can actually
24:00 create it already in his mind and then
24:02 he paints what he created
24:04 the same initial creation applies to
24:06 everything
24:07 when you uh for instance wants to do
24:10 some
24:11 code for kaggle competition or to do
24:13 some code for your pet project or your
24:15 paper or whatever
24:18 when you have some free time so you are
24:20 working with a kid and so on but you
24:22 cannot work so you basically
24:23 your mind is free but you are not
24:26 working in the computer you can save
24:28 whole lots of time if you are thinking
24:31 about what you are going to write or
24:33 what you are going to code before so for
24:35 instance you are cooking dinner
24:36 and you are thinking how exactly you
24:38 will approach the architecture for that
24:40 machine learning solution
24:42 or what you are going to write in that
24:45 paper or what you're going to write in
24:47 the proposal
24:49 and so on so basically you create it in
24:51 your head anyway
24:53 and during the day when you are busy
24:55 with other stuff you have a lot of time
24:57 when you can create it in your head you
24:59 just cannot get your hands on the
25:00 computer
25:01 and then an evening when you finally
25:03 have few hours to put your hands on the
25:05 computer
25:05 you've already created all in your head
25:08 so this is gonna
25:09 speed up you a lot because you just need
25:11 to do it but you already know what to do
25:14 do you capture this idea somehow or is
25:16 the they stay in your head
25:18 because for me like if i don't write it
25:20 down then they are gone like the next
25:22 minute
25:23 no i remember when i think think through
25:26 something i remember that
25:28 maybe just a question of habit you know
25:30 that's how i used to write
25:32 on literature or you know
25:36 little essays about literatures that we
25:38 had to write in schools
25:40 i would actually think and then go and
25:42 write so we'll be consistent
25:43 so it's useful um to somehow train your
25:46 memory to
25:47 to remember this but i guess it's uh
25:49 like even if you're busy with your
25:51 daily stuff it doesn't hurt to have like
25:54 an
25:54 a piece of paper and a pen well you
25:57 could
25:58 quickly you can actually have dicta
26:00 phone so sometimes i i just uh
26:03 you know turn on microphone and i record
26:06 things
26:07 come to my mind and they're useful so
26:09 just that i don't want to forget
26:11 so but anyway usually then remember
26:15 the other important thing that this
26:19 initial creation included also
26:21 visualization of your goals and of
26:24 yourself
26:24 so you want to career changing career is
26:28 also the project a bit of creating
26:30 yourself you you're creating yourself in
26:32 a way
26:33 at least professionally and so visualize
26:36 that end
26:37 that visualize yourself in a new job and
26:40 in your role
26:41 confident knowing what you are doing
26:44 visualize your goals
26:46 it helps a lot because you kind of trick
26:49 your mind
26:50 in in the state that it's already kind
26:52 of achieved
26:54 uh there is a lot of uh uh
26:57 practice about this is called south
26:59 kampa you know when you go
27:01 how it's called uh kampa and it's
27:04 it's a bit from buddhism and meditation
27:07 techniques
27:07 when you visualize your goal the idea is
27:10 that you visualize your goal
27:11 in presence like if this already
27:13 happened so
27:14 get your desire your wish whatever you
27:17 want and visualize it
27:19 and repeat it three times in present
27:20 sense like this
27:22 has happened and then go away and do
27:25 your meditation
27:26 and it actually some kind of works
27:28 because you trick your mind in the
27:29 things that it's already happened so you
27:31 start to behave the way that
27:33 if that already happened and like that
27:35 your behavior
27:36 actually makes it easier to happen
27:41 you know well for instance you want to
27:42 stop smoking just
27:44 tell yourself i don't smoke anymore i
27:46 don't smoke i stopped smoking
27:48 i don't smoke anymore and then the next
27:49 day you probably you know you tricked
27:51 your mind and
27:51 in future you know your brain will be
27:53 easier to to
27:55 uh not think about cigarettes you know
27:57 because you're convincing your brains
27:59 that you stop smoking
28:00 so just as an example
28:03 so that's number nine
28:06 number eight number nine number nine is
28:09 to find mentors
28:10 this is very important because mentor is
28:12 somebody who already passed the ways
28:14 that you want to pass or who is already
28:16 in the role that you want to
28:18 achieve or who is a person that you want
28:20 to become
28:21 basically a mentor can speed up your
28:24 process a lot you don't know where to
28:26 start learning how to do it
28:28 your mentor can help you with that
28:29 because he or she passed that way
28:31 and again choosing your mentors and
28:34 finding your
28:35 mentors comes to the hack number one of
28:37 changing your social circles you need to
28:38 find the social circles where you get
28:40 you will find some mentors and for me it
28:43 was so theirs obviously
28:45 when i found a lot of mentors who were
28:47 helping me
28:49 uh you know literally writing me the
28:52 plan
28:52 of what i need to learn uh what is
28:55 important to learn and sometimes i would
28:57 actually use
28:58 a crowd opinion as a mentor so i will
29:00 ask a question
29:02 uh to everybody and a lot of people will
29:05 react and then they
29:06 some people think this way some people
29:08 think that way but there is common
29:10 such thing as common sense so if many
29:12 people reply you the same thing you
29:14 think
29:15 maybe that is valid because everybody is
29:17 mentioning this for instance
29:20 so that is important so
29:23 you just reached out to people i think
29:25 it goes back to
29:26 the other hack about making a team so
29:29 this is how you found team members and
29:31 this is how you found
29:32 mentors right yes it's it's reach out as
29:35 well but
29:36 mentors is a bit different so team
29:38 members you create a team
29:40 just for short periods like for some
29:42 project
29:43 but mentor you actually ideally you find
29:46 him or her for a longer time for years
29:49 you know
29:49 so and for that case uh developing
29:52 relationships is a little bit different
29:54 so for
29:55 for making a team i just try to say look
29:58 i'm working on that project
29:59 uh i just need your help with this is
30:01 this uh are you interested in join
30:04 and if you're finding a mentor it's you
30:06 know i kind of just
30:07 write a stranger like hey do you want to
30:09 be my mentor
30:11 some people do that it's not how it
30:13 usually works so you
30:14 you communicate with people you ask
30:16 questions and then you establish those
30:18 relationships
30:20 and when you establish relationships the
30:22 person can become your mentor
30:24 but it usually doesn't happen at a sport
30:26 it usually comes gradually so
30:28 you keep asking people who who know more
30:30 sometimes i will i was asking all the
30:32 questions just to everyone and some
30:34 people who reply me in private about
30:38 you know information and then people who
30:41 were replying me often
30:43 you know i started to ask them dirty and
30:47 one mentor who who's really great he
30:49 wrote me directly like you can ask me
30:51 questions
30:52 about this topic if you want that is
30:55 great you know then it's kind of
30:56 inviting you you know giving you
30:59 opportunity to
31:00 to ask questions and he will advise so
31:04 you need to be active right so you need
31:05 to be asking questions you need you need
31:07 to be active you need to be visible
31:09 and uh and it's always personal so
31:12 nobody is going to mentor you
31:14 if you she does not like you and if you
31:16 don't like your mentor it's just not
31:17 going to work it should be also about
31:19 chemistry like some people
31:20 with some people you get along well and
31:22 with some people you don't so
31:24 those with whom you you have some
31:26 chemistry and mutual connection it
31:28 really helps like because
31:30 having a mentor is like having a friend
31:32 basically so
31:34 there has to be some you know a
31:37 similarity in a way
31:39 okay so yeah
31:42 the next one is number 10
31:45 it took me 30 years to learn to be
31:48 honest you have to learn how to say no
31:51 you have to learn how to say no to some
31:53 people to the projects you don't want to
31:56 do
31:56 people sometimes bombard you with some
31:59 offerings like
32:01 and at that point when you're changing
32:03 career you have lack of time
32:05 you you have to choose what to say yes
32:07 to what you say no maybe you don't want
32:09 to be a member of that committee
32:12 just now because you have other things
32:14 to do
32:16 because it's very easy to become
32:17 overwhelmed on maternity leave
32:19 so and they want you to be a committee
32:22 in crash or in school
32:24 as well as somewhere else and some
32:26 people ask you for other projects and
32:29 you just have to say no and choose
32:31 wisely what to focus on and
32:33 what what but learn to say no
32:37 to people and don't sign up for things
32:41 that you don't want to do just because
32:43 you're polite and you don't want to
32:45 really make a person unhappy this is not
32:48 your job to make everybody happy
32:50 you have to take care of yourself as
32:52 well so say no
32:54 when you mean no do you have some uh
32:57 something like maybe in north
32:58 well no then uh no more than one project
33:02 at a time or something like this like
33:04 how do you decide
33:05 when to say no like let's say something
33:07 interesting an interesting opportunity
33:10 comes up but you already know that you
33:12 have some other thing on your plate
33:14 right yeah well is this when you say no
33:15 or well yeah you you see if you have
33:18 enough now at the moment
33:19 and but this is interesting you can say
33:21 that okay let's reach
33:23 in one month currently i'm busy but
33:25 sometimes
33:26 things that have come up are not really
33:28 interesting so you have to be upfront
33:30 about that like no or sometimes you
33:32 started an interviews process so you got
33:34 like two three interviews but you got
33:36 some other
33:37 offers to do and you know you had some
33:40 other offers and some other options and
33:42 you see that
33:43 there is no way to continue no point to
33:46 continue this interview process because
33:47 you actually did not like
33:49 you know the team from the start just
33:51 say no
33:52 some people they just continue it to the
33:56 end
33:57 but i don't think it's really wise
33:59 because you're spending your time
34:00 of course if you have extra time you can
34:02 continue all interviews to the end
34:04 because you're going to have many rounds
34:06 and even if you don't intend to take a
34:07 job you can still continue
34:09 but if you really like your time and you
34:11 want to save it
34:12 if you after the the first or two
34:14 interviews realize that
34:16 you didn't like the team just say no i
34:17 don't want to continue to be view
34:18 processes i got other options
34:21 so it's fine so
34:25 heck 11 it's
34:28 do not be afraid of failures actually
34:31 look for them
34:32 a lot of people don't try things because
34:35 they're afraid to fail
34:37 this is so wrong i believe that only
34:39 through failures you actually learn
34:42 the best lessons you get is when you
34:43 tried something did not work out so you
34:46 made some mistakes you realize those
34:47 mistakes and that's how you grow
34:49 and so if you don't have any failures
34:51 you try new things
34:52 and you don't fail it means that you
34:54 don't try hard enough or you're not
34:56 ambitious enough you have to be
34:57 ambitious
34:58 get higher goals where you will fail and
35:01 that's because
35:02 that that is a grow you know growth
35:04 process so if you are not failing for a
35:06 while maybe
35:07 the projects that you are doing are just
35:09 too easy for you
35:10 and you need to a bit scale up
35:13 or you know make more ambitious goals
35:18 so then you will fail because failure
35:20 brings
35:21 a lot of lesson and a lot of
35:25 valuable information and
35:28 you really can build success on failures
35:31 but people are afraid of them i think
35:33 it's because for some people it's
35:34 painful
35:35 and i think that maybe it can be a
35:37 problem with agar if a person is
35:39 quite you know kind of have a big ego
35:44 and if the person fails he's like oh my
35:47 god
35:47 i was wrong here this is so painful i
35:50 don't feel
35:50 painful from failures to be honest and i
35:53 observe kids so for instance when my kid
35:55 tries something and it doesn't work or
35:57 it fails
35:58 he's never disturbed so he's never like
36:00 oh my god i made a mistake this is not
36:03 six this is five they don't feel pain
36:06 about that they aha this is five
36:08 okay so that's how children learn they
36:10 don't have that much anger and they
36:12 don't have pain when they do failures
36:14 you know
36:14 they fail and they learn so you have to
36:16 have this childish attitude a bit in
36:19 learning and be like a child but get
36:22 your anger
36:23 focus on learning and appreciate
36:25 failures that's how you grow
36:27 and i guess failures is like when you
36:30 don't pass an interview when you get
36:31 rejected right
36:33 exactly some people feel so much pain
36:35 about that you know and it's so it's a
36:37 bit funny because it's
36:38 that's how you learn you have to be
36:40 happy that you have failures yeah
36:43 and so it's difficult to to be happy
36:46 about this
36:47 so you really need to to convince
36:48 yourself but i think one of your other
36:50 hacks
36:51 was about that like
36:54 exactly focus on potentially i also have
36:56 children so i absorb them you know
36:58 my child says this is green i was like
37:01 this is actually blue first of all he
37:03 doesn't feel any pain that he made a
37:05 mistake
37:06 he says ah okay blue but i don't like to
37:08 call it blue let's call it green
37:10 so you know uh you can learn from
37:13 children a lot
37:14 they actually fail all the times that's
37:16 how they learn to walk and so on and if
37:18 the child will be afraid of foreign
37:20 he will never learn running you know so
37:23 you have to have that attitude because
37:26 that's how you learn
37:28 and that's number 11 and the number 12
37:32 i think it's the most important uh take
37:35 care of yourself
37:37 you have to have still sleep you need
37:40 support uh if you need some
37:43 help with your impostor syndrome agar
37:46 whatever
37:47 get a psychologist they're great in that
37:50 do some meditations take care of
37:54 yourself
37:54 you need to dedicate at least like
37:57 sometime during day when you take care
37:59 of yourself
38:00 because if you don't take care of
38:01 yourself it's your job
38:03 no one else will so you have to love
38:05 yourself and to
38:08 get your husband to make a dinner if
38:11 you're tired and go to sleep
38:13 ask help of your parents to look after
38:15 your child and get to sleep
38:17 if you need it so i'm talking now about
38:19 maternity leave but besides maternity
38:21 leave
38:22 uh anyway when you're changing career
38:24 you're gonna
38:25 need some help it's okay to ask for that
38:28 and it's okay it's not selfish anyhow to
38:30 take care of yourself because if you
38:32 don't take care of yourself you will
38:34 burn out and that's not a good idea
38:36 so this is important i'm
38:40 listening to you and some things they
38:44 are a bit contradicting each other in my
38:46 head uh
38:47 i'm just i'm curious like um
38:51 so let's say um so you have two kids
38:53 right you need to look after them
38:55 um so they need a lot of attention
38:58 then you need to you have some projects
39:00 like you're taking
39:02 part in kaggle competitions you are
39:03 writing papers
39:05 then you also set yourself ambitious
39:08 goals right
39:09 right you don't want to uh
39:12 you know like you you're looking for
39:15 failures
39:16 so you you want to set ambitious goals
39:18 and then at the same time you also need
39:20 to sleep
39:21 to meditate uh
39:24 uh like talk to a as you call
39:27 psychologist right
39:29 to fight this imposter syndrome and it's
39:31 just 24 hours
39:32 in a day like how do you find time to do
39:35 all that
39:36 yes so those are the hacks that i was
39:38 telling you so for the kids i hired
39:41 nanny
39:42 okay yeah you need help hiring nanny for
39:44 cleaning i hired a mate
39:46 yes she's coming and cleaning fine when
39:49 i'm busy
39:50 we get chinese takeaway yeah it's fine
39:53 to get chinese takeaway
39:55 my husband helps me in the morning chris
39:57 kids and sometimes in the evening as
39:58 well
39:59 because you know um but now you know
40:02 during day time
40:04 i can work but on maternity leave when i
40:06 was really with kids
40:08 then i was working after his job so he
40:11 finishes at five so it is and he takes
40:13 the kids
40:13 really helps me and i go to law so
40:17 and uh but it's still important to get
40:20 that
40:20 cycling round like few days a week and
40:22 so on and that's
40:24 why i was talking you about that first
40:26 initial creation so when you're cycling
40:29 you can think through what you're going
40:31 to code in evening or what you're going
40:32 to write
40:33 and that helps your time when you keep
40:36 the one important also thinks is uh to
40:39 keep focus
40:40 so when you start doing something
40:41 whatever is right and quoting whatever
40:43 learning
40:44 uh forget about distractions
40:48 that is the hugs that i told you about
40:49 twitter facebook and so shut it off
40:52 when you really focus on learning on
40:54 your project you realize that you
40:56 actually if you have just four
40:58 hours a day for concentrated work so you
41:01 start like an evening when everybody
41:03 goes to sleep until midnight
41:05 you're going to have a lot of done
41:06 sometimes people is focused work
41:09 they can accomplish the same as people
41:11 during their full-time working day to be
41:13 honest if you just
41:14 four hours straight into that so you
41:15 need to get into the floor
41:17 right you need to get into the floor
41:19 yeah and uh
41:20 it's also practice i am an artist in a
41:22 way so for me it's easy
41:24 so i when i start painting or something
41:26 um
41:27 you know if the plane will fall next to
41:29 me i may not notice to be honest
41:31 i can reset much into creation and i can
41:35 do the same in coding and writing and
41:37 learning
41:38 some people cannot do it but i believe
41:41 you can practice it
41:42 like artists do so when you're painting
41:44 you know everything disappears you're
41:46 just there it can be hours you know
41:48 suddenly three hours past
41:49 wow i made a painting but yes
41:52 i had time like from five till midnight
41:55 it's about
41:56 seven hours and for seven hours really
41:58 focused work
41:59 especially um yes then you get one hour
42:03 more for
42:04 cycling for instance for the sport and
42:07 so on but
42:08 actually not that much time that you
42:10 need especially if during
42:13 your day time when i was cooking and
42:15 taking care of baby and going for a walk
42:17 if i think through what i'm going to
42:19 create
42:20 that is enough and just don't work
42:24 more hours but work more and deeper
42:27 during the hours that you have that i
42:29 think you know
42:30 that is a hug that i should have
42:32 included actually
42:34 yeah before your next twitter thread
42:37 we have a couple of questions and i
42:39 think some of these questions actually
42:41 overlap with what we wanted to talk
42:42 about
42:43 so one question from arizona and what
42:45 was the mock interview
42:47 you mentioned i think it was pram prompt
42:50 yeah i can mention the resources for
42:53 maybe people
42:54 you can just share the links after the
42:57 chat and we will put them in
43:00 in this description um then a question
43:03 from alexandra
43:04 so what does uh tanya think about kaggle
43:08 versus omdanna
43:09 so do you know what andena is omdena is
43:13 a platform where it's like
43:17 it's like data science for social good
43:18 so they have some sort of initiatives
43:20 and
43:21 if you don't have any experience you go
43:23 there you have some sort of mentors
43:25 and you work for a couple of months
43:29 maybe one or two months on a certain
43:30 project and you get
43:31 help and you you really work with
43:34 somebody on a specific project so then
43:37 this question doesn't
43:38 well since you don't know what it is i'm
43:41 wondering if you
43:42 tried any similar initiatives like uh
43:44 like that one
43:45 well i tried that internship project
43:47 which is actually was
43:48 like for social good it sounds like a
43:50 bad project like internship
43:52 uh so um yes i can say about
43:55 kaggle like uh yes because we planned to
43:59 talk a bit about kegel so maybe let's uh
44:01 so i can say about kaggle yeah because i
44:03 cannot compare to that platform but
44:05 i can say about yeah what is pros and
44:07 cons for kegel and she can decide
44:10 for herself so basically kaggle can
44:13 teach you a couple of things haggle is
44:15 great for learning machine learning for
44:17 practice and muscle learning
44:18 on small relatively small clean
44:22 ideal data sets with quite good
44:25 distribution actually
44:27 so it's like a simplified environment
44:29 when you already have the data
44:31 and the tasks and the metrics are chosen
44:33 and you just
44:35 try different machine learning
44:36 approaches it can help you great
44:39 in starting off
44:42 in the machine learning because there
44:44 are notebooks where
44:45 you can read code of the others
44:48 and learn from that as well so
44:51 it helps you to learn exploratory data
44:53 analysis it helps you to try
44:55 different machine learning approaches
44:57 quickly you can try different
44:59 state-of-the-art approaches from papers
45:01 also quickly because some people will
45:03 publish it in notebooks
45:05 and some you will adjust and implement
45:08 and it helps you also to learn how to
45:12 you know create validation properly
45:14 because a lot of people in the beginning
45:16 they make mistakes and validations and
45:17 then they fall
45:19 in kegel on private leaderboard
45:23 so and it is a great community where you
45:26 can also find your teammates
45:28 and potentially mentors
45:31 kaggle does not teach you is all the
45:34 rest basically kaggle doesn't teach you
45:36 how to um transform business problem
45:39 into machine learning problem it doesn't
45:41 teach you how to communicate with
45:42 different stakeholders
45:44 realize their needs uh choose metrics
45:47 that reflect business metrics as well uh
45:50 how
45:51 which data do you need how much data do
45:53 you need where to find the data collect
45:55 the data
45:56 uh where to label the data
46:00 then that machine learning part you
46:02 haven't google but then kaggle doesn't
46:04 teach you
46:04 the rest like how you're going to deploy
46:07 that model
46:09 you know this make it all reliable
46:12 those cicd devops envelopes
46:16 and deployment and monitoring and
46:18 maintenance introduction like your data
46:20 shifted what you're going to do
46:22 how you're going to monitor that so all
46:24 that around
46:25 it doesn't cover so i'd say that if you
46:27 take a job
46:28 of uh in reality of machine learning and
46:31 deep learning engineer cover
46:33 kaggle covers like around 10 15 in the
46:36 middle when you actually just
46:38 play with different models and your
46:40 internship experience uh
46:42 did it cover anything outside of just
46:44 modeling
46:46 so for the for the projects that's what
46:49 i think that
46:50 it's important to have boss for the pet
46:52 projects
46:53 you have a bit wider things but it
46:55 depends on the pet projects
46:57 so for instance do you if you need to
46:58 collect the data decide what data do you
47:01 need how much data do you need send them
47:02 to labeling
47:03 that's one thing if you already have a
47:05 ready data set that's a different thing
47:08 if an internship project um
47:11 on pet project you usually also don't
47:14 choose
47:15 the topic you're going to work on but if
47:17 you need to choose it or
47:19 you can talk to different stakeholders
47:21 and realize the business
47:23 the business need and propose a project
47:24 yourself it's even better
47:26 so um pet projects really go to
47:30 production to be honest
47:32 but the difference with that project it
47:34 covers a bit more things
47:36 still and uh if you have
47:39 the mentor like on that platform that
47:41 she the way
47:42 you described it is that there is an
47:44 opportunity to have a mentor or
47:45 supervisor that's great that's what i
47:47 had and that's very great
47:48 boost because he can help you to start
47:51 and
47:52 introduce good practices and uh help you
47:55 uh to avoid some mistakes
47:59 uh by that bi-weekly meeting so how
48:02 often
48:02 you're gonna have them i don't know so
48:04 this is going to save you time
48:06 so that's why the advice is to do both
48:09 some bad project
48:11 and kaggle but the pet project instead
48:13 of doing just something similar to
48:15 kaggle it's better to do that
48:16 end to end so you find a problem that
48:18 you want to solve with machine learning
48:20 you find a person who can benefit from
48:22 that you convince that person
48:23 maybe not for money but you know anyway
48:26 that
48:27 you will deploy it at this person and
48:30 then you find the data you collect the
48:32 data you label it do that all end to end
48:34 you know when you have zero data and no
48:36 matrix and no nothing
48:38 and up to production when it goes to
48:40 some website or
48:42 to the server or at least pack it in a
48:43 docker so that's gonna be like
48:46 complete you know instead of just i
48:49 guess it makes sense to start with
48:50 kaggle because if you're
48:52 just if you're just if you just became
48:54 interested in machine learning
48:56 you are lost right so you know okay
48:58 there is this thing called kaggle
49:00 but when uh you will not be able to
49:03 convert the business problem into
49:05 machine learning terms you will not be
49:06 able to select a metric because you have
49:09 no idea about these things so i guess
49:10 kaggle makes sense for a start like you
49:12 start with chicago
49:14 see i was changing career after science
49:16 so for me it was quite easy
49:17 to think about business more because
49:20 it's still you know
49:21 after some korean science and after phd
49:23 and stuff you think that way you know
49:25 but yeah maybe kagal is better for
49:27 starting
49:29 and what resources for learning machine
49:32 learning
49:32 can you recommend a clean addition to
49:34 google i i guess kaggle is
49:37 a great can we call it resource but it's
49:40 definitely a good
49:41 website to check it's a learning
49:43 resource definitely
49:44 so just focus before going to cargo i
49:47 recommend
49:48 actually familiarize yourself with
49:50 basics so that
49:52 i was doing courses on coursera i really
49:55 love them from stanford
49:56 machine learning and deep learning by
49:58 andrew ng
50:01 those courses are quite famous and i i
50:03 really recommend
50:05 everybody to first grasp that concepts
50:08 before you go on kaggle because it will
50:10 be easier to learn
50:12 then because i was changing my
50:14 programming from matlab to python i also
50:16 did a course on udacity on python
50:20 just to you know get the grist for it
50:24 i remember the name of the course i
50:27 think it was python for machine learning
50:29 or something like that
50:30 or python for that for data science
50:32 because they were covering things like
50:34 pandas numpy and all those useful
50:36 packages you know you will not
50:40 know all packages in python it's
50:42 impossible but those that are mostly
50:43 used
50:44 i think uh one month ago we had a guest
50:47 on this podcast who also recommended
50:49 uh i think the same course
50:55 i can send you links and then we can add
50:58 the links
50:58 yeah then the next course
51:02 uh so you have machine learning deep
51:04 learning python
51:05 some people take courses on sqls it's
51:08 important if you want
51:09 uh to go in a position of data analyst
51:12 or you're going to work a lot with sql
51:14 databases
51:15 it's uh straightforward to learn sql and
51:18 it's also nice to do it systematically
51:20 so there is like two weeks course
51:21 that you can take and then
51:24 important course as well uh many
51:27 interviews
51:28 want you to do some coding exercises on
51:30 time
51:31 so and if you don't have a computer
51:33 science degree or you had
51:35 quite a lot of time ago it's nice to
51:38 check course
51:38 6006 from mit about data structure
51:42 and algorithms it actually covers corman
51:45 famous book
51:46 on data structure and algorithms so
51:49 those course and then i started to do
51:52 some courses for fun like
51:53 spiritualization on self-driving for
51:55 instance
51:56 but this is not needed if you really you
51:59 know
52:00 don't want it so we can send i can send
52:03 the links to those courses then of
52:06 course kaggle because it helps you to
52:08 practice
52:10 and then there are a few books
52:14 that can help you to understand you know
52:17 how to make end-to-end
52:19 machine learning pipelines and uh
52:22 you also need to learn system design so
52:25 there is a course broken system design
52:27 interviews it's more for interviews but
52:29 it helps you to to understand
52:31 in general uh how to build a large
52:34 scalable systems
52:36 and the reason you could say about
52:38 grocery and machine learning design but
52:39 to be honest i didn't like it that much
52:41 i think it is quite shallow it's not
52:43 really going deep enough on my opinion
52:46 i guess for this broken system design
52:48 this is something you take
52:50 really towards the end of your uh
52:53 like when you already feel comfortable
52:55 with uh other things
52:56 because i think this is more like a next
52:59 level like two levels
53:00 i mentioned they're more or less in
53:01 chronological order yes yes i understand
53:04 python machine learning deep learning
53:06 kaggle
53:07 uh than that mit course on data
53:11 structure and algorithm system design
53:13 machine learning design
53:14 and then if you want to learn how to put
53:16 it in production you can also there is a
53:18 nice
53:19 course on uh you know you can learn
53:21 flask or you can
53:22 learn uh fast api there is course about
53:25 that and there is course on javascript
53:27 and
53:28 depending on what you want to learn but
53:30 that's after you
53:31 mastered machine learning uh just by
53:34 itself
53:35 and you will you will understand you
53:37 know what is the next step
53:40 we have a question from aman aman
53:43 so what level of python programming uh
53:46 one should have before starting with
53:47 kaggle
53:49 zero zero
53:53 i know because that's what i was doing
53:56 it's okay i got kaggle masters
53:58 you'll make it yeah so basically what
54:01 you need is uh
54:03 to start you just need to start and
54:05 that's how you will learn it yeah
54:07 python is not like if you compare it
54:10 with other languages like java or
54:12 javascript or
54:13 i don't know even r they're so difficult
54:17 compared to
54:18 this is at least my perception they're
54:21 more complex than python python is quite
54:26 simple in a sense that there is not much
54:29 there in terms of syntax right it's not
54:31 overloaded with
54:32 syntax unlike other programming
54:34 languages yeah
54:35 i i learned java some time ago so i can
54:38 also compare yeah i
54:39 i did not like java i liked writing but
54:41 instead
54:45 yeah maybe we also have a tip um
54:49 and oh sorry a question um i think it
54:52 goes back to when we were talking about
54:56 having this focus time do you have any
54:58 tips on how to improve your focus
55:02 yes some people deliberately practice
55:04 meditation for that there is a different
55:06 types of meditations
55:08 some of them like the passion and
55:10 meditations meditations when you focus
55:12 just on breath
55:13 uh body is kind when you focus on your
55:15 body sensations and there are analytical
55:17 meditations when you just think about
55:20 some problem and just focus your
55:22 attention on that problem
55:23 so i think that kind of analytical
55:25 meditation is very useful for
55:28 learning how to uh think without
55:30 distraction about some technical
55:33 and problems i had the skill again from
55:35 school because we used to have school
55:36 olympiads and physics and maths when you
55:38 have four hours and very challenging
55:40 problems
55:41 and you sit there like for four hours
55:43 trying to get that you know
55:45 uh medal in
55:48 school olympics and that really helps
55:50 you to focus really straight for four
55:53 hours you know on those physics problems
55:55 but i
55:56 still cannot imagine i have just one kid
56:00 but he uh he can i
56:03 it's so easy to lose focus when uh
56:06 there is a kid like something i i don't
56:08 know like when he starts playing
56:10 uh something is uh he's he's very loud
56:14 and then
56:14 like even if i'm in a different room
56:16 just hearing that something is going on
56:18 like maybe
56:19 there is a furniture falling or
56:20 something like this it's very difficult
56:22 to stay focused
56:24 like i don't know how you managed to do
56:26 that i don't know i i can cut off that
56:28 as i told you i can paint and don't hear
56:31 anything i think well maybe i have
56:33 natural tendency for that
56:34 first of all but i think when you also
56:36 focus like buddhist cancer you only
56:38 focus you know on your hands legs and so
56:40 on
56:41 and if somebody's running something
56:42 happens outside
56:44 you just uh that's what you say you make
56:46 a mental note okay uh i notice that
56:49 sound
56:49 and you're coming back to your practice
56:51 and then again with meditation
56:53 and learning you to focus it's not gonna
56:55 happen in a week or two
56:57 and don't trust anyone who will tell you
56:59 it will but if you do that
57:00 for a year you will see the result so
57:03 you can train your brain to focus
57:05 it just takes time it's not easy it's
57:08 not like
57:11 but it's worth it i think because if you
57:13 can control your focus your attention
57:15 and your mind
57:16 you know those who control themselves
57:18 they control everything
57:19 there is a saying that the person who
57:21 control himself controls the world
57:24 so and that is a bit true okay
57:27 so there is no silver bullet you need to
57:29 uh
57:30 it's not just you you take a pill and
57:33 everything is great so you need to work
57:35 well there are some magic pills but i
57:37 haven't tried
57:42 i know in u.s a lot of students not a
57:44 lot but some students take
57:45 the before exams that you when they
57:49 prepare for exams and during the exam
57:50 some fields that help them to focus but
57:52 i don't recommend this way
57:54 and i never tried but i know that exists
57:56 yeah so we
57:57 have a question from saurav um so what
57:59 is your view on astr informatics
58:02 and uh do you do you know anything about
58:06 this
58:07 i was doing uh just some project
58:10 in astronomy so i don't i don't know
58:13 much it was quite a long time ago
58:15 but you you said your uh you your
58:17 research was
58:18 you mostly focused on lasers right in
58:20 your research
58:22 so not uh austria informatics yeah
58:25 because the question was about
58:26 if machine learning is gaining momentum
58:29 in this field
58:30 i i don't know if you know i just know
58:32 about astronomy because
58:34 that's what we published the paper in
58:36 and in astronomy it was
58:37 about you know in chile's before kovitz
58:40 in chile they planned to open a new
58:42 telescope
58:43 uh which is like much larger than hubble
58:45 and they're going to collect a lot of
58:47 data and the task challenge was to
58:49 classify
58:50 uh signals from different objects uh
58:53 you know can be stars or it can be some
58:55 other objects
58:58 that you get from the images from that
59:00 telescope
59:01 and yes indeed they they started
59:05 to look into machine learning approaches
59:07 to do that
59:08 and uh there are papers about that as
59:10 well so but
59:12 that's pretty much all that i know so
59:14 and uh but i believe that
59:16 a lot of fields now trying to apply
59:19 machine learning
59:20 uh in physics as well uh however
59:24 how successful it goes is still kind of
59:26 questioning me
59:27 you know okay so we have two more
59:30 questions so for some people math might
59:33 be a serious roadblock
59:34 i think for you it wasn't right because
59:36 you had this experience in physics you
59:38 also took
59:40 part in competitions you said when you
59:42 were at school
59:43 so you like for you i guess math wasn't
59:45 the problem right well for me it's just
59:47 a school
59:47 class yeah yeah so what part of your
59:50 math background
59:52 helped you the most for your transition
59:54 to machine learning
59:55 well the first year of university in
59:58 physics
1:00:02 so you know physics use much more
1:00:04 complicated mass
1:00:05 than machine learning so for me it's
1:00:06 like trivial mass compared to what we do
1:00:08 in physics
1:00:09 you know yeah i remember
1:00:12 like even differential equations for in
1:00:15 that we studied on second
1:00:17 course they they were quite difficult
1:00:19 and none of this
1:00:21 is needed in machine learning everything
1:00:24 is linear like almost
1:00:25 yeah maybe there are some applications
1:00:26 of differential equations i don't know
1:00:28 in time series or something but
1:00:30 in in general like in industry it's
1:00:33 it's quite uncommon to see more advanced
1:00:37 math and just
1:00:38 i don't know first course of industry if
1:00:41 your industry is aerodynamics
1:00:44 okay yes that's a different story but if
1:00:47 you're not in machine learning yet but i
1:00:48 think machine learning can benefit from
1:00:50 using more sophisticated mass as well it
1:00:52 just did not come there yet
1:00:54 okay yeah because now we have deep
1:00:56 learning you just throw more data more
1:00:58 hardware at it
1:01:00 and it just magically works nobody knows
1:01:02 how and why
1:01:04 i can tell you what i was doing in
1:01:06 lasers i would take a system of
1:01:08 differential equations which also has
1:01:09 some parameters so some parameters
1:01:11 the all parameters obviously have some
1:01:13 physical meaning but some of them are
1:01:15 not trivial to measure
1:01:16 so what you're going to do you're going
1:01:18 to try to twist those parameters to feed
1:01:20 the experiment so you're doing
1:01:21 literally like in machine learning but
1:01:23 you know with this system of
1:01:25 differential equations by twisting some
1:01:27 parameters things
1:01:29 okay so we have another question
1:01:33 um so for you with this background so
1:01:37 what did you need to focus on
1:01:39 um like what you would recommend people
1:01:42 uh with background similar to your
1:01:45 water folks i guess so math is not a
1:01:47 problem what was problem for you
1:01:49 not really a problem but i was not uh
1:01:52 programming on python before so i tried
1:01:54 my you know i i was programming on
1:01:56 pascal and java
1:01:58 and some other things and so for me was
1:02:00 actually learning python and
1:02:02 then i never had computer science
1:02:04 degrees so all those algorithms and data
1:02:06 structures i had to learn that's why i
1:02:08 really recommend this mit course
1:02:10 so and i'm still practicing on bitcoin
1:02:13 uh
1:02:13 to get a grip of doing that coding
1:02:16 questions well because
1:02:18 if you're in computer science degree you
1:02:20 probably uh
1:02:21 learn a lot of those algorithms and
1:02:23 practice them
1:02:24 most important this practice before i
1:02:26 never had that practice so it takes me
1:02:28 time
1:02:29 to get good at that
1:02:33 so we have a question from mike what was
1:02:36 the main reason
1:02:37 for you for living at the academy
1:02:40 i had two maternity leave so if you are
1:02:42 not active for five years and career you
1:02:44 can forget about korea anyway so i
1:02:46 decided that
1:02:47 i want to keep learning on maternity
1:02:49 leave and keep growing and developing
1:02:51 myself and that was convenient way to do
1:02:54 it because you could do it from home
1:02:56 you don't need anything i guess one in
1:02:58 resource one of the resources that i
1:03:00 didn't mention
1:03:01 you actually can get some access to free
1:03:04 gpus
1:03:04 using credits in amazon cloud and google
1:03:07 cloud
1:03:08 that they give occasionally on cargo
1:03:11 competitions
1:03:12 but also if you register account
1:03:16 on google you can get 300 free credit
1:03:19 for google cloud and you can also ask
1:03:22 quad for gpu and use it
1:03:24 so i was completely independent i could
1:03:26 do that
1:03:27 alone from home and all i needed was a
1:03:29 laptop
1:03:30 so two maternity leaves really kind of
1:03:34 uh that was maybe the main trigger for
1:03:37 that
1:03:37 i guess i have no idea
1:03:41 how it happens with lasers but i guess
1:03:42 you need some sort of
1:03:44 some special equipment right some some
1:03:46 love
1:03:47 to where you do experiments right yeah
1:03:49 you need a lab and
1:03:51 also in nanophotonics it's usually class
1:03:53 10 so
1:03:54 a class 10 clean room when you actually
1:03:56 dress up like the doctors on coronavirus
1:03:58 in china you know mosque and you have
1:04:02 goggles and you have all this
1:04:03 and because they should avoid
1:04:06 contamination and
1:04:08 on top of that there is a lot of
1:04:09 chemistry in making lasers and the
1:04:12 pregnant women are not allowed there
1:04:15 i know that hard way actually when i got
1:04:18 approximately no
1:04:19 i cannot do that i got pregnant so but
1:04:22 yeah
1:04:22 it's better if there are ladies who
1:04:25 watching this
1:04:26 please uh think about pregnancies
1:04:28 possibilities and future and choose
1:04:30 career which is okay with that
1:04:34 yeah we should be wrapping up so maybe
1:04:36 you have any last tips before we finish
1:04:39 uh
1:04:40 so well maybe i'll just give some last
1:04:42 tips for preparing for interviews and
1:04:44 that we did not kind of car maybe people
1:04:46 will be interested
1:04:48 about those so to prepare for interviews
1:04:51 the best tip i can give is to actually
1:04:54 practice
1:04:55 it as a mock interview and the resource
1:04:57 that i mentioned is prompt
1:04:59 but the best resource is also your
1:05:02 network
1:05:03 so talk to people who also looking for a
1:05:06 job and
1:05:07 you kind of interview each other because
1:05:10 it's nice to see it from the other side
1:05:11 of the table as well
1:05:13 and another for russian speaking
1:05:16 communities we can send a link to some
1:05:18 telegram channels and the telegram
1:05:19 channels people also meet
1:05:21 to mock interview on system design
1:05:24 and on coding and machine learning
1:05:26 design that type of things
1:05:28 to prepare for interview you
1:05:31 when you think that you're gonna go for
1:05:34 interviews soon
1:05:34 it's time to start practicing lead code
1:05:37 because
1:05:38 they ask a lot of those quoting
1:05:40 questions from the lead code but it's
1:05:42 hard to
1:05:44 solve them on short time if you have not
1:05:47 practiced before
1:05:48 it requires practice and lit code
1:05:50 probably means like couple of months
1:05:52 of practice so it's better to start it
1:05:54 in advance then when you are closer to
1:05:56 interview you can get a course on
1:05:57 grocken
1:05:58 system design interview and uh
1:06:01 on machine learning design unfortunately
1:06:03 on machine learning design there are no
1:06:05 good courses yet so whatever i've seen
1:06:07 was not quite happy with that
1:06:09 so but something is better than nothing
1:06:12 plus i had a great experience already at
1:06:14 work so
1:06:15 it's that was easy for me to tackle
1:06:18 and uh do again mock interviews on that
1:06:21 part
1:06:22 and uh refresh your data structures and
1:06:26 algorithms as well so basically those
1:06:30 are the main
1:06:32 things and i can add links
1:06:36 um after that to the resources to
1:06:39 prepare for interview but the most
1:06:41 important
1:06:41 is to come to the interviews so if you
1:06:44 even
1:06:45 don't want to start a job immediately
1:06:48 or you feel you're not ready you can be
1:06:51 always
1:06:51 ready to send your cv it's okay if
1:06:54 you're not completely ready before you
1:06:55 go to interview you try and fail because
1:06:57 before you fail around 5-10 interviews
1:07:00 you probably will not pass them so it
1:07:02 requires also to practice and
1:07:03 to gain that skill of understanding what
1:07:06 the person wants to hear and what
1:07:08 signals you want to show and how you're
1:07:10 going to show them
1:07:12 and that was also hack number 11. if my
1:07:14 notes are correct
1:07:16 look for failures right so you cannot
1:07:18 wait
1:07:19 apply to google tomorrow it's okay if
1:07:21 you fail you're gonna learn something
1:07:22 along the way maybe
1:07:25 okay so last tip is apply to google okay
1:07:28 well not necessarily google but facebook
1:07:30 if you're applying to big
1:07:31 tech companies and you file interviews
1:07:33 with them you actually learn as well
1:07:35 it's a good learning experience
1:07:38 okay so where can people find you
1:07:41 well i i have linkedin and uh
1:07:44 uh what else twitter
1:07:48 instagram yeah well i'm not instagram
1:07:50 instagram
1:07:52 on facebook but i don't check it yeah
1:07:54 mainly uh
1:07:56 my main resource is still linkedin and
1:07:58 twitter
1:07:59 starting to to look at twitter as well
1:08:02 so okay
1:08:02 and i'll i'll be um answering some
1:08:05 questions in
1:08:06 uh club next yes
1:08:10 thanks a lot and uh yeah thanks a lot
1:08:13 for
1:08:13 sharing your hacks with us for sharing
1:08:16 your experience your knowledge
1:08:18 i'm sure it will be helpful for many
1:08:20 people and
1:08:21 thanks everybody for joining us today
1:08:23 and watching uh
