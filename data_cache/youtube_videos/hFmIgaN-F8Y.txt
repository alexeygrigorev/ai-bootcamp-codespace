0:59 chat it's pinned click on this link and
1:02 ask your question and i will be covering
1:04 these questions during the interview
1:05 today
1:07 so i think that's it i didn't forget
1:09 anything i don't have any more slides
1:13 i was sharing my screen right
1:16 okay
1:17 yes yes
1:18 everything is okay
1:21 okay so i have my notes
1:24 are you ready to start yeah i'm ready
1:28 okay this week we'll talk about two
1:31 different roles we will talk about the
1:32 role of data science manager and we will
1:35 talk about the role of a data science
1:37 expert and we will talk
1:38 how they are not the same and why they
1:40 are
1:41 different and probably there are some
1:43 similarities as well we will cover that
1:46 in
1:46 uh this
1:48 this week and we have a special guest
1:50 today barbara
1:52 barbara is a data scientist
1:55 by profession
1:56 you're a data science manager right yeah
1:59 exactly yes uh
2:01 then um
2:02 gis it's geographical information
2:05 systems right yes right
2:07 you're into geographical information
2:09 systems this is something you studied
2:11 you'll probably tell us a bit more about
2:13 that
2:14 and
2:15 yeah so welcome barbara
2:18 welcome
2:19 yeah before we go into our main topic
2:22 let's start with your background can you
2:23 tell us
2:25 about your career journey so far uh yes
2:28 uh of course so i graduated from js
2:31 studies of geographic information
2:33 systems at the university in poznan
2:36 so i am a specialist in spatial analysis
2:39 and at the time i learned how to work
2:42 with very specific data which are
2:44 special data they are different
2:47 after graduation i
2:48 worked in telecommunication company in
2:51 gis specialist position
2:54 although i love this job after
2:57 a few years i decided to come back to
2:59 postline and find a new job and change
3:02 something
3:03 so i became a secret developer and i
3:06 learned very well
3:08 how very well how to work with
3:10 databases and reports
3:12 so and quite quickly it turned out that
3:16 my strong points are analytic skills and
3:18 contact with clients so i continued my
3:22 career as a business intelligence
3:23 analyst
3:25 being responsible for the analytic parts
3:27 of the data warehouse construction and
3:30 reporting projects
3:32 and i also prepared some
3:34 user visualizations and data analysis
3:38 and at the same time i also became one
3:41 of
3:42 the leaders in our bi department so i
3:45 also developed my leadership skills
3:48 but
3:49 always i felt that we could do something
3:52 more with data some advanced analytics
3:55 my goal was to gain more insight from
3:58 data and one day we decided
4:01 to build our own data science team so
4:04 after
4:05 some time i became a data science
4:07 manager and i got the opportunity to
4:10 build my own team and take
4:12 responsibility for the whole area
4:15 and now with my team we are building
4:17 machine learning solutions so this is
4:19 very short story of my career journey
4:23 oh what kind of solutions you're
4:24 building
4:26 now
4:27 we have two main topics um
4:30 one is modal
4:32 uh
4:33 which should predict uh for people who
4:36 are uh sick
4:38 for bipolar disease or depression the
4:42 your face will change or not
4:45 because it's important for doctors and
4:48 the other solution is small commercial
4:51 this is uh demand forecasting and
4:54 recommendation so inventory optimization
4:58 that's quite interesting yeah thanks for
5:00 sharing so uh i've been following you on
5:03 linkedin for quite a while and uh i
5:06 think you post regularly like every like
5:08 maybe every week every two weeks
5:11 i see posts from you then some time ago
5:14 i think maybe it was six months ago like
5:16 it wasn't super recent uh
5:19 i think it goes uh like a few months ago
5:22 yeah so you shared the link and
5:25 you shared the sort of post and the post
5:28 started with
5:29 do you need
5:30 a data science manager or a data science
5:33 expert can you tell us more about this
5:35 post
5:37 yeah uh i remember this post very well
5:40 and this post was about differences
5:42 between data science manager and data
5:45 science expert
5:46 and these two positions are often
5:49 confused even in data science world and
5:52 often uh people forgot many aspects of
5:56 managerial tasks
5:58 so
5:59 i often got
6:01 job offers from various head hunters on
6:04 nicotine
6:05 and job titles were data science manager
6:08 or data science team leader
6:10 but when i analyzed requirements i could
6:14 see that 80 percent of them were very
6:17 technical for example python programming
6:20 machine learning solutions deployment
6:22 kubernetes docker
6:24 advanced libraries such as tensorflow
6:27 python etc
6:29 and only 20
6:31 of the requirements had anything to do
6:34 with soft skills typical for managers
6:37 such as team management stakeholders
6:40 expectation
6:42 management communication building
6:44 relations and strategy for the company
6:47 so very often people confuse a data
6:50 science manager with data science expert
6:52 and i know
6:53 data science is a young field and people
6:56 don't know what requirements for this
6:58 position should be
7:00 and don't know what kind of person they
7:03 need in their companies
7:05 so i want to spread awareness and save
7:07 time in the process of building a data
7:10 science team in organization
7:13 who do you think creates such job
7:16 listings is it uh
7:17 like is it coming from management who
7:19 might not necessarily yet know what they
7:21 actually need from a manager or like who
7:24 usually creates this post do you have
7:26 any um
7:28 i think that
7:30 usually is created by some guys from i.t
7:33 and because it's head of id head of bi
7:36 or
7:37 somebody like
7:39 this
7:40 and he or she
7:41 uh doesn't know exactly how data science
7:44 works what is
7:46 more important in which position on
7:49 which position
7:50 um or sometimes hr
7:54 did some some job offers yeah and they
7:57 don't have enough knowledge about these
8:00 positions and because data science okay
8:03 technical
8:04 requirements uh team management okay
8:07 team management one point or maybe two
8:09 points
8:11 what do you think should actually be the
8:12 balance like somebody is looking for a
8:14 manager should it be
8:17 like that should it be 80 technical and
8:20 20 non-technical or should be different
8:22 uh should be different definitely
8:24 different i think maybe half a half or
8:26 something like that but um i think the
8:31 most important are this manager
8:34 theracore manager skills
8:37 so the the next question i have in my uh
8:40 list of questions that i prepared was
8:42 what motivated you to write it i guess
8:45 you answered that so you like many
8:47 headhunters were reaching out to you
8:49 saying hey we have this amazing
8:52 job as a data science manager you open
8:54 this job and then you see okay it's
8:56 it doesn't sound like a manager yeah it
9:00 happens
9:01 do you see such job descriptions very
9:04 often these days very very very often
9:06 and
9:08 i see this on linkedin and i see in our
9:12 different
9:13 job
9:14 websites
9:16 it happens very very often
9:18 do you think the reason it happens is
9:20 because these people want to find a
9:22 manager just don't know what
9:24 requirements to put or these people
9:26 actually want to hire an expert they
9:28 don't need a manager
9:31 i think it happens because people
9:34 need or want to have a data science team
9:37 and they don't know how it works and
9:40 they think that okay
9:42 we need a manager we need team leader
9:45 okay this is a data scientist with
9:48 extremely
9:49 strong knowledge of technical
9:52 issues
9:53 and okay
9:55 plus team management
9:57 this is not a
9:59 good
10:00 good way yeah
10:01 this is something like
10:02 a head of id head of idea is something
10:05 like different like a senior of web
10:08 development
10:09 expert development or
10:11 other programming stuff
10:14 so as i remember from the your
10:18 background story that you were saying
10:20 that
10:20 you
10:21 like when
10:22 you became a data science manager how
10:25 many how much experience and data
10:26 science did you have back then
10:29 uh before
10:31 yeah when you became a manager like
10:34 before this
10:37 it depends how you define the data
10:39 science
10:40 like all these things like
10:43 machine learning like all these
10:44 technical things that you mentioned uh
10:47 do you think it's important for manager
10:49 to know these things
10:50 okay so
10:52 before i was manager i worked um
10:55 around five or six years
10:58 general so because that's why i asked
11:01 what is the data science for you
11:04 because i worked three years like a gi
11:06 specialist and this is
11:08 very specific
11:10 part of analytic
11:13 but if you say that data science is
11:15 general not only machine learning but
11:17 general analysts yeah this gis also i
11:21 worked with databases and analyze
11:25 some data
11:26 prepared visualization etc so i think
11:30 before
11:31 i became a leader
11:34 i worked something like five or six
11:36 years in general in with data yeah
11:40 yeah but uh the
11:42 where i was going with this is i wanted
11:44 to ask you like is it really important
11:47 to get to know all these technical
11:49 things so you mentioned python docker
11:50 kubernetes like machine learning all
11:52 these technical things
11:54 like is it really important for a
11:55 manager to know all that to be able to
11:59 be a good manager
12:01 um
12:02 this is important to understand how it
12:05 works uh but in the
12:08 high level
12:09 yeah uh
12:11 maybe i shouldn't say that but i don't
12:13 use docker but i know how it works and
12:16 this is uh the most important thing that
12:18 i could uh talk with my
12:20 team we could discuss
12:22 because i understand how it works but i
12:24 don't use this
12:26 yeah and
12:27 i think this is the most important thing
12:30 if you have technical background and you
12:32 can understand how
12:34 different paths or technology
12:37 works
12:39 this is this is most important because
12:42 it is impossible
12:44 to know everything yeah we need
12:47 white knowledge but
12:49 quite shallow this is this is the
12:52 difference yeah experts need very deep
12:55 uh understanding very deep knowledge
12:57 managers need uh white knowledge but a
13:00 little bit
13:01 shallower than expert
13:04 yeah interesting yeah so express deep
13:07 knowledge uh
13:08 manager shall so they just need to
13:11 know a bit of everything and then know
13:13 what to ask for you know
13:16 and then they need just to go to an
13:17 expert and
13:19 exactly
13:20 yeah so let's talk a bit about data
13:22 science managers so who is with the data
13:25 science manager what are the
13:26 responsibilities and which skill do they
13:28 need to have okay so data science
13:31 managers help organization use data to
13:33 make the best management decision
13:36 of course
13:38 he or she has to know what skill set
13:42 and personality is needed
13:44 in team members
13:46 because
13:47 team means people and people are not
13:49 robots so we need people to feel good
13:51 together and work well together
13:54 so our managers need to know who they
13:57 need and who will fit into organization
14:00 and their team
14:02 they also show directions of personal
14:05 development for each
14:07 each team member
14:10 and
14:11 data science managers show the
14:13 directions of
14:14 data science team development and
14:17 prepare strategies for using ai and
14:20 machine learning technologies in
14:21 organization
14:23 that's why
14:24 we follow trends in ai and need a wide
14:28 knowledge of techniques in data
14:30 engineering data analysis
14:33 data visualization model buildings and
14:36 deployment ml ops etc yeah and
14:41 managers have a holistic approach to
14:43 data science projects
14:45 they don't
14:46 only know use technologies and models
14:49 but
14:50 they also communicate with stakeholders
14:52 and business users
14:54 they understand very well all
14:56 requirements of the machine learning
14:58 model and how it will be used by
15:00 business users
15:01 so with this holistic approach
15:04 they should identify new opportunities
15:07 to leverage data science in various
15:09 business area
15:11 so of course like every manager they
15:14 should be able to manage problem for
15:16 example with team members business
15:18 expectations weak results from models
15:20 etc and for that it's useful to have so
15:24 strong critical thinking and problem
15:27 solving capabilities so
15:29 this all combines soft and technical
15:31 skills
15:34 so
15:36 how much hands-on it is like two
15:38 managers actually sit and
15:41 code open jupiter notebook and
15:43 you know tunic z booster
15:47 sometimes sometimes
15:49 as always it depends on the structure
15:52 and maturity of the organization and
15:55 the united team
15:56 it's also connected with level of
15:58 technical skills and the background of
16:01 the person has
16:03 so if he or she has trained models
16:05 before or not and if not it depends on
16:08 his or her determination to learn to do
16:10 it right
16:12 and some managers don't have
16:14 time to write code and train models
16:16 others do it
16:17 but spend maximally 50 60
16:21 on the time old
16:23 but breeding model is not the core of
16:25 our duties and it's kind of ironic that
16:28 our tools are important excellent and we
16:31 do a lot of presentations
16:34 but
16:34 in my opinion a data science manager
16:37 should understand technical issues uh
16:40 very well analyze results promoters and
16:44 give
16:44 some tips
16:46 on the direction in which team could go
16:50 it's important to pose the right
16:52 question to the team and business
16:54 stakeholders
16:56 because it's common for a data scientist
16:58 to enter a rabbit hole and spend months
17:01 on model without any progress and good
17:05 manager can notice this and pull the man
17:08 at the right moment out of the hole and
17:11 say
17:12 this is good enough or show another
17:14 direction and this is much easier if the
17:17 manager has a good technical background
17:20 and you mentioned that
17:22 like if this manager has previously
17:25 trained machine learning models do you
17:27 think it's actually a requirement that
17:28 they have this experience of training
17:30 the model or they could be good managers
17:32 without this experience
17:35 it is possible uh
17:37 to be a good manager without this
17:39 experience
17:41 it's harder i think
17:43 but is also possible
17:45 uh it also it also depends on the
17:47 organization i know uh some organization
17:50 uh which is quite big
17:53 and i know that the head of it or head
17:56 of data science uh this guy is very
18:01 non-technical of course uh he did some
18:04 courses
18:05 he knows some knowledge but he didn't
18:08 has hands-on experience
18:12 it happens but it is possible um and it
18:16 depends like always
18:18 so probably like
18:21 like in your when you were saying what
18:23 kind of things managers do
18:25 so
18:26 um
18:27 thinking of team development thinking of
18:29 uh
18:30 like each members team member personal
18:33 development
18:34 then preparing strategies uh
18:37 then having this holistic holistic
18:39 approach communicating with stakeholders
18:41 identifying opportunities managing
18:43 expectations critical thinking
18:46 like none of them none of these seem to
18:50 require writing actual code right so
18:52 probably like
18:54 you can be somebody
18:57 people can be good managers without
18:59 necessarily having deep
19:01 technical background in the past right
19:03 yeah right but i think it's harder to
19:06 develop team and say which direction you
19:09 should go
19:10 or
19:12 ask for something
19:14 when you don't have this this background
19:16 yeah because when you discuss with your
19:18 team uh that you have some problems with
19:21 models for example and you don't
19:22 understand how it works
19:24 it's harder it's tougher
19:27 yeah i already see a question related to
19:31 the responsibilities of data managers do
19:34 you think data managers should be
19:36 involved with
19:37 business development and sales of
19:39 projects or not
19:41 uh
19:43 i think yes
19:45 because menage is responsible for the
19:49 strategy and how the organization
19:53 will prepare
19:55 um
19:56 different machine learning solutions
19:59 and for who and in which
20:02 business areas
20:04 i think yes i think that's why managers
20:08 have more time to do it something
20:11 different than coding
20:13 and experts
20:14 doesn't have enough time expert doesn't
20:16 combine anything yeah because if you
20:19 have all these responsibilities if even
20:21 if you want to code you just simply
20:23 don't have time because yeah
20:25 i know this very very well
20:28 and i have
20:30 had this problem many many times
20:34 and
20:36 another related question to what we
20:38 discussed is how do you make sure that
20:41 your team is learning new data skills
20:43 and they try new tools and they see new
20:45 applications every day how do you as a
20:47 manager how can you do this as a manager
20:51 okay so
20:52 my team is not so big uh maybe that's
20:55 why it's easier because if you have a
20:57 big team 20 30 people or something like
21:00 that
21:02 it's harder my team is quite small so i
21:06 see with them every week we discuss and
21:10 i i know what what they are doing on the
21:13 product
21:15 sometimes i see the code yeah
21:18 because we have a repository and i
21:20 sometimes i see
21:21 and sometimes we discuss
21:24 what is
21:24 good what's not
21:26 sometimes i ask for help some software
21:29 engineer because he has a better
21:32 programming skills and
21:34 he could advise
21:36 and after that i know
21:39 how good they prepare code
21:42 and i see the results of the model of
21:44 course
21:45 the second side
21:48 and i think that it's important to
21:52 say
21:53 for
21:54 each member in which direction
21:57 he or she should go
21:59 and
22:00 say which goal
22:02 in this year or
22:04 next month it depends
22:06 he or she should
22:08 do yeah for example
22:10 if we have some courses on the website
22:13 uh he or she should do i don't know two
22:16 courses free courses something like that
22:18 and i see uh
22:20 he or she did it or not
22:23 and
22:24 i see after that on the project how it
22:27 works and because one thing is the
22:29 course the other thing is commercial
22:32 project and normal life
22:34 uh yeah and i see and i discuss with
22:37 other team members uh
22:39 how how is good or not
22:43 so as i understood if i can summarize
22:45 correct me if i'm wrong so you're
22:47 with each
22:49 team member you individually work on
22:51 setting goals and then choosing the
22:52 right directions for personal
22:54 development
22:55 and then after that you pick a couple of
22:57 courses
22:58 that
22:59 should help with this particular goal
23:02 and then
23:03 the person basically takes a course
23:06 and they try to apply what they learned
23:08 in their
23:09 in their job right
23:10 yeah cause or sometimes uh if
23:14 if i think that uh it's better that
23:16 somebody learn from uh other team
23:19 members yeah that i know that okay
23:23 yeah they work in power and i know that
23:25 the senior help
23:26 regular professional
23:28 and after that
23:30 i discuss with both uh
23:33 how existing progress
23:36 yeah the other question is like hey do
23:38 you double check the work of your team
23:40 like uh because i think you you you
23:43 mentioned that you
23:44 take a look at the code
23:46 but
23:47 the reason you do this is because you
23:49 want to suggest the areas for
23:51 improvement right it's not like you
23:53 you're double checking i'm not double
23:54 check yeah they have code review they
23:57 have
23:58 different things and yeah i i see
24:01 sometimes but i do this i don't know one
24:04 per two or three months or something
24:06 like that when i'm very curious
24:08 uh but
24:10 i don't double check they are better
24:12 programmer than me so
24:15 do you think managers should do this or
24:17 it's not like how should they be
24:19 technically involved in that should they
24:21 review pull requests or if they want
24:23 they can do this right yeah if they want
24:25 they can do this uh but they
24:29 this is not obligatory i do this
24:31 sometimes uh
24:33 also for my
24:34 my development because i'm curious how
24:37 they code what is in the project and
24:40 um but this is not something they double
24:42 track yeah this is something oh okay oh
24:45 we have
24:46 another function yeah oh this code is
24:48 better oh
24:49 nice option
24:50 so it's more like for your personal
24:52 development yeah something like that and
24:54 i know that the project is is going very
24:57 well and oh
24:58 we have this function since i don't know
25:00 a few months off nice
25:02 so instead of spending the you know time
25:04 reading some articles you just go and
25:06 check the code oh nice like grab some
25:08 coffee
25:11 okay
25:12 and yeah so we talked about manager
25:15 and uh yeah so
25:18 we talked about responsibilities and uh
25:20 from the list
25:22 of responsibilities doesn't seem like
25:25 super technical so there are many
25:26 non-technical things and now let's talk
25:29 about the
25:30 data science expert role so what uh this
25:32 role is
25:34 and also when i hear the word expert i'm
25:37 thinking like yeah are we talking about
25:39 you know
25:40 the role after senior like you know we
25:43 have this usual progression junior then
25:46 the the
25:47 like professional or middle data
25:48 scientist and we have senior and then
25:50 there is a role after the senior so is
25:53 the expert somebody who is after the
25:55 senior is just
25:57 who could be a senior as well
25:59 uh i could say that generally yes yeah
26:01 expert after senior
26:03 um and the of course expert law is
26:06 different from the manager and
26:10 he or she
26:11 needs a very deep understanding of
26:14 algorithms and technologies
26:16 from the area in which he or she has
26:19 many years of experience
26:21 and
26:22 this person saw and resolved many
26:24 problems uh in this particular field um
26:28 and
26:29 very often
26:30 an expert has not only a good knowledge
26:33 of technology but also domain knowledge
26:36 yeah for example if you uh if somebody
26:39 prepares says forecasting um he or she
26:42 knows not only time series profit or gbm
26:46 but also how company how companies sell
26:49 and what could influence this process
26:52 yeah or if somebody works with nlp
26:55 he or she knows how languages work yeah
26:59 or yeah
27:00 or if an expert has
27:03 been preparing models for logistics for
27:05 10 years
27:06 he or she has got not only a deep
27:09 understanding of arguments but also
27:11 domain knowledge and this person
27:13 combines these two things very well
27:17 that's why i think that expert
27:20 very often is
27:22 after senior not always but very often
27:25 yeah so
27:26 they
27:27 know
27:29 one particular business domain quite
27:32 well they know what kind of organisms
27:34 work there what kind of i don't know
27:36 feature engineering usually works
27:39 and then like how to prepare your model
27:41 how to train your model and how to
27:43 actually apply this model how to deploy
27:45 so they know all these for this
27:47 particular domain very very very well
27:49 right yeah yeah exactly
27:51 exactly that's why there are expenses
27:54 yeah right
27:55 yeah that sounds very different from uh
27:58 from the
28:00 manager description right so it didn't
28:03 so the only kind of non-technical thing
28:05 was the main knowledge but i think if we
28:07 dig deeper it's quite technical because
28:09 it's about applying
28:11 this machine learning applying these
28:13 data skills to a particular domain so
28:15 it's about
28:16 you know using the technical skills for
28:18 solving business problems so it's still
28:20 quite technical right yeah this is the
28:22 [Music]
28:23 experts are very focused on the
28:25 technical side of data science
28:29 so um
28:32 that's why it's different than manager
28:34 yeah
28:36 in this different site
28:38 yeah and so why might we need an expert
28:41 because it's not enough just to hire
28:43 somebody who is i don't know a senior or
28:45 a regular scientist
28:47 yeah okay so some machine learning
28:50 models are easier and some tougher yeah
28:54 and some are very very complicated and
28:56 you need somebody who can handle them
28:59 somebody who has a great experience yeah
29:02 and
29:03 this person could prepare
29:05 complicated and good solutions
29:07 spending hours optimizing some hyper
29:10 parameters etc
29:13 and in other case experts could be a
29:16 freelancer
29:17 and you work with him or higher from
29:19 time to time yeah and this person
29:22 advises
29:23 you or your team in which direction to
29:25 go with this particular problem
29:28 and
29:30 an expert knows the answer to many
29:32 questions
29:34 uh
29:35 from this domain yeah
29:37 or very often an expert is senior but
29:40 with many years of experience and
29:43 this person knows your organization its
29:45 problems technology
29:48 business processes very well
29:50 so um
29:51 he or she already knows what you need
29:54 and they could prepare analysis or
29:56 models very quickly
29:59 so that's why sometimes sometimes you
30:01 need an expert
30:03 and
30:04 coming back to our discussion um half an
30:08 hour ago when we were talking like a
30:10 company wants to hire a data scientist
30:13 and they think okay we need to hire a
30:15 manager and then they come up with this
30:17 list of
30:18 requirements 80 of which are technical
30:22 so
30:23 what do you think like if they want to
30:25 start let's say a team
30:27 first of all do they need to hire a
30:29 manager or do they need to hire an
30:31 expert and what kind of skills they need
30:33 to have for this particular purpose uh
30:37 okay if you are a big
30:39 organization because if you are a
30:41 startup
30:42 is different but
30:44 if you are a big organization i think
30:48 you need to person
30:49 manager and expert or a good senior
30:52 if you have uh luck you could find an
30:55 expert with a very very good soft skills
30:59 yeah and i don't know
31:01 and expert has 20 years of experience
31:04 and okay he or she knows technology but
31:08 he or she could also meet with business
31:11 stakeholders etc
31:14 but generally i could say that the best
31:16 way is
31:17 to find a
31:18 data science manager and data science
31:21 manager
31:22 will choose
31:24 senior or professional also next member
31:27 of data science team and this person
31:29 will be very technical and
31:32 i think this is the best the best way
31:34 for big organizations but i know that uh
31:37 very often small organizations like
31:39 startups they do it
31:42 in this way they are looking a senior
31:44 with good communication yeah with good
31:47 soft keys and this person is responsible
31:50 for the whole data science
31:53 stuff in inspectors
31:55 and how do you think
31:57 let's say somebody
31:58 so they agree with you that they need to
32:01 hire data science manager right and then
32:03 the manager would hire all the
32:05 uh like basically built it in
32:07 so what should be in the job description
32:09 for this position in your opinion
32:14 i think that
32:17 this person should be prepared for team
32:20 building so
32:22 experience and knowledge
32:24 from this field
32:27 after that uh
32:28 wide
32:30 knowledge about ai and machine learning
32:32 solutions uh
32:35 but not in technical way exactly
32:38 but in which business areas you could
32:40 use
32:42 them
32:44 the other thing is also
32:47 of course communication skills uh
32:50 writing skills
32:52 not always we are talking sometimes we
32:55 are writing emails
32:57 and this is different
33:00 of course
33:02 skills of presentation
33:03 how to do
33:05 a good presentation about everything
33:08 results from models but also strategy
33:11 business requirements etc
33:14 experience with
33:17 management stakeholders management uh
33:20 expectations management
33:22 and of course analytic thinking
33:25 uh because
33:26 yeah we should know uh
33:30 what kind of analysis we should do on
33:32 what
33:34 meaning have uh
33:36 results from models
33:39 and of it's nice
33:41 it's nice to have if this person
33:44 has
33:46 technical background or technical skills
33:49 but
33:49 it's more important for me for managers
33:53 that
33:54 this person will understand how ai or
33:57 machine learning
33:59 works
34:00 not how to write a code
34:03 and let's say some organization so like
34:06 they come up with a job description like
34:09 you
34:10 saw like you saw quite a few of them
34:13 and they managed to hire somebody so
34:15 they hire an expert
34:17 and
34:18 so they actually need a manager but they
34:20 hire an expert right with this job
34:22 description which is uh
34:24 yeah because the job description matches
34:25 the expert profile more than the manager
34:28 so the expert starts working and what
34:31 could be the
34:33 like what can go wrong here
34:35 like isn't it enough just to you know
34:37 hire somebody who knows it well and then
34:39 just let them build 13.
34:42 okay so i i see
34:44 two red alerts
34:47 one is of course team building
34:50 because
34:51 this is a
34:53 totally different job or
34:57 task
34:58 than technical tasks yeah you work with
35:00 people you should understand
35:03 how they work
35:05 you need empathy you need a
35:08 communication skill to
35:10 to talk with others and motivate your
35:14 team
35:14 and
35:16 and
35:17 you should build team but
35:19 team means not people who work together
35:22 but who cooperate together and they want
35:25 to work together yeah
35:28 and this is not easy very often for
35:31 experts because they are used to work
35:33 alone or maybe with one or two person
35:37 uh and this is not easy for them
35:40 very often
35:41 uh
35:42 the second that alert is
35:46 finding uh
35:48 business areas where you could apply
35:52 much learning solutions
35:54 uh because okay they have a
35:56 good knowledge about our goals
35:59 techniques etc
36:01 but
36:02 i'm not sure that they will find
36:06 the best business areas and they could
36:09 say
36:11 the stakeholders that is the best
36:12 solution and
36:14 with this solution the
36:16 their business will work better yeah
36:19 because okay
36:20 they prepare very very good model
36:24 very good ai solution but maybe this
36:27 solution is not um
36:30 appropriate to this business case or
36:33 maybe company needs something different
36:36 yeah for example i don't know they build
36:38 chatbots
36:39 is perfect it's great but organizations
36:43 needed something more
36:45 uh or something different
36:47 not chatbots okay tugboat is okay nice
36:49 it was cool but they needed salesforce
36:54 yeah so basically there should be
36:56 somebody who
36:57 can translate the actual business need
37:00 into
37:02 like a machine learning problem right
37:04 and then the expert is not necessarily
37:07 the right person to do that because they
37:10 might not be
37:11 able to do this maybe they don't have
37:13 the like you know they don't have the
37:15 big picture they don't know
37:17 what exactly they
37:20 the the company needs right and then
37:22 okay but they'll just go and do this
37:24 chatbot and it will just solve the
37:26 problems
37:27 but it doesn't right yeah yeah it is
37:29 also the one additional problem
37:32 sometimes
37:33 that uh managers
37:35 care about relations
37:38 and we talk with different people from
37:40 different departments because general
37:43 this solution i.t solution needs not
37:45 only technology department but also
37:47 business departments
37:49 many departments
37:50 and
37:51 our job is also
37:53 talk uh with these people who care about
37:55 relations and understand very well what
37:58 is the most important for them and
38:01 sometimes is
38:02 very tough for experts because they are
38:04 focused on the technical side and it's
38:06 okay yeah that's why we need managers
38:12 yeah and
38:14 so a while back so you talked if it's a
38:16 big corporation they can actually
38:19 hire two
38:20 people so they can hire a data science
38:22 manager when they're starting a team and
38:24 then they can hire an expert so they
38:26 kind of pair them together
38:28 and they
38:28 [Music]
38:30 do their things but what if it's a
38:32 startup
38:33 and then maybe they don't have to luxury
38:35 their money too hard yeah and they don't
38:37 have this luxury
38:39 uh and very often they don't have even
38:41 luxury to
38:43 hire data scientists and data engineer
38:46 and that's why startups are looking for
38:50 data scientists
38:51 with
38:52 many skills and that's why very often
38:55 data scientists
38:56 are like a unicode really unicode
38:59 because i need data engineering skills
39:02 uh data science skills soft skills to
39:05 communicate
39:06 uh to do presentation uh at satire
39:09 and
39:11 i think the startups should to find
39:16 somebody who is
39:17 focused on this domain from startup of
39:21 startup
39:23 with good communication and quite good
39:26 knowledge of taking our side maybe not
39:28 expert yeah maybe not somebody who knows
39:32 every details in algo it's more in tech
39:36 technology
39:37 but
39:38 the the level is quite good enough the
39:40 first models will be good enough
39:44 this is uh maybe this is the best
39:46 solution for startups
39:48 okay
39:50 yeah interesting
39:51 but uh you know
39:53 startups just need somebody who can wear
39:56 many hats and are comfortable doing this
39:58 yeah
39:59 exactly
40:00 not everyone
40:02 would be interested to do
40:03 data engineering and
40:06 building action model and then
40:08 going and selling this to business
40:10 stakeholders saying hey this is my
40:12 awesome model now you have to use them
40:15 they say um how about no right
40:19 so yeah interesting
40:21 but in startups you have also um smaller
40:25 groups you don't have so many
40:26 departments so you don't need show your
40:29 models or show results i don't know 100
40:32 people yeah in startups you have 20
40:34 fighting it depends on the size ceo or
40:37 cto you show them and say okay let's
40:39 implement this yeah right
40:41 yeah that's uh that probably simplifies
40:43 things right
40:46 yeah we have quite a few questions and
40:48 uh most of them
40:50 i think are related to the role of a
40:52 manager
40:54 so the first one is prioritization and
40:57 deadline estimations are usually very
40:59 hard for a data science project i think
41:01 you can relate to that
41:03 is it your job to figure to figure that
41:05 out
41:07 like
41:07 how to prioritize things how to set
41:10 deadlines
41:11 and what is the process there for the
41:13 universe
41:14 okay so for me is sometimes a little bit
41:17 different because i work in the company
41:19 which prepares solutions for other
41:22 companies
41:23 so it's different if you work like an
41:26 internal
41:27 but in my job
41:29 i am responsible for um
41:34 prioritizing tasks
41:37 all we when we have
41:39 more
41:41 projects
41:43 on each project
41:45 i choose one person
41:47 who is responsible for that but always
41:50 i'm
41:51 looking from time to time
41:54 it's going okay or not with projects
41:56 yeah
41:57 and of course they could ask me what
42:01 they should do and what is more
42:03 important and we will decide or maybe we
42:06 decide to ask clients because it's
42:09 always
42:10 the decision of them
42:12 and how to estimate the the project this
42:16 is difficult
42:17 but i have one method
42:20 for that
42:21 and
42:23 i don't estimate uh time for each task
42:26 because it's very very difficult
42:28 you know you you sometimes you have
42:30 model after
42:32 uh
42:32 five times uh five tests after 20 tests
42:37 it's difficult uh to say
42:39 but i know how many times we know and
42:41 how many people we know we have to
42:45 do this
42:47 task
42:48 and
42:49 i don't i know
42:51 approximately how
42:53 many times generally they know they need
42:57 to prepare
42:58 hormone or whole test
43:00 etc so that's why i don't say
43:03 okay for this model i don't know we need
43:05 two weeks for this model we need
43:08 two weeks so one month
43:10 uh i know uh-huh okay we need one month
43:13 plus some buffer okay maybe six weeks
43:17 two percent free person okay this is our
43:20 tummy line yeah for example but it's
43:23 extremely hard and i don't do it
43:28 say
43:30 how many times every task
43:32 [Music]
43:35 so basically your role also involves a
43:38 bit of project management right so you
43:40 need to structure
43:42 project plan and then also monitor how
43:45 the project develops right are there any
43:47 bottlenecks and
43:49 how to resolve this bottlenecks
43:51 yes a little bit yes of course we work
43:53 with our project managers they learn how
43:56 data science works
43:58 because this is totally different like
44:00 the web development or other itis areas
44:05 that's why i sometimes i help them and
44:09 that's i also help them
44:11 because um
44:13 yeah all data science projects
44:16 are my responsibilities
44:17 so i and in the end
44:20 okay uh when we have some problem uh
44:24 we need of course project manager but
44:27 this is also my problem sometimes so
44:29 that's why
44:30 uh i help them all sometimes yeah so
44:33 they sometimes can come to you and ask
44:36 hey for this project how much time do
44:38 you think you need
44:39 yeah then you need to sit with them
44:41 together to figure out how much
44:43 time to allocate to this chunk right
44:45 yeah and how many people
44:47 we have
44:49 and of course uh sometimes they ask me
44:52 okay basha is this possible that uh this
44:55 task could uh be prepared uh i don't
44:58 know during two weeks or something like
45:00 that yeah because they don't know is
45:03 enough this is too long or maybe too
45:05 short
45:06 and
45:07 i could say
45:09 oh yeah okay with this guy or this guy
45:11 this is enough or maybe
45:14 it's too short we need more time we need
45:16 some buffer or something like that
45:18 okay so basically when
45:20 when a client comes to you and they have
45:21 some sort of mlai problem so then you
45:25 together with the project manager and
45:27 perhaps a client you try to plan this
45:30 whole thing right so this would be your
45:32 responsibility as well to also sit with
45:34 the client with and with the project
45:36 management manager to figure this out
45:39 yeah exactly exactly because of course
45:42 project managers are responsible for the
45:44 project but they need uh some
45:48 knowledge for me because they are not
45:50 specialists in data science they don't
45:52 know
45:53 which exactly task will be needed in
45:56 this particular
45:58 solution
46:00 and how do you make sure that your team
46:03 is improving the revenue of the company
46:07 wow ah
46:09 that's that's my mind
46:12 one more time
46:13 yeah so the question is how do you make
46:16 sure that the team is improving the
46:18 revenue of the company meaning that the
46:20 projects that you're making are actually
46:22 impactful and help the
46:24 your company and perhaps the clients to
46:27 you know deliver value okay
46:30 hmm how i'm sure uh
46:32 i
46:34 i ask many people i talk with people uh
46:37 okay of course we have some metrics but
46:39 this is math matrix yeah errors of
46:42 models something like that
46:44 but i
46:46 talking with clients and i ask them
46:50 i ask also
46:52 my project managers
46:54 because
46:55 they have uh others perspective on the
46:58 project yeah they talk with clients they
47:00 talk with our sas department
47:02 and uh they are not so such technical
47:06 guys and they see other things so i also
47:10 discuss with them
47:13 yeah i think
47:14 in this two ways i'm i'm sure that this
47:18 a good
47:19 direction yeah i ask clients it doesn't
47:23 matter external or internal because you
47:25 prepare this solution for somebody
47:28 yeah and i ask them
47:31 of course we can
47:33 we could prepare some
47:35 dashboards and i don't know if you
47:38 prepare
47:39 says forecasting uh you can
47:41 monitor
47:43 how it is good and the cells will
47:46 better or not
47:49 but
47:50 this is not easy in in business say
47:54 black or white and this is uh
47:58 the mode this is the result of the model
48:00 or or result of
48:02 other
48:03 stuff yeah
48:06 yeah
48:07 yeah because it's actually only a part
48:09 of the question that there is there is
48:11 more
48:12 so
48:13 the comment is it's more like comment
48:15 and a question that most data science
48:17 applications take time to provide value
48:20 so it takes time so you launch your
48:22 project maybe it fails maybe you need
48:24 more iterations before it actually
48:27 starts showing the impact
48:29 and
48:31 yeah so
48:32 and that's why they are costly like how
48:34 do you make sure that
48:36 the team is working on things that
48:38 potentially maybe in half a year will be
48:40 impactful but right now maybe they're
48:42 not so much yeah so that's why we need
48:44 monitoring always
48:46 after in each data science project we
48:49 need monitoring
48:51 uh involuntarily of models and of this
48:54 business processes for example this says
48:56 forecasting yeah
48:58 this size is better or not
49:00 but we should remember that
49:04 not everything depends on the models
49:06 yeah so okay uh
49:08 different ai solutions could do
49:10 something
49:11 but we have also
49:13 many different um processes business
49:16 processes
49:18 which
49:19 have influenced this process
49:22 and we should analyze this very critical
49:25 and it's not that oh our models works
49:28 very well because cells is better yeah
49:31 or maybe says is better because
49:33 now not now but maybe in december we
49:36 have christmas and we sell toys
49:39 for example
49:40 yeah but that's why it's very important
49:42 to have a monitoring yeah
49:45 this process
49:46 and also
49:48 you need to
49:49 have some sort of
49:50 like you need to know that the
49:52 improvement you see is because of the
49:53 model not because of uh i know your
49:56 maybe your sales department just start
49:58 working better and it's not because of
50:00 your model but because of the sales
50:02 department right exactly that's that's
50:04 why it's quite thicky to a nice
50:08 result
50:11 another question quite interesting uh
50:14 do you have a standard set of common
50:17 questions that
50:18 your data scientists use to interview
50:20 the clients
50:23 but to the class or to the eu
50:26 the clients the clients
50:29 yeah i have some some basic uh questions
50:32 always what kind of problem they have in
50:35 in the business
50:37 because uh some clients came to me and
50:40 say oh we need machine learning or we
50:42 need ai because we heard that machine
50:45 learning
50:46 will
50:48 some magic stuff
50:50 and i always say okay but what kind of
50:53 problem do you have yeah because maybe
50:55 you don't need much length maybe you
50:57 need only
50:59 moving average or maybe you need
51:02 some
51:03 good dashboard yeah
51:06 this is the first question uh other
51:09 question is always uh
51:11 do you have any
51:13 um solution for this problem right now
51:17 because sometimes maybe now you have the
51:19 size forecasting and new you have this
51:22 moving average
51:24 very simple okay
51:26 and
51:28 i asked about this because i have to
51:30 know
51:31 uh
51:33 they have some baseline or not yeah
51:36 this is a second question uh other
51:39 question is very
51:40 technical question in which technologies
51:43 do you want
51:44 [Music]
51:45 the solution
51:47 uh what kind of data do you have how
51:50 much data do you have
51:51 and how do you work with this problem
51:55 right now
51:56 because maybe do you have some experts
51:59 and they analyze everything in excel
52:02 or maybe they have some expert knowledge
52:04 yeah some uh wisdom or something like
52:07 that and this is
52:09 not in data this is not in words excels
52:12 or
52:13 in other systems but it is on only
52:16 knowledge of these experts
52:18 so that's why
52:20 i ask also
52:21 about this
52:23 uh
52:24 yeah i i asked a lot of about data
52:27 and
52:28 what they know
52:29 about the influence of this process on
52:32 the problem yeah this says forecasting
52:35 the best uh example
52:37 uh what do you know about yourselves how
52:39 it works now
52:41 and they you sell this every day or they
52:43 know
52:44 every month you have some peaks or not
52:47 uh
52:49 yeah how it works generally and yeah
52:51 this is quite
52:53 uh long
52:56 do they have any kpis already to see how
52:59 the process works yeah and sometimes ask
53:02 do you do you want um or do you expect
53:05 some
53:07 uh kpi or metrics because sometimes they
53:09 could say okay we need
53:12 error
53:13 accuracy or precision okay
53:16 i don't know 70 80 percent because uh is
53:19 the best solution for us
53:21 yeah
53:22 uh or something like that
53:24 i asked yeah i asked a lot about data
53:27 how many they have how it works they are
53:30 clear or not
53:33 what they know about their data
53:37 yeah
53:38 i think this is the most important
53:40 important question for the beginning
53:43 yeah and then the first question is what
53:45 kind of problems they have
53:47 and you said maybe they don't even need
53:49 machine learning and how often does this
53:51 happen that
53:52 they actually don't need
53:54 ml for that uh
53:56 for me it's not the usual situation
53:59 but some
54:01 more problematic is that people don't
54:03 have
54:04 good data or enough data
54:07 this is more problematic uh maybe
54:11 my customers are quite aware and they
54:14 know that
54:15 they need machine learning for this
54:18 because
54:19 right now they use something simple
54:22 yeah and uh
54:24 it's it's it isn't happened
54:26 so often but
54:28 it could be
54:31 yeah thanks
54:33 and maybe this one is also a tough a
54:35 tough one so why do you have any
54:38 thoughts on why females are still a
54:40 minority in data science teams
54:43 okay so from uh totally different part
54:47 yeah so yeah
54:48 for me it's
54:50 important because i also helped in one
54:52 of the organization women in machinery i
54:54 thought that's why i thought you liked
54:56 this question
54:58 yeah yeah uh i like i like about this
55:01 maybe not so connected with manager and
55:03 expert
55:05 but maybe it is actually connected to
55:08 you know
55:09 data science manager actually manages
55:11 teams and then how you as a manager can
55:13 uh
55:14 you know do something about that
55:18 it did not depends exactly for me uh
55:21 because uh i don't know two weeks ago we
55:24 had uh some discussion panel in poland
55:28 uh yeah we organized this with our
55:30 organization and with other companies
55:33 and we discussed this um
55:36 how looks uh
55:37 like
55:38 what looks like the data science world
55:42 from the women's perspective
55:44 and um
55:46 the problem is that many women
55:49 are scared
55:50 about job interview and that's why
55:53 sometimes i don't have choice
55:56 yeah
55:58 but i think that more and more women
56:01 want to be a data scientist and want to
56:04 be data analysts so generally work with
56:07 data and
56:08 it's a good
56:11 situation that
56:13 i see that many
56:15 girls
56:16 and many women
56:18 like
56:20 work with computer
56:21 like work technical
56:24 and
56:26 they have
56:27 not not such a
56:29 big fail
56:33 to do it
56:35 yeah
56:36 and
56:37 what we can do
56:38 we can do we can talk
56:41 we can uh
56:42 spread aware
56:44 that awareness that
56:46 it's not so hard okay this general is
56:49 her job but uh
56:51 that
56:52 if you are a girl or if you are a man
56:55 this doesn't matter
56:56 it depends on your personality
56:58 and your skills
57:00 and everybody has
57:03 some advantages and disadvantages it
57:07 doesn't depend on the
57:08 gender
57:10 until yeah you mentioned that women
57:13 are scared of job interviews
57:16 maybe you as a manager can give them
57:18 some advice like how can they be
57:21 less gay if it's possible um
57:25 how to build a sky um
57:28 for me scared yes
57:29 yeah
57:30 um for me
57:32 this was always very helpful
57:35 uh
57:37 that i
57:39 talked with other people
57:41 with my friends or my family and they
57:44 encouraged me and they say okay
57:46 everything is good don't worry this is
57:48 not
57:49 i don't know this is not the last chance
57:51 or something like that
57:53 don't be afraid if not this job the
57:55 other one
57:56 and in this moment
57:57 the level the stress is uh lower
58:01 and the other thing is also
58:04 that everybody
58:06 especially women should be prepared for
58:09 different questions
58:11 and
58:12 say that
58:14 okay i can do it
58:16 i can do it and maybe i'm not
58:19 i don't
58:20 know all
58:23 requirements 100 but 80 70 requirements
58:27 are good enough
58:29 and
58:30 because
58:31 i see that math doesn't have i don't
58:34 have problems with that with this and
58:36 that they know
58:38 uh only 70 requirements from the job
58:41 offers
58:42 for women is a problem and this is i
58:44 think this is the most important thing
58:46 okay maybe i'm
58:48 don't uh suit uh for 100
58:51 i but i'm sued for
58:54 70. okay i could try
58:57 maybe not this chance maybe the other
58:59 one yeah and uh don't give up
59:03 yeah thanks
59:04 how can people find you
59:06 uh i think the best uh solution is
59:09 linkedin
59:10 uh
59:11 barbara kovyak uh yeah i think this is
59:14 the social media social media which i
59:17 use
59:18 the most
59:19 yeah
59:20 um yeah i think i also what i usually
59:24 ask even before how can people find you
59:26 if you have any
59:28 advice for anyone who is listening or
59:30 watching this
59:32 uh any advice
59:36 okay so advice
59:39 okay so if you are here and you are
59:42 looking
59:44 for which
59:45 in which direction you should go in your
59:47 with your career
59:49 uh you should ask yourself what gives
59:52 you the most satisfaction
59:54 and if you have problem with this
59:57 you should ask your friends or your
59:59 colleagues and you should find a mentor
1:00:02 i think it's it's easier if you find a
1:00:05 mentor
1:00:06 and you could
1:00:08 talk with him or her
1:00:10 and ask
1:00:13 he's all her about everything and
1:00:16 so
1:00:18 talking with people and networking
1:00:20 yeah thanks uh thanks
1:00:23 yeah i hope
1:00:24 many questions didn't take you off
1:00:26 guards they they're fun i i think you
1:00:30 enjoyed them as well yeah yeah
1:00:32 thanks a lot thanks for joining us
1:00:34 thanks for sharing your experience
1:00:36 thanks for telling your uh sharing your
1:00:39 stories uh with us and thanks everyone
1:00:41 for asking questions we got quite a few
1:00:43 questions that is there are still six
1:00:45 questions that we didn't cover so
1:00:47 apologies for that
1:00:49 yeah and uh i think that's it we should
1:00:51 be wrapping up and uh thanks barbara and
1:00:54 thank you thank you for your invitation
