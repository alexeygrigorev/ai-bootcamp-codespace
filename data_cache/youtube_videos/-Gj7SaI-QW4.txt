0:00 everyone Welcome to our event this event
0:02 is brought to you by datadox club which
0:04 is a community of people who love data
0:05 we have weekly events and today is one
0:07 of such events if you want to find out
0:09 more about the events we have there is a

0:23 today and we have a very cool slack
0:26 Community where you can hang out with
0:27 other data enthusiasts and one of the
0:31 things we have in slack is an amazing
0:33 initiative Adonis is one of those who
0:37 organize a lot of things there called
0:39 project of the week and we're just
0:41 finishing wrapping up
0:43 a week about learning rust so check it
0:46 out it's an amazing Community project of
0:48 the week is really a cool thing if you
0:50 don't know about that there is a channel
0:51 called project of the week

1:23 yeah where it is
1:26 and I guess we can start if you're ready
1:29 yep
1:30 okay
1:31 this week we'll talk about
1:33 freelancing and working at a startup
1:36 that we have special guests today Adonis
1:38 Adonis is a freelance data scientist who
1:40 is currently working at animatrix which
1:43 is a startup that is focusing on
1:45 providing software for Nana product
1:48 inspection that sounds really cool in
1:50 addition he recently joined a freelance
1:53 platform called upwork where he offers a
1:56 range of data solutions to clients
1:58 so welcome to the show
2:01 hi nice thank you for the intention and
2:04 nice to be here
2:05 yeah and what I did not have in the
2:09 script but Adonis actually is a very
2:12 very active member of data talks Club
2:13 Community and it's a real pleasure for
2:15 me to have him here today so thanks for
2:18 joining us today
2:21 and yeah so the questions for today's
2:23 interview are as always prepared by
2:25 Johanna buyer thanks a lot Johanna for
2:27 your help
2:28 and before we go into our main topic of
2:31 freelancing and working at the startup
2:33 let's start with your background can you
2:36 tell us about your journey so far
2:38 yeah so yeah I'll start with my bachelor
2:42 um I studied Applied Mathematics in
2:45 physics that's my main degree actually I
2:47 also focused on the on the physics uh
2:50 Direction
2:52 so I graduated as a physicist and then I
2:55 continued to do a master in Greece again
2:58 master and Barcelona in Greece uh that
3:02 was on nano technology
3:05 and there uh while I was doing my theses
3:08 I started working uh that was like
3:11 around 2017 I started working with data
3:15 science like it was because of my thesis
3:17 and after that I went to the Netherlands
3:21 to join a program that was that is
3:24 called a professional doctorate in
3:25 engineering
3:27 and uh there uh yeah you work for the
3:30 University and then the university sends
3:32 you do projects with companies around
3:34 Netherlands so you do those projects you
3:37 get exposure to Industry and also you
3:41 getting modules and trainings from the
3:44 University so it's like a combination
3:47 your education
3:49 yeah yeah so it's education and when
3:52 working with Center so it's the first
3:53 year you work as a kind of consultant
3:56 for a company doing small projects like
4:00 four month three months and then the
4:02 second year you they send you and do
4:03 like a one year contract with a company
4:07 um if you work there you provide Your
4:08 solution that is their problem and also
4:10 you get the training or kind of whatever
4:12 you need a specialist from the
4:14 University
4:15 so after that
4:17 I joined I became like a freelancer in
4:21 Greece I came back to Greece became a
4:22 freelancer and uh yeah my first job was
4:26 actually the reason I mostly agenda
4:29 getting back to Greece was for the
4:30 startup called nanometrices
4:32 uh where uh yeah as you told yeah what
4:36 we do is like rebuilding um software for
4:39 companies who are building Nano products
4:41 we help them inspect those because there
4:43 is a lot of complexity there and if
4:45 somebody doesn't want to invest their
4:47 money all the time or a team on uh
4:50 finding these metrics uh that uh
4:56 are characterizing uh Nano product
4:59 structure it's very complicated and yeah
5:02 if somebody doesn't want to do that we
5:04 offer them our software which can lift
5:07 this kind of further north
5:09 and uh yeah after while I was doing that
5:12 I because I was technically a freelancer
5:14 in Greece I was I joined the upwork uh
5:17 the platform which for Freelancers and I
5:20 was providing their solutions for muscle
5:21 learning data science
5:23 so that's happening right now
5:26 that's a cool Journey so what are those
5:29 Nana products like are there
5:31 like is it related to electronics like
5:33 uh phones and stuff yeah so actually
5:37 yeah one of the Nano products or clients
5:40 that we have
5:42 um has uh they're building services and
5:46 the nanoscale that you cannot see with
5:47 your eyes you need a special machine to
5:50 see them
5:51 electrons not light
5:54 um and these surfaces are the base for
5:58 the chips that we're using our phones on
6:00 our laptop
6:03 um also apart from that there are uh
6:06 some uh ages you know that we have for
6:09 erasers
6:11 so even the edges of the razors have to
6:13 be have to have a very specific
6:17 how to have a roughness a specific
6:19 roughness on there so so they can be
6:22 effective and uh you know at the hair
6:24 only uh and then there are non-particles
6:27 we can be on the uh creams that we put
6:30 in our face so they have to have
6:31 specific sizes
6:33 so there's a big variety
6:35 of nanoproduction it's keep growing
6:38 so I only knew about the the chips part
6:42 uh but I had no idea about razors and
6:45 these nanoparticles that's pretty
6:47 interesting they never realized that
6:49 razors are such a complex thing yeah
6:52 okay we can just uh
6:54 you know sharp thing that he used to
6:57 compare yeah it was a very like
7:00 complicated and a lot of science behind
7:03 it
7:04 I know that Philips
7:07 um like the the razor I use is a big
7:11 company in the Netherlands is it like
7:13 did you did you get any exposure to
7:16 these things that Philips did you work
7:17 at Phillips in any way
7:20 not in physics and not the Phillips
7:23 other people did uh but uh
7:26 uh yeah I had another other companies
7:29 like HTML which is also like a uh was an
7:33 old spin spin-off or spin out I think
7:35 from Phillips but uh there were people
7:37 who did projects with Phillips
7:40 as I heard about programs like the one
7:42 you had and he usually like Philips
7:45 invests a lot of money thanks I think
7:48 one of the universities did you studied
7:50 the Eindhoven University yeah yeah so
7:54 actually uh it it is in a from Eindhoven
7:58 and there's also a joint program from
8:00 delft and
8:07 anyways so you finished your program you
8:11 came back to Greece and you decided to
8:13 work at a startup
8:15 so how did it happen why startup why not
8:17 join a corporation
8:19 yeah so
8:22 yeah I I had an opportunity to either
8:24 work for a corporation uh kind of
8:27 recuperation was I think open was the
8:29 snc maybe you know it luck uh yeah there
8:33 was uh I had the opportunity either to
8:36 work there or to work on the startup I
8:39 had like both offers around the same
8:41 time
8:43 so
8:45 the things that
8:47 I was yeah I had like after I graduate
8:51 after I graduated I finished the program
8:53 I had a lot of time and I was doing uh
8:57 the interviews and I had you know
8:58 rejections of the all the process and
9:02 then at the same time I had those two
9:03 workers so I was thinking my head okay
9:05 what I want like I had to stop and think
9:07 like uh
9:10 for many days and uh
9:13 yeah I decided that uh I would like to
9:16 try I always admire you know the the
9:19 journey like entrepreneurship journey
9:20 and creating something Innovative and uh
9:24 push it in the market and see okay how
9:26 it goes getting feedback all this kind
9:28 of
9:29 um
9:31 parts of you know the startup and they
9:33 always admired you know started stories
9:35 so I said okay I'm gonna do it now and
9:38 if something doesn't go well or maybe I
9:40 have other opportunities
9:42 to to go to a corporation oh and also by
9:45 the way yeah the startup was doing what
9:48 I was doing in the master and I would do
9:50 something in data science which I don't
9:51 think would be very
9:53 easy
9:54 yeah
9:55 so in your Masters you were doing some
9:58 Nano product stuff already
10:00 yeah
10:02 okay so it was uh quite related so you
10:05 were interested in this in this Nano
10:07 products you were interested in data
10:09 science and it was the uh kind of the
10:12 best thing like
10:14 two together
10:16 yeah yeah yeah
10:18 okay that's pretty interesting and when
10:20 you were deciding to be in startup and
10:23 Corporation I think probably there were
10:26 also some good side good things about
10:29 you know joining the corporation right
10:31 did you do some sort of I don't know
10:34 like for example when I need to make a
10:36 decision sometimes what I do is I list
10:37 pros and cons and then I see okay like
10:40 there are more prompts Pros here than
10:42 console then this is
10:44 like the decision they take did you do
10:46 something like this when deciding
10:48 exactly I did exactly uh like that and I
10:52 also was trying I I cut down all the I
10:55 was not telling anyone about this so I
10:58 cut off everyone's you know kind of
11:00 opinion that might affect you there was
11:02 me and myself let's say and I was yeah
11:04 trying to balance this uh the pros and
11:08 cons you definitely get some pros from
11:11 working on a corporation and you know
11:13 some cones and uh yeah I said let's try
11:17 the startup Direction
11:20 um I I thought they would give me some
11:22 more value maybe in the future I will
11:24 you know go back to the corporate
11:27 environment to get something there
11:29 or maybe startup becomes a preparation
11:32 oh yeah that's uh also a good not good
11:36 as well
11:38 yeah and like do you remember what what
11:41 were this pros and console for pros
11:43 working for a startup I think you
11:45 mentioned like you know creating
11:46 something Innovative and then like other
11:49 things
11:50 do you remember what were the
11:52 you know other things you put in when
11:55 decided
11:56 yeah
11:57 um
11:59 I think with a with a corporate
12:02 environment okay they're always
12:03 exceptions okay but uh
12:06 your kind of more Focus to your job that
12:10 is in your description
12:12 um
12:13 but in in a startup you might take other
12:16 positions as well because you're not so
12:18 many people so you have to yeah you have
12:21 to maybe talk to clients or you have to
12:24 do The Branding uh maybe you have to
12:27 make a video about your company that
12:29 okay
12:30 like so many things that the there might
12:33 be uh somebody else's job in a corporate
12:36 uh incorporate environment so and I
12:40 think that for some person could be can
12:44 put it in the console put it on the uh
12:46 on the pros you know depending on what
12:49 they like to do and for you was it the
12:52 pro or cons I think it for me was a kind
12:55 of Pros yeah I wanted to have the
12:57 ability to of course to go a bit to the
13:00 also the business so part of it or other
13:03 aspects of it to control it to control
13:05 them
13:07 and they actually need to record videos
13:09 now
13:12 um no I hadn't uh not just but I built a
13:14 website
13:17 it's cool
13:18 some people in the in my company have
13:22 made videos like in the recorded them
13:25 and post them you know for branding
13:28 um
13:29 yeah but I think also a one pro I could
13:33 definitely think and I want that
13:37 in the startup is like you you are more
13:40 organized by
13:42 kind of nature like you have to be
13:45 organized more in
13:48 in the AI corporate environment in a
13:51 startup you have yourself to do that
13:55 maybe it has to do a bit with
13:57 accountability as well so yeah you're
14:01 yourself you're accountable while in the
14:03 in the company it's more easy to be
14:06 somebody else so you had
14:08 deadlines by your manager or your team
14:11 but with a startups you put in your
14:14 deadlines or you maybe yeah your clients
14:16 depends
14:18 so yeah that's that would be as well
14:20 something different
14:22 how large is the company where you work
14:25 uh
14:28 how large is the company where you work
14:29 we are um for active people yeah for
14:34 four okay
14:37 that's a pretty small startup
14:39 yeah I don't know yeah I see I think
14:43 startups with two people so like yeah
14:46 startups with one two one people right
14:49 yeah yeah that's true yeah in
14:52 accelerator that we have
14:54 there were some that uh it was just one
14:57 person
14:57 like building two things I was like okay
15:01 yeah so four people and then if you're
15:04 one of these four you have to do pretty
15:05 much everything right so yeah yeah yeah
15:08 for me it was uh now we were in an
15:11 accelerator and uh was getting a lot of
15:13 business uh we were Christian of
15:16 business argument let's say uh because
15:18 we were coming actually from academic
15:20 mindset the the the
15:23 nanomaticists started that is the
15:26 spin-off uh from a research center in
15:28 Greece so yeah I myself had to get this
15:33 kind of knowledge a lot and Country Door
15:37 yeah
15:38 to to the company
15:41 yeah what did you since you joined what
15:44 kind of new skills have you learned
15:46 working at a startup
15:49 and yeah
15:51 so I think
15:54 the communication how to be better
15:59 communicating with the team
16:03 um because I was kind of not exactly the
16:07 only data scientist
16:08 when I was building something I had to
16:11 translate it
16:13 with not so many complicated technical
16:17 uh you know words to other people
16:21 um also maybe to some clients or
16:24 managers or CEOs and other clients so
16:27 communication skills as well definitely
16:29 it was yeah and this was just an example
16:33 another thing for me was business
16:35 knowledge
16:36 I learned I'm still learning I have a a
16:41 lot a lot more to go
16:44 um
16:45 and I think
16:48 yeah because again I was accountable for
16:52 myself and for the client I had to
16:54 increase
16:56 more of my quality of uh you know my
17:00 product or my
17:02 uh my code
17:05 still is not on the level that I want
17:08 but yeah I'm doing and a lot of learning
17:11 you know you have to be able to learn
17:15 things on your own
17:18 um
17:19 yeah and being kind of yeah the other
17:22 thing that was was talking to you or
17:25 yeah I was talking about like I wasn't
17:27 the blog about being lean that's uh that
17:30 was a big thing for me uh like there
17:33 they're kind of the lean way to work
17:35 what is uh what is a lean way to work
17:39 yeah so
17:41 um
17:42 yeah it comes from the fact that we
17:44 don't uh
17:46 uh we cannot make very accurate
17:49 predictions of something that will be
17:52 able to publish or how it will go so we
17:55 built the product and that was that
17:58 product was built on assumptions
18:00 okay
18:01 so uh okay if it's the physics and or
18:06 maybe I should send something to space I
18:08 know it's very complicated but there the
18:10 rules are
18:11 can be predictable because okay there
18:14 are masses and you can't rewrite some
18:17 things uh in the note and predict where
18:20 the next second maybe the specific goal
18:23 but uh okay of course it's complicated
18:27 at some other parts but yeah but when
18:30 you launch a product or even you launch
18:31 a new model uh it's um you have to uh
18:36 you you do this on based on assumptions
18:38 and you have to test them that's the
18:40 thing you have to test them as soon as
18:41 possible and from the test that you get
18:43 you get a feedback right see this this
18:47 thing works this thing didn't work I
18:49 made a prediction that um
18:52 my side who sells cars uh I'm selling
18:56 more I'm trying to push more red cars to
18:58 sell them because I think people like
19:00 red
19:01 cars more I have to test this this is my
19:05 best idea right now like my Innovative
19:07 idea I have to test it I tried it out
19:08 yeah it didn't work I saw um yeah I have
19:12 to Pivot you know try to do something
19:13 different so
19:16 this the leanway is based on like this
19:19 circle but called the build you build
19:21 something you measure it
19:23 and then you learn from it and then you
19:25 do build again and you do this looks
19:27 trying to because again
19:30 you cannot know you cannot predict
19:32 everything
19:35 so there is an idea you think that this
19:38 idea is going to work you need to find a
19:40 way to test this idea right and then you
19:42 need to have a way to measure this idea
19:45 like do people really buy
19:48 more cars if we have more red cars
19:50 something like that right and then you
19:52 say okay I can give people buy more or
19:53 like nothing changes right and then this
19:56 gives you some idea that you can
19:58 you know I to change your assumptions or
20:02 maybe develop them
20:03 right yeah development further I don't
20:07 know yeah yeah and that can go with uh
20:10 you know that was a startup example but
20:12 it goes definitely well with the machine
20:15 learning or data data machine learning
20:20 process sorry or a data product
20:23 so it seems like it's something that
20:26 will work in other environments too not
20:29 just the stuff okay like a corporation
20:32 too
20:34 yeah well I think uh in the end that uh
20:38 that's something uh that they do and
20:42 yeah maybe even actually the the book
20:44 that I was reading about this The Lean
20:47 Startup was called the book I was saying
20:49 in the beginning that it's not only for
20:51 startups don't uh yeah uh it's for
20:55 everyone like for for companies for uh
20:58 yeah
20:59 right for I mean like yeah maybe life
21:02 like uh
21:04 in in machine learning you know you make
21:07 assumption about when you publish a
21:09 model how would it go based on the
21:11 training and data set that you're having
21:13 the testing but then when you publish it
21:16 uh things might change and the one
21:19 aspect that people think right now
21:21 discuss a lot and you have it in the
21:23 mlops
21:25 course is the monitoring right and there
21:29 are things drift like you have data
21:32 drift or concept drift
21:35 um and uh
21:36 yeah I mean like you have to monitor
21:39 them and see whether your model or the
21:42 assumptions change I mean like tools
21:44 like I think you have the evidently
21:47 um yeah definitely I can it would be
21:50 useful to to have them
21:53 and for those who do not know Adonis now
21:56 is talking about the ml Ops course the
21:59 free course that started
22:01 last week so we are still on module one
22:05 and by the time the recording is out we
22:07 will probably be on module like 3 PB but
22:11 yeah you can check it out I think there
22:13 should be a link in the description to
22:15 this video too
22:16 and maybe I actually wanted to talk to
22:20 you about that a little bit later
22:22 but before starting the stream I asked
22:26 you when you joined data talks Club so
22:28 maybe you can tell us a bit more about
22:29 that because you're a really active
22:31 member of our community and it's a very
22:34 interesting to hear your story like how
22:36 did it happen that you joined our
22:38 community
22:40 all right yeah so I had a friend who's
22:43 also was in the program in Antelope
22:45 Leonard and uh yeah I was we were
22:48 talking about courses it's like
22:50 discussing okay I wanna I was telling
22:52 him hey I want to check out uh I had
22:54 more courses because I think I'm weak on
22:56 some topics and he said okay I know like
23:00 Alexei or data talks lab is this you can
23:03 check it out they have the back then was
23:05 I think December he was telling me about
23:07 that you had the data engineering of
23:10 course I was like okay yeah I will check
23:12 it out and I was a bit late joint so I
23:15 did enjoy the the engineering course
23:17 that you had I think it was maybe the
23:20 first the engineering that you what you
23:22 had there and
23:24 um I was I didn't know you know about
23:26 the concept of the slack or the talks
23:30 that you had so I wasn't sure what it is
23:32 uh um and I was as the time was passing
23:36 the month were passing I was seeing the
23:38 maybe the talks so I was might taking
23:40 some of the talks that you had the
23:42 interviews you know and then I was
23:44 taking more the slug
23:45 so
23:48 I slowly kind of understood what was
23:52 happening in slack and the whole
23:54 community so I said okay I'll join the
23:57 Emma lost when it was a chance I really
23:59 liked it I definitely liked the fact
24:02 that people were posting the questions
24:04 or talking about envelopes like it was
24:08 something I realized that I didn't have
24:11 um first okay in my startup you know I
24:13 was
24:14 the scientists alone there kind of
24:18 um and uh it was fascinating to see you
24:21 know people from around the world
24:22 talking about you know data and
24:24 something new that was happening
24:27 and also learn you know from the
24:30 learn something new
24:31 and uh yeah after that there was uh I
24:36 wanted to be you know more active as so
24:38 that I liked apart from yeah being in
24:41 the community maybe I could do something
24:43 smaller my own like you you suggested
24:47 the the project of the week so yeah
24:51 yeah that's really cool to have you here
24:53 and it's a nice to hear your story so
24:56 you try to do data engineering course
24:58 then like you've learned like it was a
25:02 bit late I guess or you will yeah you
25:05 did the envelopes one right yeah that
25:07 was the first one yeah
25:09 do you remember what your project was
25:10 about
25:12 yeah my
25:14 I chose like a semiconductor
25:17 uh project I don't remember I was I was
25:20 predicting right now yeah uh but I was
25:22 there was a lot of features and I was
25:24 trying to I was in machine learning
25:26 model I was I think predicting as the
25:28 fault of uh if uh the chip is gonna fail
25:32 or not I'm not not sure but uh
25:36 uh yeah I had the opportunity to
25:40 um yeah do usml flow
25:44 um I would say I had I had I didn't in
25:47 the past
25:49 um check the check out the you know
25:51 grafana and Luis
25:53 uh evidently Ai and also use a yeah uh
25:59 prefect perfect it was was a very nice
26:02 alternative for me personally to
26:05 workflow
26:07 I would like for me it was for the
26:09 things I wanted to build was much easier
26:11 so
26:12 yeah I I had the opportunity you know to
26:15 use them all uh kind of as you did in
26:19 the
26:20 in the course but uh yeah all of them
26:23 together for a course it was a big
26:25 learning the the you're having a project
26:26 definitely it was the best thing in the
26:29 end for uh
26:31 you know you know getting the knowledge
26:34 installed in your head
26:37 okay do you have any suggestions for the
26:39 students who just start the summer Labs
26:41 course
26:43 yeah
26:44 um I think uh it's first to
26:49 um to yeah check for sure the those for
26:53 sure the
26:54 exercises in the end
26:56 you can watch a video and then you can
26:58 forget after that what they did if you
27:00 don't practice it yourself for me it
27:03 happens all the time I think I know it
27:04 but it's different the knowledge apart
27:06 from the skills apart like those things
27:08 are different
27:13 I know everybody might be very busy but
27:18 uh
27:19 if they have patience and to slowly
27:21 progress every day or whenever they have
27:23 time they for sure can make it and
27:25 people are very
27:28 um yeah flexible on on the deadlines so
27:31 you were flexible I was feeling myself
27:33 sometimes I was very pressured on the
27:35 deadline but okay you said okay let's
27:37 extend it one week I don't know maybe I
27:40 should say that yeah
27:44 um and for sure the final final project
27:47 that again as I said before was the the
27:50 best thing
27:51 I don't know yeah another another thing
27:53 uh which I didn't mention that the
27:55 community helped me was that you were
27:57 mentioning a lot about uh posting your
28:00 progress in public or making a post I I
28:04 myself I couldn't
28:06 post every
28:07 every day but uh I was thinking of the
28:10 people doing which looked nice but I
28:12 posted you know my my final one and uh I
28:17 had a lot of requests people sending me
28:19 messages to discuss about it so I really
28:22 like that as well you know like people
28:23 haven't had questions about my project
28:26 in the yeah so it was also very
28:29 rewarding as well that was pretty cool
28:32 and I know that in the course you used
28:34 evidently and then I saw you in the
28:37 evidently community and I think he also
28:39 contributed to the two like how did it
28:42 happen can you tell us about that
28:44 yeah so I think it was
28:46 um I saw the evidently I like the two
28:49 and then they announced the hack
28:53 Oktoberfest uh for in October
28:57 and
28:58 um
28:59 uh they they they they announced it or
29:03 the organization behind it and evidently
29:05 itself had some uh issues posted that
29:09 you could uh touch solve them and you do
29:12 a pull request and yeah I like the tool
29:15 like the the whole aspect of it it
29:19 fitted you know as I said before in my
29:22 uh
29:27 um aspect of the yeah of the startup and
29:31 uh yeah I said okay well let's let's try
29:33 it out I wasn't sure I could
29:37 do something useful but yeah this is
29:39 something I'm trying to follow it but I
29:42 again um it's again I like I like the
29:45 community there very much the people
29:47 definitely and I'm learning a lot from
29:49 there as well
29:51 are you still contributing
29:53 I try to yeah yeah that is like a small
29:55 contribution on a notebook like a like a
29:59 how-to you know like recently not
30:02 like as a tutorial mostly I'm trying
30:05 more to I don't have a lot of time but
30:09 uh when I have like I'll try to put it
30:11 there
30:12 yeah well speaking of having not so much
30:15 time well I know you work at a startup
30:17 you also take a very active part in our
30:20 community then you also contribute to
30:23 open source like evidently and he also
30:25 freelance so take tell us about that
30:27 part like how how did you start
30:29 freelancing and what do you do now
30:31 as a freelancer yeah so I
30:36 um yeah I was doing the I was working on
30:38 a startup and I wanted to expose myself
30:42 more on data science and Building Things
30:45 apart from Gaining the knowledge I want
30:47 also some actual
30:49 uh uh you know clients on myself for the
30:53 data science part just for me to grow
30:55 and you know some extra income if I can
30:59 and I found this platform called upwork
31:03 where
31:05 it's a platform that allows Freelancers
31:09 apart from it could be data scientists
31:11 machine learning Engineers but it could
31:12 be some web designer so it's not only
31:15 for data
31:16 uh reasons uh yeah the platform offers
31:19 them a sport to
31:23 yeah the refrigerant spot also offers
31:25 the same spot for clients so plants post
31:28 their their job and clients see those
31:31 jobs and they apply all together and see
31:34 yeah the client says okay I won't
31:37 I like you let's do an interview okay
31:40 you're fitted let's start the project
31:42 the project could be fixed price or
31:45 hourly
31:46 there's a lot of competition but it's a
31:48 very nice
31:50 platform yeah
31:52 what kind of projects are there usually
31:54 like are they long projects short
31:55 projects all all kinds it could be
32:01 um I have a niche I check out my
32:03 dissertation
32:05 uh like for two hours or something and
32:09 there could be
32:12 um like a six-month project on building
32:16 um
32:18 like now there I see a lot of llms like
32:22 uh you know yeah
32:24 LGBT related things what kind of
32:27 projects do you usually go after
32:29 machine learning data science yeah
32:32 analytics those things
32:36 yeah those those three those three and
32:38 there are a lot of a lot of those and
32:41 very diverse like could be from the
32:43 healthcare I had the one the big one
32:45 from there
32:46 and it kind of specs mining it was
32:49 and uh yeah there was one for again to
32:53 build a model like a
32:56 segmentation model I had also won
32:59 recently
33:02 so like from what I hear it's more like
33:06 short-term projects maybe for a week or
33:09 a month something like that actually the
33:11 yeah the health their Health Care
33:13 Project was uh four or three months
33:18 um and yeah the the segmentation that I
33:22 did was uh three weeks I had one also
33:26 give like a it was very short but it
33:28 depends like there's I myself couldn't
33:31 join because I had the starter green
33:33 Journey very very long long one because
33:37 I was doing shorter projects like you
33:39 can choose to to have like to put more
33:43 more than 40 hours per week you know
33:46 like it's you can filter out even the
33:48 jobs
33:49 uh but there are long-term I just have
33:52 to help them to choose a certain because
33:54 of my the times I can put it
33:58 and
33:59 Yeah you mentioned that there is a lot
34:01 of competition and I imagine that
34:02 especially if you're just getting
34:04 started at a platform like upwork or
34:07 fever or you know there are multiple
34:09 there are a few a few of them
34:11 like how do you actually get this first
34:14 client with all this competition with
34:16 all the other Freelancers on this
34:18 platform yeah that's a very good
34:21 question
34:22 um
34:24 you have to again have patience that's a
34:27 definitely the biggest advice and
34:30 persistence so
34:33 um you build you do by step by step
34:35 first you build like a basic resume or
34:39 or the portfolio upwork helps you
34:42 artwork wants you to get clients because
34:46 even from the business related listen
34:47 reasons they get some money out of all
34:51 this
34:51 so you definitely have the support
34:54 kind of from the from the side
34:58 um I myself I I had to watch a lot of
35:01 you know YouTube videos like people who
35:04 are there and had the same or same spot
35:06 as me and as the person yeah you ask you
35:08 asked
35:10 um so I think the first thing is to
35:12 build a basic portfolio try some uh do
35:15 some
35:16 uh
35:18 answer some
35:21 can find the word yeah uh clients judge
35:24 you know go to try to take them post as
35:29 as beautiful as you can why you want the
35:31 job or what you can do about it if they
35:34 reject you it's fine try to get to learn
35:36 from it why why it happened
35:38 and uh yeah kind of improve step by step
35:42 and for me it helped a lot again this to
35:45 have this process like I didn't get a
35:47 job any in the beginning any job then I
35:50 found out okay I should write a better
35:52 message to them trying to explain
35:53 exactly what I can do for them and then
35:56 I built like I was sending them apart
35:59 from my message they they can you can
36:01 present attachment okay I didn't use
36:03 that attachment okay I built a
36:05 PowerPoint
36:06 I was all the process that I've done
36:08 myself
36:10 um not to want to have to do with a
36:12 natural client like I I had actually the
36:14 mlops project that I did
36:17 uh from foreign
36:21 and uh I had it attached in my message
36:24 so in the end
36:27 um and by proving again every maybe day
36:30 every week your
36:31 um your profile you have you get higher
36:34 chances you might not get get the best
36:37 client in the beginning but if you get a
36:39 small job
36:40 you get might get five stars you know
36:42 okay you didn't get much fun but uh you
36:45 get the five stars then you get another
36:46 five stars maybe then you can you know
36:48 climb more and more so it's a
36:54 you have to put your time to invest and
36:57 have patience but it's again I think
36:59 could be rewarding
37:00 from what I heard it looks like the
37:02 course helped you actually get inclined
37:05 yeah yeah it helped it helped okay good
37:09 happy to hear that so you said that
37:13 um you were constantly improving and
37:15 trying to figure out why rejections
37:17 happened
37:18 so why do you think rejections actually
37:20 happen because your profile wasn't
37:22 complete because the clients were unsure
37:24 that you can do the job or what was the
37:26 reason
37:27 yeah
37:28 yeah so
37:30 some
37:33 uh most of the yeah somebody else if
37:36 somebody else gets a job yeah maybe
37:39 um another person had the written a
37:42 better
37:44 um I cannot sign again this kind of the
37:46 word for that
37:49 sorry cover letter portfolio yeah the
37:51 cover letter exactly it's like yeah it
37:53 may be written and cover letter or had
37:55 more fitted job uh
37:59 yeah our skills about that or had more
38:02 experience or maybe they they were less
38:06 money so I think it depends I think it
38:09 always helps maybe that's maybe
38:11 something I didn't say before to have a
38:13 specific skill
38:15 maybe like three years or sorry um one
38:19 year ago seeing a lot of chatbots people
38:21 if so if you had a very good experience
38:23 on building chatbots you can focus only
38:26 on that and then you get some clients
38:28 there that helps a lot I wasn't kind of
38:30 that person
38:32 uh so for me yeah I you don't get
38:36 exactly the the feedback you have to ask
38:38 or it's from clients if you don't get an
38:41 answer you can again make assumptions
38:42 but I was saying always this YouTube
38:45 videos or the instructions or the
38:47 advices they are was giving and I I was
38:50 seeing myself
38:52 yeah I was not writing a good uh cover
38:54 letter yeah I I maybe asked for two
38:58 months so yeah I have to check I have to
39:00 put more skills for my
39:02 resume
39:03 so yeah
39:06 was it worth it like it looks like you
39:09 went through a lot of troubles to
39:10 actually start getting clients like do
39:12 you enjoy it
39:14 yeah yeah so it wasn't that the
39:18 I was doing only that so
39:22 again for me it was a learning
39:24 experience from the beginning so I
39:26 enjoyed it and also like you get the
39:32 um some kind of angry not exactly angry
39:35 that's okay why I'm not getting where I
39:37 want like what I'm missing so
39:39 it's kind of uh building uh building up
39:43 until you get a success so kinda you get
39:47 a push to be to develop better to
39:49 develop yourself better yeah yeah
39:52 okay cool
39:55 um so now in addition to your uh
39:58 to work at the startup you have a few
40:01 extra gigs that you do at upwork right
40:05 yeah yeah yeah right uh you just
40:07 finished one recently with uh with the
40:10 one that the segmentation
40:12 that I was talking about uh yeah but now
40:15 I like I don't have any
40:17 I've heard that one of the problems with
40:19 upwork and that are similar platforms is
40:22 that there are a lot of people who work
40:25 for very little money
40:27 and then you kind of have to compete
40:30 with them how did you solve this problem
40:31 like how do you do you come up how do
40:33 you come up with the price for your
40:35 offers for your projects
40:38 yeah
40:40 um I'm not able to answer this exactly
40:44 this is indeed an issue
40:46 um I myself have put it a
40:49 like an hourly you know 43 dollars per
40:53 hour and
40:55 um I'm trying to follow that as much as
40:58 I can depending on the project if the
41:00 project is not going to take a lot of
41:02 time for me I might
41:04 and it's not very complicated I might
41:06 lower it
41:08 um if it's a good big Corporation I will
41:10 definitely put it like that so again it
41:13 sorry depends on the client secondly
41:15 secondly depends on
41:18 again me valuing my time so I I have my
41:22 kind of income from the startup
41:24 and uh I'm okay so I have a kind of a
41:28 basic salary so again the question is
41:30 this rest of the time that I have
41:33 how much I value it if I value it very
41:38 like a 10 dollars per hour for a project
41:42 that uh is not gonna offer me something
41:45 new like a new
41:47 skills then I'm not gonna accept if it's
41:51 10 hours then then dollars per hour
41:54 again the same but it's something that's
41:55 going to give me definitely nice skills
41:57 and I really like it I might do it if it
42:00 is very good money I will uh yeah again
42:03 gonna do it so it depends on how how I
42:07 buy you my time
42:09 it's personal
42:11 so
42:14 um you are now at up work and you see a
42:18 nice project then you probably I don't
42:20 know apply to this project you send a
42:22 cover letter you sent the PowerPoint
42:24 presentation and then you come up with a
42:27 price depending on the type of the
42:29 client
42:30 and what what happens next
42:32 after apply like
42:34 yeah so that's a yeah indeed a very
42:37 interesting uh part of the process that
42:41 um
42:42 so after that you get you might have
42:45 already done an interview to get
42:47 accepted but then it starts another
42:48 process of okay starting with the
42:50 project
42:51 uh all the clients problem
42:55 um and there my personally saying that I
42:58 have to make sure that the tasks for
43:02 getting
43:04 in the final solution or the Milestone
43:08 at least that has been decided is clicks
43:10 are clear
43:11 or as lesser clear as it can be
43:15 so I'm trying to I'm trying to talk with
43:18 a client and again it depending on the
43:20 client like if it's a big Corporation
43:21 it's more easy to do that it's a it's an
43:23 only person alone it's more difficult
43:25 but uh after the the interview the first
43:30 interview or the you have getting
43:32 accepted you have to
43:34 um maybe do a kind of an inspection or
43:36 call we can call sometimes data
43:39 inspection and see okay what do they
43:40 have uh is it true what they had there
43:43 was they were saying is indeed the data
43:46 that they were saying okay
43:48 um I see I I take some time and see okay
43:50 can I solve it
43:52 um in the way that they asked or do we
43:57 have to
43:58 uh tell them how I'm gonna I'm gonna
44:00 solve it so you do this kind of more
44:03 theoretical
44:04 and less practical parts and uh you both
44:08 agree you have to both agree with your
44:10 stakeholder or the other client and then
44:12 you start doing the actual task and
44:15 while you're doing again the tasks you
44:17 have to make some Milestones okay I did
44:19 that where we are do we like it let's
44:21 move on and so it's a another kind of
44:25 first
44:26 looks like similar to what we talked
44:28 about in the lean uh about this yeah
44:31 right
44:32 yeah yeah yeah it's philosophy it's
44:36 immense
44:37 so you just work in Milestones then you
44:41 see if the client is satisfied with what
44:43 you do and if they are you continue
44:45 working so then you get constant
44:47 feedback from them right
44:49 yeah yeah yeah
44:49 that's you always what you want to do
44:52 it's more I can say it more easy that I
44:55 can do it myself there are always some
44:58 things you know unpredictable but it's
45:00 okay
45:01 and uh yeah I I failed sometimes myself
45:05 like doing this kind of process and I
45:07 try to improve it every time
45:10 yeah
45:12 and two in order to work as a freelancer
45:15 you needed to register a company or how
45:17 does it work ah yeah yeah so
45:20 yeah you have to be
45:22 um
45:24 I tried to translate it in uh from grip
45:26 uh like
45:28 um
45:29 uh yeah you have to register as a
45:32 freelancer for your own uh country
45:37 so when you get that kind of income you
45:40 can say okay you have to put an invoice
45:42 and uh publish it I don't know kind of
45:46 thing the in the country and so they can
45:49 bring the taxes
45:52 um
45:52 so yeah you don't just you know start
45:56 go to upwork register and start early in
45:59 the money right so there is some yeah
46:01 yeah yeah you have to like okay maybe
46:05 maybe you can do it and never get the
46:08 money in your bank and put it always put
46:10 it you can stay always in the app on the
46:12 upwork I don't know if you want that
46:14 entire thread or so sorry
46:17 so if the money is in upwork then like
46:22 what are you going to do with this money
46:24 yeah I don't know I don't know what's
46:26 happening like you can actually put it
46:29 there until you I don't know
46:31 uh maybe maybe you can do it and then
46:34 start a company on your own to get them
46:37 in your bank first you try to get a few
46:39 clients and if this thing works out then
46:41 you go through the paperwork so you
46:44 don't have to but immediately off the
46:46 platform yeah maybe you or you can do
46:48 them in parallel because they're doing
46:50 the paperwork maybe take some time
46:52 depending on where you are
46:54 you know like uh you can take
46:57 some delays you know there is a public
47:01 sector things
47:03 so it's your work you have to wear
47:06 multiple hats so we talked about many
47:08 different things you need to like talk
47:10 to clients uh maybe even do videos and
47:13 all that kind of stuff while here as a
47:16 freelancer you you are more focused on
47:19 machine learning right
47:23 you still need to do some extra stuff
47:27 I think again the communication students
47:30 the the whole process that I described
47:33 made the if you had like a good soft
47:37 maybe skills but say it better it will
47:40 help you because as you might have a
47:42 person again you have to control the the
47:45 whole process with the client
47:47 and also present them what you did with
47:51 maybe you don't have to maybe a lot of
47:53 technical
47:56 um yeah so again this kind of skills are
47:59 very
48:00 uh very viable and and I think you can
48:04 again connect it with everything like
48:05 again business
48:07 you you are a business or your own there
48:09 and I was thinking about how value your
48:12 time and you have to decide that so you
48:14 maybe have to kind of get again the the
48:18 business knowledge for yourself
48:24 these are skills that you can learn them
48:26 along the way
48:28 and
48:29 yeah you can you can do some failures
48:32 and you can learn from them I think
48:35 again if somebody listens to this
48:37 podcast uh podcast and make a checklist
48:40 again it's not very easy to track with
48:43 all of these things unless you as you
48:45 you do them
48:47 you know so uh again if somebody wants
48:51 to I think you asked before it just
48:53 won't start just go for it and
48:57 it would be viable for sure
49:00 you get some good skills
49:02 thank you there's a question from
49:04 Anonymous I struggled to get freelance
49:07 work other than being consistent in the
49:09 search for freelance work do you have
49:11 any other suggestions
49:13 I think we discussed this partly so like
49:16 iterate improve your profile right that
49:19 was one of the things
49:21 um
49:21 is there anything else you would
49:23 recommend to the anonymous person
49:25 well I didn't I didn't answer the second
49:27 part like um
49:29 yeah so the question is I struggle to
49:31 get freelance work other than being
49:34 consistent in the search for freelance
49:36 work do you have any other suggestions
49:40 I can see
49:44 um um
49:46 I think it can be a good idea while you
49:51 are
49:53 see okay see what is valuable for the
49:56 client all right
49:59 um okay searching uh and and for you to
50:02 get a job so doing consistent and
50:04 persistent way of uh yeah doing a lot of
50:07 uh taking a lot of jobs it will help you
50:10 um the other thing which I said uh fix
50:13 your profile every day try to see where
50:16 you can improve like if you can improve
50:19 your profile every day by little in one
50:21 month you can have very good profile
50:24 um I think you can also while you're
50:26 doing that see where
50:28 um you want to focus your skills or
50:32 um whether you want to learn something
50:34 new and while you doing this search also
50:38 learn a skill or improve your skill
50:41 skill set that's also very valuable
50:46 and
50:49 yeah check for sure the YouTube videos
50:52 and tutorials from other people in the
50:54 network Community they they will help
50:56 you definitely
50:58 uh you can follow their advices and yeah
51:01 like while you're doing the skills maybe
51:02 you can build you know uh like I did a
51:06 project
51:07 from in the mlops
51:10 uh course and uh
51:12 put it on your GitHub
51:16 and then put it on your presentation you
51:19 know and attach to it when in your next
51:24 um cover letter
51:27 those things I can think right now
51:29 so we're struggling with getting upward
51:33 clients do our courses and do projects
51:35 in our courses right and then
51:39 yes hello project
51:42 cool thanks uh
51:44 yeah so maybe coming back to what he do
51:47 at Daily Talk slab this is something I
51:49 wanted to talk at the end well we
51:51 mentioned already you took part in our
51:54 courses
51:55 you also recently finished the date
51:57 engineering course right yeah
52:00 so did like it yeah I I liked it and
52:03 there were some skills that I wanted to
52:08 I really liked it
52:10 um
52:11 I didn't have an exposure a lot you know
52:14 to streaming and I wanted a lot of focus
52:17 on that in uh in this in this one
52:23 um
52:24 it's also yeah for the final project I I
52:28 use the Kafka Co fluent actually
52:32 and yeah I think
52:35 uh I would totally
52:38 recommend to it to anyone uh
52:41 this course I really liked you know the
52:44 the document that you had you had the
52:47 secret document with uh answers you know
52:51 questions that people had or uh and
52:54 frequently asked a question yeah
52:58 that saved a lot of a lot of time like
53:01 it was amazing how many times I had the
53:04 same issue
53:07 um and I think it's not easy easy to
53:08 make like a debt engineering of course
53:11 because a lot of technical little things
53:13 aspects or versions change as you go you
53:17 know
53:18 yeah but um
53:21 I yeah it was uh it was very valuable
53:25 thing to do
53:28 what your project was about you said he
53:30 mentioned it was streaming but what kind
53:32 of project it also sound like
53:35 semiconductor no no the um I wanted
53:38 actually to go to come to send you like
53:41 uh maybe to
53:43 we make something valuable
53:47 so I tried in the beginning to try to
53:49 use Twitter the API
53:52 but I I was saying that I had I was
53:55 taking a lot of time to get accepted as
53:57 a developer there I don't know why is
54:00 the reason maybe some people do it
54:01 faster but I couldn't myself so I said
54:04 okay
54:05 um and I was supposed to take uh I
54:08 wanted to do uh to take to scrape
54:11 Twitter and specifically people were
54:13 talking about data talks club and
54:14 somehow uses data
54:16 and that's okay I can I cannot do that
54:18 so I went to the YouTube videos
54:21 and uh I was saying okay maybe I can do
54:23 something about that
54:25 so I took the YouTube API and I saw
54:29 actually a video from a
54:33 um somebody called Chris Jenkins I think
54:36 who was using the YouTube API and from
54:38 playlist
54:39 and she was taking the mathematics from
54:43 the videos number of comments number of
54:45 views all these and he was streaming to
54:49 a telegram I don't know he was when
54:51 there was something he knew a comment
54:54 will appear so I said okay I will use
54:56 kind of the same logic but I will put it
54:59 on a bigquery
55:02 and stream every like every second every
55:05 some seconds the uh the number of views
55:08 the comments and and the likes and
55:14 stream them in the dashboards
55:16 in uh from the big way to a house called
55:21 um
55:22 the dashboard that you can look at yeah
55:25 and put it on Locker and I that was a
55:28 streaming part and there was also like
55:30 other metrics that came as a batch you
55:35 know I didn't have to in my head okay
55:36 maybe it's not useful to put in a stream
55:38 maybe you can do it every
55:40 um schedule it for every day or yeah say
55:43 like a daily and it was another pipeline
55:47 um
55:48 yeah again there are struggles uh
55:50 struggle but it was useful uh but it was
55:52 it was funny but in the NBA in the end
55:56 the YouTube didn't allow me to use the
55:59 API for one more uh than uh I don't know
56:03 100 times per day so it was a bummer
56:05 couldn't uh make it in the end something
56:08 what I wanted but yeah it was a
56:12 again I took the tools that you had in
56:14 each video and to make something the key
56:16 that I wanted
56:19 yeah that sounds so cool
56:21 so like maybe for those who are
56:24 struggling with coming up with a
56:26 portfolio project because it's important
56:28 for freelance job or for those who are
56:30 now listening to this and taking the
56:33 course right now and they're struggling
56:35 with coming up with a project idea do
56:37 you have any recommendations for them
56:40 yeah find something that you personally
56:43 like
56:45 and um
56:46 try to see if there is a data about that
56:51 and if there maybe you can build like if
56:54 you see the engineering project the
56:55 dashboard or if it's a machine learning
56:57 envelopes like a
56:59 model and it's if it is it don't have to
57:03 be perfect like definitely not to be
57:05 perfect you just try make sure that you
57:09 have this nice idea that you like
57:11 and it will definitely
57:13 make you more eager and you're gonna
57:16 join more uh the whole thing the whole
57:20 building process
57:22 yeah yeah well if I don't know what I
57:24 like
57:25 yeah so that's um another philosophical
57:29 uh I think you should come go out there
57:32 and explore
57:34 uh maybe join yeah join a startup join
57:39 the corporate maybe do a break and try
57:41 to see what you're passionate about
57:43 um
57:44 explore like if it would be
57:47 reinforcement
57:52 explore part
57:54 okay well I guess we should be wrapping
57:58 up so maybe last question for you
58:00 do you have any resource recommendations
58:03 for anyone who is listening to this I
58:05 think you mentioned the Lean Startup
58:07 book maybe you have some other
58:09 recommendations yeah I I would
58:12 definitely again recommend people really
58:14 reading Lean Startup it will help them
58:16 either in startup or not
58:19 other whole idea of what process of
58:22 working
58:23 so I would recommend that book for data
58:26 scientists and then the machine learning
58:29 Engineers analysts I would recommend
58:31 also like a second part of it called
58:34 um lean Analytics
58:36 where is focusing a lot on the
58:40 measure part
58:42 and making up every building and finding
58:45 a good metrics
58:47 for your startup your project or yeah
58:51 whether you're you're doing uh it's it's
58:54 a 10 years ago that book but some a lot
58:58 of out of the parts are up to date
59:00 and the I think the the writers are
59:03 updating it
59:05 and um
59:07 I I would recommend also a book
59:12 um here
59:15 no I I'm not sure yeah I really like
59:19 this book now that I'm kind of finishing
59:21 the designing machine learning systems
59:24 yeah it looked uh very nice it's a book
59:28 by chip yeah cheap
59:31 yeah see I cannot pronounce it
59:34 yeah I will not attempts your last name
59:36 too so yeah and
59:40 um yeah check out the data talks love
59:43 thank you
59:44 yeah yeah we should be wrapping up
59:47 thanks
