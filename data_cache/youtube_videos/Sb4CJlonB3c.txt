0:04 okay thank you everyone for
0:06 coming today to our event and this event
0:09 is brought
0:10 to you by datatalks.club which is a
0:13 community of people who love data
0:16 we have weekly events and this is one of
0:19 these events
0:21 we have events on tuesday which are more
0:24 technical events with presentations
0:26 we next week we will have an event about
0:29 aws glue data brew which is a new tool
0:32 from
0:33 aws for data preparation
0:36 and we have a different kind of event
0:38 events on friday
0:40 which are more like q and a discussions
0:44 uh which we call live podcasts and today
0:47 we will talk about standing out
0:49 as a data scientist in the recruitment
0:51 process and then
0:53 next week we'll also talk about
0:54 mentoring
0:56 and during uh the talk today
0:59 you can ask anything you want and
1:02 we will use slider for that i now will
1:05 share a link
1:07 with you and i'll just put it in
1:11 chat and
1:14 after that we can start
1:19 okay so the link is in chat so during
1:21 our conversation
1:22 if any question comes up to you just
1:26 put it there and
1:30 let me take my notes
1:33 and let's start
1:37 um so last week we
1:41 talked about uh building data science
1:44 teams
1:44 and uh recruiting data scientists but
1:47 today the topic is slightly different
1:49 so we'll talk about the recruitment
1:51 process but from the candidates
1:53 point of view and we have a special
1:55 guest today
1:56 luke so you probably know luke as a
1:58 podcast host
1:59 usually you hear luke asking questions
2:02 but today the station is different
2:04 luke takes the guest seat and luke is
2:07 not only a podcast host
2:08 he is also a recruiter he is a
2:10 co-founder of neural ai
2:12 which is a company that specializes in
2:14 recruiting ai specialists data
2:16 scientists machine learning engineers
2:17 and others
2:18 and today luke will share his experience
2:20 with us and tell us how
2:22 data scientists and other data
2:23 professionals can stand out during the
2:25 recruitment process
2:26 uh hi look welcome hi
2:30 thanks uh so much for inviting me on the
2:32 show alexi this feels very weird
2:34 being on the other side of the uh the
2:37 fence now
2:39 yeah thanks for coming um so uh look uh
2:42 let's start with your background um so
2:45 can i can you tell us
2:46 uh how you started your career um like
2:48 how you got into ai
2:50 and how it led to com co-founding your
2:53 uh your own recruitment company
2:56 cool um so um firstly thanks for
2:59 inviting me on the show alexey but um
3:00 hi to everyone who's joined so as alexis
3:03 said my name is luke i'm i'm the
3:04 co-founder of neural air
3:06 um i i guess the history and the
3:10 background is
3:12 i've been recruiting in the data and
3:13 analytics space for probably close to 10
3:15 years now
3:17 and um historically that started as you
3:19 know the kind of traditional bi and
3:21 analytics piece and
3:22 naturally as things became more
3:23 prevalent in the industry like advanced
3:25 analytics and data science machine
3:27 learning and deep learning
3:28 you know my career kind of transitioned
3:30 with it right um
3:32 but i think like most people in
3:33 recruitment you know 99
3:36 of us all fell into it and then you know
3:39 most people fall out of love with it but
3:41 you know i've stuck it out for 10 years
3:42 now
3:43 and uh to be honest i think neural come
3:46 around
3:47 from a couple of different perspectives
3:49 but um
3:51 one of those perspectives was i i was
3:53 just about to turn
3:54 30 and uh i had two
3:57 choices that i could have made right so
3:59 i could even continue working
4:01 for businesses that i have to become a
4:03 part of and embrace their values and
4:05 you know embrace their processes and the
4:07 way that they work or
4:08 you know i build something that kind of
4:10 represents what i believe and
4:12 you know what i i feel about how
4:14 recruitment should be done
4:15 so naturally i went for the second
4:17 option and um you know that led us to
4:20 fail
4:20 to found neural um but for me i think
4:23 the second perspective uh perspective is
4:26 you know as most of you are probably
4:28 aware there's a general kind of
4:30 consensus about what the recruitment
4:31 industry is
4:32 and you know i really wanted to create a
4:34 business that kind of counterbalanced
4:37 the
4:37 bad reputation that a lot of recruitment
4:39 consultants have
4:41 so you know i wanted to create a
4:42 business that a is built on the
4:44 foundation of
4:45 providing value to the actual community
4:47 that we recruit for
4:49 and try and live by something that is
4:51 you know make uh deposits
4:52 into that industry not just withdrawals
4:55 um so you know
4:56 as alexis said i've run a podcast i'm
4:58 looking into running
4:59 uh ai events like similar to what this
5:01 is um
5:03 and ultimately i wanted to create more
5:05 of a community effort rather than hey
5:07 we've got jobs you've got candidates or
5:09 you have vice versa you've got cb we've
5:11 got some jobs
5:12 you know i think that's very very old
5:14 school and very transactional
5:16 for me as i say you know neural was
5:18 built on the back of
5:19 wanting to create something different
5:21 that is
5:22 value and community driven rather than
5:24 just hey do you want to you want to work
5:26 out a new business
5:28 um so yeah we started in uh
5:31 early 2020 so probably not the best
5:34 time to start a business in the bits of
5:35 a global pandemic but
5:37 um you know i think the value
5:38 proposition that we've got and um
5:40 the the specialism in data um
5:43 and artificial intelligence has has
5:45 really hit the mark so
5:47 um yeah that's a bit about me and a bit
5:49 about my background
5:50 i hope that gives you a good snapshot
5:52 yeah and indeed uh
5:54 like what you said about bad reputation
5:56 of uh recruiters uh i think everyone can
5:59 uh
5:59 agree to that that sometimes uh they
6:02 just come
6:03 out of nowhere uh calling but uh i can
6:06 tell you that luke is different and this
6:07 is uh
6:09 and this is really great that what
6:10 you're doing like all these podcasts and
6:12 uh uh the plans for events i think that
6:15 that that is really awesome it's not
6:17 just a
6:18 cold call out of nowhere but actually
6:20 like a community
6:21 around that that's uh that's really
6:23 great and thank you look for doing that
6:25 yeah but uh coming back to your uh main
6:28 work as a recruiter
6:30 um like a guess data science may
6:34 be i don't know if it's different from
6:36 usual
6:38 developer positions or maybe analysts
6:41 but
6:41 i know that there are not not so many
6:44 good candidates
6:45 and yeah so typically it's quite
6:48 difficult to close
6:49 positions right so what does usually uh
6:52 what does it involve to close a position
6:54 what the typical steps
6:57 how how you go around that yeah um it is
7:02 definitely more
7:03 difficult than your average kind of
7:05 development role because
7:06 um you know you've probably experienced
7:08 this as well you know if you speak to a
7:09 hundred different people or a hundred
7:11 different businesses and say oh what is
7:12 a data scientist
7:14 and you're probably gonna get 100
7:15 different answers so i think one of the
7:17 big challenges for us
7:18 is every single position that we work
7:22 on is quite different from the last
7:26 right and every single business that we
7:28 work with has a definition
7:30 of what a machine learning engineer does
7:32 or what a data scientist does or what
7:34 xyz
7:35 does so i think one of the big problems
7:37 about
7:38 or the big challenges of the work that
7:39 we do is that every single company
7:41 is different right um and that in itself
7:45 is a
7:46 challenge because you need to first
7:48 understand the problems and the
7:49 different challenges that those
7:50 individual businesses
7:52 are facing and it's difficult to kind of
7:54 group
7:55 stuff together when everyone's got a
7:56 different perspective on stuff right
7:58 so i think you know i can't remember the
8:00 last time i worked in easy position
8:02 you know i don't think there's such a
8:04 thing in data science and ai community
8:06 especially at a senior level um but for
8:09 me i think our process
8:10 breaks down into like to just give you a
8:13 real quick bullet point for what we do
8:15 um it breaks down into six
8:18 key areas so number one is role
8:20 definition so typically we'll work with
8:22 businesses to help them
8:24 uh define the actual positions within
8:26 the business
8:27 um and you know a lot of companies still
8:29 struggle with that
8:30 because it's still such a new undefined
8:33 market so
8:34 you know we help companies define the
8:36 actual positions that they're looking
8:37 for
8:38 and offer guidance in terms of um what's
8:41 achievable and what's not
8:43 um secondly um we are heavily network
8:47 focused in terms of the
8:48 uh the candidates that we typically
8:50 provide so
8:52 um as a business we don't advertise um
8:55 we kind of do a little bit but that's
8:56 not our main source of
8:58 um you know candidate attraction so um
9:01 for us the second point is we would
9:03 market map um the talent pools of people
9:05 that they're potentially looking for
9:07 both from our network and from a heads
9:09 hunting perspective
9:10 so that essentially it'll be the people
9:12 that we know and the people that we
9:13 don't know
9:14 um thirdly we would put together a long
9:18 and short list so a long list is
9:19 essentially
9:20 the people that we think could be okay
9:22 for the role or has quite a lot of
9:23 crossover
9:24 and and then the short list of the
9:26 people that we spoke to we know that are
9:28 right for that position
9:29 um we then deliver the cvs and present
9:32 into the business
9:33 um following that we would manage that
9:36 process
9:36 of recruitment so um that goes
9:40 pretty much you've got to think of us as
9:43 like your
9:44 uh your interview buddy that's probably
9:48 a really bad way to describe it but
9:50 um you know we manage the process from
9:52 end to end both from a client and
9:53 candidate perspective so
9:55 um interview preparation feedback we
9:57 deliver that we help you prepare
9:59 um we highlight concerns or positives in
10:02 the process um
10:04 and you know if there are problems or
10:05 challenges you know we tend to bring
10:07 that to the table and we
10:08 try and overcome them with both
10:10 candidate and client
10:11 um and then lastly uh when we get to
10:14 that stage
10:15 um you know we manage the closing of the
10:18 process so
10:19 both from an ego often negotiation
10:21 perspective but also from
10:23 resignation and any kind of problems
10:25 that come up in the process so
10:27 um what i wouldn't say we are is a
10:32 we're not a traditional recruitment
10:34 company whereby
10:35 we do everything and you know we do
10:38 development cloud data uh
10:42 product you know we don't do that and
10:44 the clients will typically work on our
10:46 work with us on singular positions or
10:49 you know two or three positions but
10:50 they'll be on
10:51 an exclusive basis um and we will be
10:54 essentially
10:55 an extension of that company that we're
10:56 working with um
10:58 and that means we run the process from
11:00 full end to end
11:02 okay and usually how many candidates you
11:06 speak with uh like and what i'm trying
11:09 to ask is
11:10 how wide is the final like how many
11:12 people you have on this short
11:14 list how many people use you talk to you
11:17 speak or you get on the phone
11:18 and then uh to get just one to to just
11:21 close one position
11:22 yeah yeah um
11:26 i think that it's it's so different from
11:29 position to position right and because
11:31 as i say we work on those kind of
11:32 singular positions
11:34 um some roles that we work on could be
11:37 in the hundreds
11:38 um there's a role that i'm working on at
11:40 the moment where i'm doing a european
11:42 wide search and i've spoke to
11:44 i've sorry i've long listed probably
11:46 about 25 candidates across the whole of
11:48 europe
11:48 so it's really really vast from um
11:52 you know 10 to 20 candidates up to 2 300
11:55 candidates depending on the type of
11:57 position
11:58 um what i would say though is you know i
12:00 mentioned this earlier we don't
12:02 we don't actively advertise like that's
12:05 not our
12:05 key we don't say right we we advertise
12:09 lots of positions and stuff
12:10 so we don't deal with probably the
12:13 volume of candidates that
12:15 say you guys are no lx words right um
12:18 let's give an example one of my clients
12:20 in munich
12:21 for one position for an ai engineer they
12:24 received
12:25 i think it was like 1300 cvs um
12:28 we would never look at that amount of
12:30 cvs um
12:32 ever yeah um so
12:35 we're not volume but i'd say on average
12:37 we probably look
12:38 between 10 and 20 cvs a day something
12:41 like that
12:42 um and that's across like all positions
12:44 that we're working on
12:47 well 10 20 cvs per day still quite a few
12:51 cvs to look at of course uh yes not the
12:54 high the volume that we have to deal
12:55 with like our recruiters have to deal
12:57 with but it's still quite uh
12:59 yeah quite a lot of cvs that you need to
13:02 look at uh
13:03 every day and these things
13:07 you know everyone that we work with i'd
13:09 say probably 90 95 percent of the people
13:12 that we work with
13:13 we are approaching so um
13:16 it might not necessarily just be a cv
13:19 but it might be
13:20 um setting up conversations with people
13:22 on linkedin and stuff like that so
13:24 um i'd say profiles in general i'll
13:26 probably be
13:27 between 10 20 between 10 and 20. um
13:30 but that might be going through
13:32 something's linkedin or an actual
13:33 profile or
13:34 x110 okay
13:37 and what in this
13:41 uh like in these 1020 profiles what
13:44 does usually get your attention like
13:48 what do you look at uh typically like
13:50 when you say okay
13:52 i really have to call this candidate
13:53 when you know that uh okay this
13:55 candidate is
13:56 really good versus okay i'm not sure uh
13:58 maybe i'll
13:59 talk to this person later when i first
14:03 deal with these candidates
14:07 so i think um so when we spoke about
14:11 this before i tried to look back at some
14:12 of the old cvs that i've been like yes
14:14 they look amazing
14:16 um and i'll try and substantiate all of
14:18 these points so it kind of makes it
14:20 really easily
14:21 understandable but um i think if i start
14:23 from the kind of first
14:25 opening of the cv
14:27 [Music]
14:28 and again just as a disclaimer for
14:30 anyone who's listening right now
14:32 um this is just one person's view and
14:34 it's again very subjective right
14:36 um but i'm a bit of a sucker for good
14:39 design
14:39 from an artistic perspective um because
14:42 i think that that is something
14:44 that your reader will see
14:47 before they start reading your cv so
14:51 you know i try and live by something
14:53 which is your interview starts
14:55 as soon as they open your cv and before
14:58 they start reading your cv
14:59 the first thing that they see is how
15:01 well you've designed your cv actually is
15:03 right so i always comment when i can
15:06 clearly see that someone has taken the
15:08 time
15:08 to format and design their cv in a way
15:12 that is
15:13 um really attractive um
15:16 not to say that that is to be on mental
15:18 but i think you know this is kind of the
15:20 representation of
15:21 you right so if i open the cv and it
15:23 looks great
15:24 i'm instantly interested about what's on
15:26 the cv
15:28 whereas if i open the cv and think um
15:30 that
15:31 looks pretty awful um it you know it
15:34 kind of sets a negative tone before
15:35 someone's even started reading so
15:37 from my perspective i think design is a
15:39 really big part of that but
15:40 um if we're talking about content
15:42 specifically
15:44 um for me it breaks down into three
15:49 key areas that i instantly look for and
15:51 try and tick boxes in my own head
15:54 so again you know this is a disclaimer
15:57 but
15:57 you know businesses pay us to find
16:00 specific people so
16:01 we're probably a lot more critical on
16:03 the profiles that we're looking at
16:06 and i think there's definitely a
16:07 difference between being an internal
16:09 talent acquisition
16:10 the headhunter um but
16:13 the the three things that are there so
16:15 number one is
16:16 i'll instantly look for um the crossover
16:20 between the business and the role
16:21 that they're applying for with the
16:24 company
16:25 that they're currently working in now
16:27 the reason that
16:28 i say that is not because it's a name
16:30 game or
16:31 it's not because it's all about the
16:33 business that you work for
16:35 but it's primarily to do with the
16:37 industry challenges that that business
16:39 is facing
16:40 and how well would you be able to
16:42 actually understand those industry
16:43 challenges
16:44 so for example if you're
16:48 i don't know a data scientist at audi
16:50 and you're applying for a data science
16:51 position at bmw
16:53 and you're instantly recognized more
16:56 because you unders or you should
16:58 understand the industry that you're
16:59 working in
17:00 and the conversation that you can have
17:02 internally
17:03 um with the business that you're
17:05 applying for will be a lot higher than
17:07 someone who doesn't understand that
17:08 industry
17:09 so again this is not a name game but
17:12 it it definitely does add value to your
17:15 cv when i say right
17:16 i'm looking for someone for i don't know
17:19 bmw or
17:20 zolando or adidas or an autonomous
17:23 driving startup
17:24 and the first thing that i see is that
17:25 you're working in a very very similar
17:27 business
17:28 that's point one um point number two
17:32 is and this is kind of i do this in
17:35 conjunction right because it's not just
17:36 all about
17:37 that business it's mainly to do with the
17:40 use cases
17:41 and the actual projects that you're
17:43 working on right now so um
17:45 you know i i tend to test or tend to
17:47 look for
17:48 how close or how far you are away from
17:52 the actual use cases and problems that
17:54 you're going to be working on
17:55 because again you know the clients are
17:58 the clients that we'll typically work
17:59 with they come to us with specific roles
18:01 working on specific things so
18:05 my first thing is okay cool how close
18:07 are you from a business perspective
18:08 secondly how close are you from a used
18:10 case perspective and like
18:11 how much crossover is actually there
18:13 across those two things
18:15 because if those two things aren't there
18:18 it's actually really
18:19 difficult you know maybe other
18:22 headhunters have got a different spin on
18:23 this but
18:24 um you know for me i think that
18:26 culturally you could be great from an
18:28 alignment perspective
18:29 and you probably could be good for that
18:32 business but
18:33 you know from a head hunting perspective
18:36 so if we were working together right now
18:38 alexi and you said to me hey
18:40 i need this this this this and this and
18:42 the
18:43 profile that i gave to you in response
18:46 to that
18:46 didn't have any of that but i said like
18:48 you'll really like this person and
18:50 culturally they'll fit in
18:51 your feedback would be that's not what
18:53 we're looking for
18:54 so again those are the first two things
18:56 but then lastly
18:57 um i do look for that kind of cultural
19:00 and
19:03 industry alignment so this isn't
19:05 typically like the business per se
19:08 but it's kind of like the type of
19:11 business that you're working for
19:12 so if you're working for a huge global
19:16 um financial services business and
19:18 you're applying for a 10-man
19:20 startup company there are going to be
19:22 some huge different
19:24 cultural differences between those two
19:26 businesses right
19:28 and that for me i'm like are they going
19:30 to get that industry and vice versa
19:32 right
19:32 if you if you've had a start-up career
19:36 are you going to get working in a big
19:37 financial services industry
19:39 and you know nine times out of ten
19:41 there's so much
19:42 um there's so much difference between
19:44 those industries
19:45 um or businesses that it usually doesn't
19:48 work right
19:50 um so that's kind of the first thing
19:52 that i look for and that's the first
19:54 thing that kind of pops up but
19:56 i i suppose on top of that um
20:00 and one of the things that really gets
20:01 me about cbs is sometimes i'll open a
20:03 profile
20:04 and their tech stack overview and their
20:05 like their profile not their projects
20:08 looks amazing right and they've got
20:10 every tech on there
20:11 every programming language tensorflow
20:13 prior torch all different use cases
20:16 and then i actually look at the projects
20:17 that they've been working on and those
20:19 two things are
20:19 not linked so it's kind of just like
20:22 buzzword bingo on their cv but the
20:24 actual projects and the
20:26 um you know things they've actually done
20:28 don't link
20:29 to that right so for me i think the
20:31 second point is the
20:34 and this is really obvious but your your
20:37 projects
20:38 are related to the text that you've got
20:40 there and um
20:41 you'll be surprised about how many
20:43 profiles don't do that
20:44 um and you know your your cv should be a
20:48 representation of what you're doing
20:49 right so
20:50 if you're if you claim to know x1z
20:54 you should be able to back that up with
20:55 specific examples of projects
20:57 and be able to illustrate that in your
20:59 cv
21:00 and just to to clarify like projects you
21:03 mean
21:04 not necessarily projects on github but
21:07 projects again
21:07 could be on cv on portfolio just you
21:10 know a list of projects that
21:12 this person has made has done previously
21:15 right
21:16 yeah so um i think it's both really it
21:20 depends on what level you're coming in
21:22 you know again and this is the difficult
21:24 thing it's all very singular
21:27 um you know that might be the case for
21:29 one person but
21:30 there might be a more junior candidate
21:32 trying to make a break into the industry
21:34 and then like you know i would want to
21:36 see what github projects or what
21:38 um you know personal projects you've
21:39 worked on which would again illustrate
21:42 that technical experience and that
21:43 understanding right but if you're more
21:45 senior
21:46 i if you if you tell me that you know x
21:50 you've got to show me where you've done
21:51 that or how you've used that right
21:54 um so yeah that's the second main point
21:57 is that you know i would want to see
21:59 the projects that you've worked on are a
22:01 representation of the tech stack that
22:03 you think that you know
22:05 you don't understand
22:08 and then lastly um i think this breaks
22:10 down into the kind of three key
22:11 categories which is tenure common themes
22:13 and growth
22:14 so what i mean by that is
22:19 i would want if i look at cv i would
22:21 want to see that someone had had
22:23 a good amount of time in the businesses
22:25 that they'd worked in and not
22:27 jumped from place to place for an extra
22:29 5k
22:30 or um you know just a new change of
22:33 scenery right so
22:35 as a you know a head hunter i think
22:37 right
22:38 are you someone who's gonna you know
22:40 carefully choose the right industry and
22:42 the right
22:43 um uh opportunity for you why are you
22:46 actually gonna stay down
22:47 um and then secondly the common themes
22:49 and growth it's like
22:51 well you know are you have you got a
22:54 purpose in terms of your
22:55 career right now right so have you done
22:59 a huge amount of broad projects and you
23:01 kind of go from one data science job to
23:02 another
23:03 or have you got right i'm really
23:05 interested in this sector or industry or
23:07 type of client and that's
23:09 where i'm really going and growth
23:11 obviously
23:12 you know i would want to see someone
23:14 progress in their career so if you're a
23:16 data scientist now but you as a data
23:17 scientist five years ago
23:18 my first question would be you know why
23:21 haven't you progressed
23:22 um and you know run me through that
23:25 right and i know there's going to be
23:26 some
23:27 examples of people that just want to do
23:28 that one particular position
23:31 um but you know i would want to
23:32 understand those kind of points so
23:35 uh yeah that's what i typically look for
23:37 sorry if i i just threw loads of
23:39 information out there maybe
23:40 just i'll let me try to summarize what
23:42 you said and then you'll tell me if
23:43 i got it right so first you look at the
23:45 design right so just
23:47 it shouldn't be completely uh you know
23:50 uh bad like i don't know how to say but
23:54 like
23:55 tasteless maybe like just a bit of
23:57 creativity will not hurt your cv right
24:00 just to you know uh at least get your
24:02 attention right but then you look at
24:04 the industry where the candidate works
24:06 so it should be
24:07 ideally as close as possible to the
24:10 industry
24:10 of your client uh also it
24:14 will like it also involves
24:17 cultural fit in a way that you know it's
24:19 uh
24:20 if your position is in startup it should
24:22 also be like
24:23 ideal candidate will have experience
24:26 working at the startup right
24:28 and then we also look at projects and
24:30 then uh what is important in projects
24:32 is uh that they are linked to actual
24:34 skills so it's not just a
24:36 bunch of buzzwords on cv but actually
24:38 for each project uh
24:40 it's clear for you how these skills were
24:42 used right
24:43 and then finally you look at people who
24:47 don't uh
24:47 jump too often from position to position
24:51 so who have some sort of focus maybe
24:54 if i can put it this way
24:58 and yeah and also you look at career
25:00 progression
25:01 right yeah they get it right yeah i
25:04 think with just on the use cases
25:06 um you know for me you know you can work
25:08 on recommendation systems in spotify or
25:10 get your guides
25:11 and then also work on you know
25:13 recommendation systems in zolando right
25:15 so
25:15 it's not it's not just it's about the
25:19 it's about finding balance between
25:21 understanding
25:22 those kinds of industries um and
25:25 understanding the use cases that those
25:26 industries would typically
25:28 work on right um because that's the
25:31 i think the thing with data science is
25:33 it's not necessarily
25:35 you know it's about understanding the
25:37 business problem to be able to apply
25:38 your skills
25:39 to solve those problems right um so for
25:42 me
25:42 it's kind of a combination between
25:44 thinking right do you know the industry
25:46 and do you know the use cases or do you
25:48 know the industry but might have
25:50 slightly different use cases
25:52 or do you know the use cases but might
25:54 have a slightly different
25:55 industry so it's one of those things
25:57 where you've got to kind of
25:58 look at it and balance and things right
26:00 well you know
26:02 what do they know and where can we kind
26:03 of make this work so it's
26:05 it's really different from candidates a
26:07 candidate and
26:08 again it's super subjective and very
26:10 singular um but that's
26:12 typically the stuff that i'll look for
26:14 but uh
26:15 from what i understood the important
26:17 thing is is to have
26:19 it to make it clear on cv what are the
26:21 use cases you worked on
26:23 so then when the recruiter like you
26:25 looks at the cv
26:26 it's immediately clear for them okay
26:29 these are things that the candidate
26:30 worked on
26:31 right these are the projects yeah the
26:33 the use cases these are the industries
26:35 and then for you it's immediately clear
26:37 okay this candidate is a good fit or
26:39 maybe
26:40 this candidate uh not necessarily a good
26:42 fit right
26:43 yeah sure okay and then uh like i also
26:46 wanted to ask you about the design
26:48 because usually like data scientists are
26:50 not designers right and
26:52 we yeah we don't spend a lot of time
26:55 uh using tools like canva or adobe
26:58 illustrator or whatever to come up with
27:00 uh you know an excellent cd
27:04 like designers would do and they wanted
27:08 to ask you like
27:09 yeah what is it that you you look in
27:11 this design like
27:14 like how a good design looks like to you
27:18 just curious yeah yeah um
27:21 so it doesn't have like i'm not saying
27:23 that this has to be like super colorful
27:24 and um you know uh you know it it
27:28 that's not necessarily what i'm saying
27:30 from a design perspective but
27:31 and what i am saying is it needs to be
27:34 clear
27:35 and
27:39 so it just needs to look
27:42 professionally clear right i know it's
27:46 not a very good way to describe it but
27:48 um you know some cvs are open and it's
27:50 clearly just been
27:51 you know there's been no thought in
27:52 terms of kind of how to you know put
27:54 that together and it's kind of just
27:56 this is kind of everything i've done
27:58 let's just throw that onto
27:59 you know uh
28:11 i also think it's very dependent on what
28:13 kind of business you're applying for so
28:15 if you're applying to an alliance or a
28:16 munich ray would i
28:18 advise having a really colorful cool
28:20 techie cv no
28:22 um you know i'd say you need to
28:23 professional you need to make that look
28:25 professional to
28:26 um you know kind of capture the audience
28:29 that you're talking to right because
28:30 again
28:31 you know the the moment someone opens
28:33 your cv they are judging
28:35 who you are so if you don't fit the mold
28:38 of the type of business that you're
28:39 applying to
28:40 be that startup or financial services or
28:43 whatever
28:44 then that first couple of seconds it
28:47 needs to hit
28:48 home with that individual business right
28:49 they need to think i think it's more of
28:51 a kind of psychological thing
28:52 but they need to think right that's the
28:55 type of view of us
28:56 as a business so i think the question
28:58 that you need to ask yourself
29:00 is what are you trying to portray to the
29:03 people that you
29:04 you're trying to network with you know
29:05 is it ultra professional
29:07 banking insurance uh corporate which is
29:11 fine
29:11 like you know if you wanted to go that
29:13 route then then double down there
29:14 or do you want to work with um you know
29:17 cool
29:18 techies startups you know what's that
29:20 kind of vibe in that kind of community
29:22 right
29:22 and you need to replicate that with the
29:25 profiles that you've built
29:27 and i hope that gives you a little bit
29:28 more color around that yeah
29:31 yeah and also as i understood it's not
29:33 only about like
29:34 how you uh choose colors but also how
29:37 you structure it
29:38 so it's not just a brain dump right you
29:40 just sit down and list
29:41 all the skills like all the technologies
29:43 you ever worked with
29:45 all the places of work like instead of
29:48 just giving a brain dump
29:50 just structure it right so it makes it
29:52 easy for the
29:53 receiver of this information to actually
29:55 go through this and
29:58 understand this information right it's
30:00 not about colors it's not about like
30:02 these
30:03 beautiful shapes but more like
30:07 yeah yeah exactly we have a question we
30:10 have a question from gujarat i hope i
30:12 pronounced the name correctly
30:13 um how often is too often changing jobs
30:16 uh what is the currently at the average
30:19 time
30:20 that the person stays in a job like what
30:22 would be a red flag for you
30:25 yeah um i think anything under a year is
30:27 a red flag
30:28 um a year to two years in most companies
30:32 is kind of about average now um anything
30:35 over a two-year period i'm like that's a
30:36 good amount of time to spend in a
30:38 a company right now um but yeah if
30:42 it's and it it's my it's not necessarily
30:44 about one thing that happens right so
30:47 um you know if you're if
30:51 everyone can make mistakes i've done it
30:52 in the past and you join a business
30:54 it doesn't turn out to be what you think
30:55 it is like that's totally fine right
30:58 um but if that's kind of a common theme
31:01 across
31:03 the experience you've got so if you've
31:05 had 12 roles
31:06 in 12 years and they've been on average
31:10 a year each you know for me that says to
31:13 me that you are
31:15 you you don't like sticking in one place
31:18 um
31:20 so yeah as a hedgehog that is concerning
31:23 because you know we
31:25 the the companies that we work with they
31:27 you know they want us to find people
31:28 that are going to stay in the business
31:29 to progress
31:30 all of that sort of stuff so um yeah i'd
31:32 say
31:33 it's more about the consistency of how
31:36 often you're moving so
31:39 if you had a really solid career and it
31:42 was you know two three years in most of
31:43 the positions you had
31:44 but one position was you know your last
31:46 position was
31:48 three or four months didn't work out
31:50 totally cool
31:51 but if it's that replicated across every
31:53 role you've worked in
31:54 that that's a concern okay
31:58 okay and there is also a question from
32:00 kaneka uh
32:01 you mentioned that you look for
32:03 background in a specific industry
32:05 but what about freshers who don't have
32:07 any background uh
32:08 do you also work with uh junior
32:10 candidates
32:13 yeah and in in this case uh yeah if you
32:16 do
32:16 like what do you look for in uh
32:19 candidates so i think we was going to
32:22 cover this a little bit
32:23 later but i'll dive into this now um so
32:25 i i
32:26 do work a bit with
32:30 um more junior candidates i wouldn't say
32:32 that's my key focus
32:33 um but i i do do that um and i think the
32:39 the key for me when i look for junior
32:41 candidates
32:43 and i think any candidate actually um is
32:45 having
32:47 purpose in their search um i know it
32:50 sounds a bit
32:51 fluffy but there are lots of candidates
32:57 but there are lots of candidates that i
32:59 open their cv and it literally looks
33:02 super generic like generic text stack
33:05 generic kind of overview generic
33:08 background
33:09 apply for anything not really any
33:11 direction in terms of where they want to
33:13 take their career
33:14 so my thoughts if and
33:17 you know my talks on this is if you're
33:20 trying to break into the industry
33:23 i think it's really difficult to go
33:25 broad
33:26 um i think where you'll be most
33:28 successful is if you pick
33:30 something or if you pick an industry or
33:32 if you pick a
33:33 um an area of data science and machine
33:35 learning that you're really passionate
33:37 about
33:37 and really doubling down on that so
33:40 taking autonomous drivers
33:42 uh as an example um you know if you're
33:45 passionate about that industry
33:47 then do things to illustrate that which
33:49 would bolster your
33:51 your profile and elevate you above the
33:53 people that are kind of generic
33:56 so um as a human being i try and do
33:59 i try and live by aim small um sorry aim
34:02 small miss small
34:03 um so for me i pick an industry and
34:05 think right
34:06 what can i do alongside the technical
34:08 skills
34:09 and you know the experience i'm trying
34:11 to gain what can i do outside of all of
34:14 that
34:14 that if someone opens my profile even
34:17 though you're junior or you're a
34:18 refresher or
34:19 you know whatever they look at you think
34:21 you're probably not there in seniority
34:23 but you definitely want to do this
34:25 like this is 100 what you want to do
34:28 so you know i'd start going to um you
34:31 know
34:31 tech meetups i'd start going to
34:33 conferences i'd start learning about the
34:35 industry
34:36 and start learning about from a
34:37 commercial business perspective
34:39 and all of this sort of stuff i would
34:40 highlight in your profile so
34:42 as someone opens it it's not just
34:45 okay cool they know tensorflow and they
34:47 know python and they know x which pretty
34:49 much everyone knows
34:51 you know you're setting yourself aside
34:54 from
34:54 the generic do anything kind of
34:57 candidate
34:58 so for me if you're if you're a junior
35:01 and you're trying to break into an
35:02 industry
35:03 find one or two industries that you're
35:05 really really interested in
35:06 and bolster your profile around that
35:09 industry
35:10 because that will give you a better
35:11 chance of entering that industry
35:15 yeah so like you said the one of the
35:16 first things you look at is the
35:18 match between like industry match uh
35:22 between what your client is looking for
35:24 and what is on the cv
35:25 and then for you it if it's clear what
35:29 the focus of a candidate is even if it's
35:31 a junior candidate
35:32 then it's already uh like it already is
35:37 the candidate already stands out from
35:38 the from the rest of the candidates
35:40 right because it's clear
35:41 that this person really wants to work in
35:44 this area
35:45 and which also happens to be the area of
35:47 your client right
35:50 exactly and you know for me i think that
35:52 when people
35:53 are clearly passionate about something
35:56 um
35:58 maybe i look at this from too much of a
36:00 human perspective but i'm like i want to
36:01 try and help that person because they
36:03 clearly want to do this so
36:05 um you know for me i you know ask any of
36:08 the clients i've worked with they're
36:10 always being
36:11 an instance where i'll be like hey let's
36:14 see
36:14 i know this guy's too junior but trust
36:16 me on this like this is the type of
36:18 person that in a year or two years time
36:19 will be an absolute superstar
36:21 and i don't think you get as many
36:23 opportunities to do that as a can today
36:25 or get those opportunities
36:27 for someone to represent you in that
36:28 kind of way if you approach the market
36:31 in like a really generic way and just
36:32 like
36:33 hey we'll do anything like spray and
36:35 pray
36:36 um you know for me you want people to
36:41 believe in you i know that again that is
36:44 getting super
36:45 cheesy and stuff but you know when i see
36:47 someone that clearly wants to do
36:48 something
36:49 you know i'll go out my way to try and
36:50 help that person and think right
36:53 this person in a couple of years will be
36:55 amazing so you know i'll try and
36:57 my hardest to help that person do that
37:00 so yeah even at a junior level
37:02 um you know i'll still look for okay
37:04 cool what are you doing outside of your
37:06 masters or what are you doing outside of
37:07 your internships that
37:09 promote your um your profile in the
37:12 industry or or focus that you want to
37:14 move into
37:16 yeah so i guess uh like if you really
37:19 want to
37:20 um tailor your application to a specific
37:24 position one thing you can do is of
37:26 course you need to show that you
37:29 really focus on this industry you really
37:30 like this industry
37:32 but is there anything else candidates
37:34 can do to
37:35 show that they're really interested in
37:38 this position
37:39 like let's say somebody is
37:42 applying to a position online
37:46 and they want to really make sure they
37:49 get this position
37:50 what are the things they can do for that
37:53 um so i'll give you my pc why
37:56 the right way to do it and then i would
37:58 give you what i would personally do
38:00 okay you know so most
38:03 like companies will probably hate me
38:05 saying stuff like this as well so uh
38:07 we'll cover that off in a bit but um so
38:10 number one
38:10 i think that i and again i know this is
38:13 simple and
38:14 probably some of your listeners are
38:15 rolling your eyes now but um
38:18 you absolutely need to read the job
38:19 descriptions before you apply
38:21 because it's not and
38:24 i know that sounds really stupid and
38:27 super simple but
38:29 the when you're tailoring your
38:30 application
38:32 you're not doing that to understand what
38:35 they're looking for
38:36 you're doing that so you can apply your
38:38 skills and
38:40 outline how you can help them solve
38:43 those problems right
38:45 so as a candidate or an applicant
38:48 you absolutely need to do some research
38:50 before you apply to a business
38:52 because again if your blanket sending
38:54 out your
38:55 um application and bearing in mind right
38:58 so like what we said earlier there are
39:00 companies out there that getting
39:01 1300 maybe more applications for a role
39:05 so you've got two options right you can
39:07 either throw your hat
39:08 into that and hopefully something
39:11 happens
39:12 or you can think right as a business
39:15 what are the problems that this company
39:17 is facing right now and what their
39:19 challenge is
39:20 how does my experience and what i've
39:23 done as an individual
39:25 how does that link to that and how can
39:28 you make the distinction between those
39:30 two things
39:31 so how do you start you know how you
39:33 need to out on
39:34 point um outline point a you think right
39:38 this is how those two things link so
39:40 again this links back to what i'm saying
39:42 it's not just about
39:43 um the industry or the use cases
39:47 specifically
39:48 it's about how can you link those two
39:50 things together
39:51 so first up i would
39:54 definitely outline that or try
39:58 as best as you can to outline the
40:00 challenges and problems that that
40:02 individual
40:03 company is facing secondly
40:06 i would put together a um
40:09 an email linkedin however you want to do
40:11 it but i
40:13 would um make it ultra targeted
40:17 um and i would make it super relevant
40:20 for the reader
40:20 so when you when that message lands with
40:23 someone
40:24 you want to take as much of the work off
40:26 of their plate as possible
40:27 so instead of them having to click into
40:29 their into your cv
40:31 and then trying to find that information
40:33 i would be like right
40:34 this is challenge a that you guys are
40:36 facing right now this is what i've done
40:38 that would solve that challenge
40:39 challenge b this is what i've done
40:41 challenge c this is what i've done
40:43 because i think the more you can tailor
40:45 that and make it very very specific for
40:47 that application
40:48 the more someone is going to open that
40:50 and think [ __ ] this guy as
40:51 really odd girl has really taken the
40:53 time to a
40:56 you know do their research and b it
40:58 looks like they know what we're trying
40:59 to do here right
41:00 so for me i'd put together those things
41:03 i'd make it ultra ultra targeted
41:06 but thirdly i would
41:11 see a highlight there's great problems
41:15 for you
41:16 you open their cv and it doesn't reflect
41:18 what you're saying in that email
41:20 so you need to adjust your cv based on
41:22 the conversations that you're trying to
41:24 have with
41:25 um you know the clients you're
41:26 approaching because again that is more
41:28 that's a representation
41:30 of your skills and what you've done in
41:33 the past right
41:34 and if it doesn't link to that they're
41:36 gonna say okay cool you sent a great
41:38 email but
41:39 actually what are you doing and you're
41:40 you know again what are you actually
41:42 doing in your
41:43 experience right um
41:46 and then lastly i think you need to
41:48 research and approach
41:50 the right people in the business um
41:54 so again companies will hate me for
41:58 saying this
42:00 but i personally wouldn't
42:06 i'm not going to say it essentially but
42:09 i i wouldn't you know i i'm not a big
42:12 fan of throwing my hat
42:13 into a thousand applications that's not
42:17 personally the way that i would do it if
42:19 i was going to try and approach a
42:20 business i would find the right people
42:22 that i wanted to talk to and i would
42:25 approach them
42:26 directly but i wouldn't do it in a
42:28 blanket way
42:30 that's just going to piss people off
42:31 because people know if you've taken the
42:33 time to approach them with something
42:35 valuable
42:36 that's targeted if you do that
42:39 you'll have a really great impression
42:40 with that business if you do it in a
42:42 blanket way a lot of the time it will be
42:45 disregarded
42:46 and it will just piss people off so my
42:48 my thing is if you're going to approach
42:50 people directly
42:51 which i would um
42:54 firstly i would do it in a really
42:56 targeted way that that
42:58 person will know that you've taken the
43:00 time to do that
43:01 now is everyone going to respond to you
43:03 probably not but the people that do
43:05 and the people that appreciate that sort
43:06 of stuff will
43:09 they'll be like a sponsor for you into
43:11 the business so to give an example
43:13 um a friend of mine recently um he moved
43:17 out of recruitment and into a a software
43:20 sales job
43:21 and the way that he approached it was he
43:23 filmed himself
43:25 giving an overview of him as a human
43:27 being and what he does and his
43:29 experience
43:30 and the value that he can bring to
43:31 organizations um
43:33 but he reached out to um sales directors
43:37 within like you know big
43:38 software um vendors like domo
43:41 um uh who else did we chat to salesforce
43:44 companies like that right
43:45 um and he was like look this is what i
43:47 do and this is why i'd love to work for
43:49 you guys but it was all super
43:50 like super targeted so as the hiring
43:53 managers opened all of these video cvs
43:56 they were like this guy's taking the
43:58 time to do this
43:59 and he had multiple companies come back
44:01 to him and say
44:03 we've not seen anything like that before
44:04 um like
44:06 thank you for taking the time to do that
44:08 and he landed one of the jobs with one
44:09 of those companies
44:10 and now that company uses his approach
44:13 with the sales tactics that they have so
44:14 anyway it's just an example that if
44:16 you're going to
44:16 approach people directly and do that
44:19 make it target
44:20 so when it lands with them they can see
44:22 you've put the time and effort into
44:24 doing that
44:25 yeah but yeah i guess like if you want
44:28 to
44:29 like you really need to focus on a few
44:30 positions because
44:32 there is no way you can do that for 10
44:35 on 20 position that just too much time
44:37 right so you really need to
44:39 pick an area where you want to focus and
44:41 then finding companies that you really
44:43 want to work with
44:44 and then approach everyone individually
44:47 right
44:47 yeah if it um this leans back on to what
44:51 i was saying about having purpose in
44:53 your
44:53 career right so if you can segment
44:57 your purpose and say let's take
44:59 autonomous driving for example
45:01 it's quite easy to break down all of the
45:03 autonomous driving businesses in germany
45:05 for example
45:07 so you know if you look at machine
45:09 learning engineer
45:10 yeah like how are you going to approach
45:12 that there's what like 4 000 jobs in
45:14 germany right now
45:15 so yeah where do you start with that but
45:17 if you say right i'm looking for ad
45:18 startups or something in the autonomous
45:20 drive space
45:21 or on the secondary kind of level in
45:23 berlin
45:24 that's an easily digestible way
45:27 that you can say right this is what i'm
45:29 going to try and do
45:31 and this is the industry and the kind of
45:32 the landscape i'm trying to do it
45:35 um so yeah everything needs to kind of
45:38 feed into
45:38 one another i think yeah so
45:42 we have a couple questions on sliders uh
45:45 i'll um
45:47 yeah i think uh we should
45:51 maybe you'll like this so uh
45:54 if somebody wants to change their career
45:57 from
45:57 academy to industry what can they do
46:01 like how can they stand out like how
46:04 they can compete with people who already
46:06 have
46:06 experience in industry because usually
46:08 like when you're hiring somebody you
46:11 already want to have somebody with
46:13 experience right
46:14 how can these people who just maybe
46:16 created a good phd or worked in academia
46:19 how can they
46:20 make this transition do you have any
46:22 recommendations
46:24 yeah that is a really good question and
46:26 something that people struggle with
46:27 constantly
46:28 um just just for clarity is this person
46:31 talking about
46:32 um if they're coming from like a
46:33 research role in one of the universities
46:36 or are they talking about from
46:38 yeah so um i think the biggest challenge
46:41 that
46:42 i find is that
46:45 companies push back or the clients that
46:47 i work with they push back on the fact
46:49 that
46:51 the people that are coming from those
46:53 research and academic positions
46:56 don't have the product mindset
46:59 that they need to be able to create to
47:01 be able to do the positions
47:03 so what i mean by that is
47:06 you know i'm speaking pretty broadly
47:08 here and like you know tiring everyone
47:10 with the same brush but
47:11 you know a lot of the time they have a
47:13 research for research
47:16 mindset um and they don't have
47:20 that commercial business mindset
47:25 and not from a business strategic
47:26 perspective but they don't have that
47:28 right we need to make [ __ ] happen and we
47:31 need to actually do
47:32 something rather than just research and
47:35 we have all the time in the world
47:36 and you know it it kind of comes down to
47:39 that different mindset shift of moving
47:42 out of cool we're doing academic
47:44 research now and we really want to find
47:46 like cool
47:46 answers and we really want to do it for
47:48 the research state which is
47:50 also extremely valuable v
47:54 actually we're building this product to
47:55 sell because any business
47:59 that isn't that's not researching uh you
48:02 know academia
48:03 they're there to make money right and
48:06 it's the difference in mindset between
48:09 academic research to okay cool we're
48:11 here to actually build a product to sell
48:13 to people
48:14 um so i think the mindset thing is the
48:16 biggest
48:18 um change or the biggest challenge you
48:21 would need to make and
48:22 would help you transition out of that so
48:24 that internal narrative
48:26 that you have about what you do you need
48:28 to switch that from
48:30 that piece to that piece um i can
48:34 definitely help you with that so if you
48:35 want to connect to me on linkedin i can
48:36 talk you through that in more detail um
48:38 but secondly i think it's about
48:41 um it's really difficult because if
48:44 you've got an opportunity to do
48:45 something
48:46 internally at an academic institute
48:49 to productionize something do it because
48:52 then you've got experience in actually
48:55 productizing something and you know
48:58 there are people that i've worked with
48:59 in the past that
49:01 have done that in you know kind of small
49:03 terms so it's not just all research
49:05 but on top of that i would start looking
49:08 at personal projects about what you can
49:09 do in the background to add on top of
49:11 um the research you're doing i would
49:13 think right well what am i researching
49:16 how can i apply that in a real world
49:17 scenario and do a personal project on it
49:20 and because then you're again that shows
49:23 me commitment
49:23 right because i say look you know i know
49:26 that i hadn't
49:26 had the production level experience that
49:28 this is what i've done to counteract
49:29 that
49:30 and and then again when you send your
49:32 profile to someone you need to highlight
49:34 the connection between those two things
49:36 um so yeah for me i think the easiest
49:39 thing you would do is
49:40 uh understand the mindset of the
49:42 businesses that you're trying to apply
49:43 for
49:44 and then secondly start working on
49:46 personal projects that would
49:48 um complement the research work that
49:50 you've been doing
49:53 or find a project at university yeah i
49:56 know that some universities have
49:58 collaboration with camp with companies
49:59 with the industry and i think
50:01 it's a really good idea to try to get in
50:04 these
50:05 projects and learn from that
50:09 then we also have a question um
50:12 are there people that are really
50:13 passionate about positions in
50:15 advertisement
50:16 or marketing
50:26 why does wanting a job for money make
50:28 you a better
50:30 benefit it's actually two questions i
50:33 guess yeah yeah yeah
50:37 in one yeah uh well
50:41 i don't know maybe you know maybe
50:44 um i'm just you know my perspective
50:47 so the people that i've seen really
50:49 accelerate their career
50:51 quickly and to high levels other people
50:53 that have real key focus
50:55 and there's nothing wrong with taking a
50:56 job and um you know focusing purely on
50:59 the financial part
51:00 if that's your if that's your focus and
51:02 that's your goal go for it
51:03 go and work for a mckinsey and work 90
51:05 hours a week
51:06 and you know that's where you're gonna
51:09 you know
51:10 earn the most amount of money right so i
51:12 don't think there's anything necessarily
51:14 wrong with
51:15 doing the other side of that and just
51:17 taking the job for financial benefits
51:19 um but it's so subjective right and it
51:23 depends on you as a human so
51:25 um if you find something and again you
51:27 know for me
51:28 i'm looking at the people that i've seen
51:30 be really successful in the profiles i
51:32 see and think [ __ ] they're brilliant
51:33 it's because they've got key focus and
51:36 even if that is marketing
51:38 um you know there are going to be
51:39 companies out there that would be like
51:41 great that's exactly what we need so
51:44 it's not necessarily all about the
51:45 industry per se it's about having your
51:47 focus
51:48 in terms of what you want to do if
51:50 that's financial
51:51 that's financial if it's right i want to
51:53 progress my career
51:55 in my experience the quickest way to do
51:56 that is by having a focus
51:59 be that industry or area i hope
52:02 does that answer your question i hope it
52:04 did yeah i have a follow-up question for
52:07 that uh
52:08 yeah what is your opinion on people who
52:10 you reach out and the first thing they
52:12 ask is hey but what is the salary
52:14 like is it for you a red flag or
52:18 like it's a normal thing how do you
52:20 react to that
52:21 um you know what i think i totally um
52:24 empathize with everyone that works in
52:26 this industry
52:28 because they're contacted every single
52:30 day by
52:31 hundreds of recruiters with [ __ ] roles
52:34 paying [ __ ] salaries
52:35 um for me i think it's fair play
52:38 like you know do you want to waste your
52:40 time having a conversation with someone
52:42 if number one they can't pay the money
52:43 that you you need um so for me it's
52:47 never a red flag because i appreciate
52:49 how frustrating it must be from
52:51 their side um if
52:55 the sole focus on their new job search
52:59 is
52:59 financial it does that is a bit of a red
53:03 flag to me
53:04 personally because um you're going to go
53:06 where the money
53:07 is and if another company is paying more
53:10 money than the clients that i'm working
53:12 with
53:12 that's a big concern um but yeah um like
53:16 you know
53:16 there's a lot of debate in the
53:18 recruitment world
53:20 um about how much information you should
53:22 share
53:23 in the first approach and i'm on the i'm
53:26 on the side of um
53:28 i'll give you the job specs the client
53:30 names salaries whatever you need
53:32 to be able to make an accurate decision
53:33 on should we have a conversation
53:36 oh i'll give you that information
53:37 because i don't think you can tell
53:40 being an honest business if someone asks
53:42 you a question and you
53:43 you don't answer it um yeah so for me
53:46 you know it's not a red flag i think
53:48 it's i think that stems from a lot of
53:50 wasted time
53:51 uh by ship recruiters it's actually like
53:54 90 percent of recruiters in my
53:56 experience when i ask them hey what what
53:59 is the company
54:00 they don't answer so this is uh like
54:03 what you're doing is clearly different
54:05 from the rest of uh external
54:08 recruiters i really appreciate that i
54:10 think uh the only reason why they do
54:12 that as well alexis because
54:13 even and again this just highlights how
54:15 much of a
54:17 bad in industry recruitment can be
54:19 sometimes is that people will put
54:21 together fake
54:22 profiles of fake candidates um
54:25 to extract leads from recruiters that
54:28 will share that information right
54:30 um but in my career i don't think i've
54:33 ever
54:33 not once had a candidate and they also
54:36 say that oh well you could apply
54:37 directly for the business
54:38 um and uh and cut me out of it kind of
54:41 thing
54:42 in my career i've never ever had that so
54:44 that's never ever been a situation i've
54:46 experienced
54:48 okay yeah so there's all we also have a
54:51 question from kistela
54:52 um about cv styles um
54:56 she grew up in germany and live in the s
54:58 and she sees that
54:59 the styles of cvs are different
55:03 in your experience like how different
55:06 like cvs that you're getting like are
55:08 they vastly different or
55:10 maybe they most of them follow the same
55:12 structure
55:15 yeah um germany's got a very distinct
55:17 style in terms of the
55:19 kind of classical profile um
55:23 yeah it's pretty there's a lot of that
55:26 um i think the ones that really stand
55:29 out for me are the ones that are
55:30 uh unique and they take the time to
55:33 think oh actually
55:34 well this is a representation of me so
55:39 yeah and there are definitely been times
55:42 in the past where someone says oh
55:44 what do you think about this because
55:45 this is how you should do it in germany
55:48 and i would think well like why
55:51 like who are the people that are
55:53 managing the kind of german
55:55 uh cv format like you know i i think
55:58 personally it should be a personal
55:59 representation of you so it should be a
56:01 personal
56:02 thing um so yeah
56:05 and there is but i would definitely go
56:08 against
56:08 it and also i have a related question
56:13 um because in the states um usually they
56:16 focus like they really
56:17 i think it's every uh blog post that you
56:20 read
56:21 they say your cv has to be one page long
56:25 not yeah like one page for 10 years of
56:28 experience
56:28 but in germany i've seen like cvs that
56:32 are five pages long six pages long
56:34 and uh yeah sometimes i saw a cv
56:36 recently 10 pages long with
56:38 you know like it felt like a novel
56:42 what is your opinion like how long cv
56:45 should be
56:46 yeah um so i think like the ideal length
56:49 is two pages
56:50 um i i honestly don't think you can get
56:53 enough content on one page to make it
56:56 sing um i think three pages
56:59 is like borderline too much but i think
57:01 two pages is kind of like
57:02 ideal because that's kind of the balance
57:04 between having enough content
57:07 deep content that will give me context
57:10 of what you do
57:11 but also limit you in terms of war and
57:14 peace right
57:15 so i think two pages is kind of the
57:18 ideal
57:19 number but you know again i think if you
57:23 can keep someone's
57:24 attention for five pages then awesome
57:27 but nine times out of ten there's
57:29 a lot of content in there that's kind of
57:32 irrelevant and it could just kind of
57:33 like overload right
57:35 um so yeah for me um i would say that
57:39 two pages are
57:40 like okay the drain yeah so
57:43 it keeps you focused but also doesn't
57:45 let you you know just brain dump and
57:47 uh yeah do you have uh
57:51 uh five ten more minutes
57:56 we have four more questions uh so
57:59 nishant is asking
58:00 um is it okay to write
58:03 a job a job title in cv that
58:08 more closely represent
58:11 the work they are doing instead of you
58:12 know putting the official title because
58:14 i know from my experience i know some
58:16 companies put
58:17 manager in the role just for the sake i
58:20 don't know why they do this but
58:22 often like an analytics manager and that
58:25 person doesn't manage any
58:27 uh any other people right is it okay if
58:30 these people let's say instead of
58:32 putting analytics manager
58:33 put data on list in their cv like it's
58:36 not the initial date title that they
58:37 have
58:38 um but maybe it follows the industry
58:41 trends
58:43 rather than a particular
58:47 job grid job description in the company
58:50 yeah
58:50 um personally i think it is but as long
58:53 as you're not
58:54 lying about what you're doing so for
58:57 example
58:58 is it okay to write um a
59:01 software engineer if your job title
59:03 software developer
59:04 um you know i think that that's okay is
59:07 it okay to write see
59:08 uh lead software engineer if you're like
59:11 a gym you know that's not okay right
59:13 um so i think um i think it's okay to
59:17 align it
59:18 but as long as it is
59:21 not so far past reality that it could be
59:24 considered a lie
59:25 so you know if you are doing those
59:27 things but your job title is slightly
59:29 off
59:29 and you're applying for a date science
59:30 position um
59:32 and you know your job title is i don't
59:34 know um
59:36 i'd like something um that isn't that
59:39 then
59:39 you know for me it's okay to slightly
59:42 adjust it
59:43 to you know hit the mark but yeah not at
59:47 the extent of flying
59:48 i don't think you should ever lie on a
59:49 cv um but i do think you should align
59:52 on your cb
59:56 um if previous commercial experience in
59:59 a field
1:00:00 loosely related to data science or
1:00:02 machine learning
1:00:03 is it advantage or drawback asking us
1:00:06 someone who wants to switch from web
1:00:07 developer
1:00:09 to machine learning uh
1:00:14 you could you could probably give a
1:00:16 better answer to that but um i think
1:00:18 that um i'm not i'm not
1:00:21 too knowledgeable in the kind of like
1:00:25 web dev to
1:00:26 uh data science field i think anyone who
1:00:29 comes from a
1:00:30 programming background in general
1:00:34 if you move into data science i do think
1:00:35 that that gives you a good
1:00:37 platform to be able to learn programming
1:00:40 and engineering as a whole so
1:00:42 i think that there's definitely
1:00:43 crossover and if you've got more
1:00:45 appreciation for the wider parts of
1:00:47 um the organization that you would have
1:00:48 interaction with so like ux and ui and
1:00:51 that kind of piece then yeah like it you
1:00:53 know it's never going to do any harm um
1:00:56 is it going to be directly relatable
1:01:00 so i think what you're asking is you
1:01:02 know would i look at someone who's come
1:01:04 from that background think wow that's
1:01:05 great
1:01:06 um i wouldn't but what i would think is
1:01:11 that's good because you you've probably
1:01:13 got a good
1:01:14 foundation to learn from so as long as
1:01:17 the
1:01:17 um you know what you do on top of that
1:01:19 is a good um
1:01:22 uh you know from an educational
1:01:24 standpoint you've taken the time to kind
1:01:26 of learn
1:01:27 uh you know the other areas in depth
1:01:30 um you know then i think it is always a
1:01:32 good uh always a good thing
1:01:34 but i don't think that that will be the
1:01:36 thing that will get you the job
1:01:38 yeah yeah i also i would add that it's
1:01:41 not
1:01:42 neither advantage or drawback it's uh
1:01:44 like
1:01:45 it's a good thing but not uh like you
1:01:48 said it's not the thing that will get
1:01:49 you a job right
1:01:52 then gunjan i hope sorry if i uh
1:01:56 pronounce it incorrectly is asking is it
1:01:59 okay to tell recruiters about other
1:02:01 companies you're currently interviewing
1:02:03 with
1:02:04 uh depends on the recruiter
1:02:09 um you know
1:02:14 yeah it depends on the recruiter um
1:02:17 so for example uh like you know
1:02:21 the reason the reason why a lot of
1:02:24 companies do that
1:02:25 is because they want to extract
1:02:27 information
1:02:28 from you to be able to uh
1:02:32 a gauge you know where you're at with
1:02:34 things so for example if you're if
1:02:35 you're interviewing with me
1:02:37 a company that i work with and your
1:02:40 other companies are google amazon
1:02:41 facebook and netflix and you're
1:02:43 interviewing with my company who's got
1:02:46 three people in hamburg uh
1:02:49 what's the likelihood of you taking that
1:02:51 position is probably quite low right
1:02:54 um but on the other side of that
1:02:58 the old-school way of recruitment is
1:03:00 that if you tell me when you're
1:03:01 interviewing
1:03:02 i'll not me personally but i would try
1:03:05 and go and get
1:03:06 those jobs as clients
1:03:09 um so again i think it very much depends
1:03:11 on
1:03:12 the recruiter that you're working with
1:03:14 and how much you trust that individual
1:03:16 if you think he wouldn't do that to me
1:03:19 um
1:03:19 or she wouldn't do that to me then uh
1:03:23 yeah if you've got a good relationship
1:03:24 there then
1:03:25 like there's no reason why you shouldn't
1:03:27 if
1:03:28 you know because then you can kind of
1:03:30 discuss everything and you can kind of
1:03:31 set the
1:03:32 landscape about where you're at with
1:03:34 things and i always believe that being
1:03:35 open and transparent
1:03:36 is the best thing you can do if it's a
1:03:39 new recruiter off the block who's just
1:03:41 called you and said hey
1:03:42 like yeah i've got this job where else
1:03:44 are you interviewing definitely not
1:03:46 the whole recruitment industry is like
1:03:48 shaking their head at me now and
1:03:49 thinking i'm a complete dick
1:03:52 i don't care um
1:03:55 yeah i never thought about this that uh
1:03:57 there are
1:03:59 multiple reasons for asking this
1:04:00 question and also one of these
1:04:02 uh one of the reasons is actually just
1:04:04 going
1:04:05 and approaching the company uh
1:04:08 to offer their services it's interesting
1:04:10 yeah
1:04:13 um how impactful asking salary
1:04:16 uh is in the application uh process like
1:04:18 is it uh
1:04:21 like if somebody is asking a two loan
1:04:23 number does it reflect
1:04:24 lack of confidence or like
1:04:29 lack of confidence in a skill set or
1:04:32 maybe just shows that this candidate
1:04:35 doesn't know maybe
1:04:36 mark it well enough or what do you think
1:04:38 about this like if
1:04:39 somebody's asking or a number too low
1:04:41 too high
1:04:44 um too low you know i've never
1:04:47 as a person i if someone
1:04:50 says to me that they're you know someone
1:04:52 gave me a salary and it's 10k
1:04:54 under kind of whatever classifies market
1:04:56 um right
1:04:57 i've never put that down to confidence
1:04:59 or i i've never
1:05:01 said oh they must be slightly not
1:05:03 confident in their abilities or
1:05:05 something like that
1:05:06 my first go-to is are they they're
1:05:07 underpaid um
1:05:10 so i don't think it's necessarily bad
1:05:16 going too low i don't think that's gonna
1:05:17 happen a negative
1:05:19 um reaction to your job search if you
1:05:22 if you're under the market value um
1:05:26 i guess it depends on how you frame that
1:05:27 right um like if you say oh yeah well
1:05:29 i'm only worth this then yeah that's
1:05:31 going to come down to a confidence issue
1:05:33 um if it just turns out that you work
1:05:35 for a business that has
1:05:37 um you know maybe help like ask you to
1:05:39 relocate into germany and now you're
1:05:41 uh paid less than what you know you know
1:05:44 people
1:05:44 in the country would be paid uh or you
1:05:47 know if you've joined the grad scheme
1:05:48 and you've worked your way up you know
1:05:49 there are going to be lots of different
1:05:50 situations for that
1:05:51 and i don't think i'm kind of into minds
1:05:55 about the salary
1:05:56 thing right now because um originally in
1:05:59 my recruitment career i always wanted to
1:06:01 know what people were on
1:06:03 now i'm a little bit more um mature
1:06:06 and i don't typically
1:06:10 i talk about it but i'm not like you
1:06:12 know i'm not like right what do you earn
1:06:14 right now
1:06:15 um if they want to share that
1:06:17 information with me call but
1:06:18 for me i just want to understand what
1:06:20 they want from their next
1:06:22 you know their next role and their next
1:06:24 salary so
1:06:26 um yeah i don't think it would have a
1:06:27 negative conversation i do think it's a
1:06:29 negative
1:06:30 thing if you ask for too much and
1:06:32 because then
1:06:33 my instant go-to is oh you're that's
1:06:37 you know you're just trying to you know
1:06:40 you're just trying to get
1:06:41 like tons more money and it's that's the
1:06:44 kind of main focus right
1:06:46 um and you know i think in the data
1:06:48 science and machine learning and ai
1:06:50 community right now
1:06:51 there are lots of opportunity for good
1:06:54 people to earn
1:06:55 a lot of money um but if i see someone
1:06:58 who's got six months experience say yeah
1:06:59 cool 120k
1:07:01 then i'm like hey like you know cool but
1:07:04 you're not quite there yet
1:07:06 um so i think it's more negative from
1:07:08 the other side lower
1:07:10 is especially if you're still learning
1:07:12 the industry and
1:07:13 you're still learning the role yeah i
1:07:15 don't think it's a negative thing
1:07:17 at all okay thanks so we don't have
1:07:20 any more questions and we are
1:07:24 a bit over time so just maybe to
1:07:27 summarize our conversation
1:07:28 um what is in your opinion what
1:07:32 makes some candidates really stand out
1:07:37 um so i thought about this for a while
1:07:40 and um the two things that
1:07:45 for me i think there's one one thing
1:07:48 that really makes candlelight stand out
1:07:50 to me
1:07:50 and it's understanding their purpose and
1:07:56 doubling down on that
1:07:57 and i think once you do that everything
1:08:00 else becomes easy
1:08:01 um but i think if you don't have that
1:08:06 and you kind of you're dictated by the
1:08:09 market and you know it's just i'm gonna
1:08:12 get a job here and then hopefully i'll
1:08:13 get one here and
1:08:14 you know it's kind of just a hope that
1:08:17 something happens
1:08:18 you know the candidates that really
1:08:20 stand out or looking back at the people
1:08:22 that i've worked with
1:08:23 the candidates i'm like they are mustard
1:08:25 are the ones that have
1:08:28 worked in one pretty much one industry
1:08:30 but they've just nailed it
1:08:32 and it's kind of just like inch wide
1:08:34 mile deep and that is
1:08:36 that's their focus that's their focus
1:08:37 that's their focus
1:08:39 um so yeah in terms of what i think
1:08:42 makes candidates really stand out is
1:08:44 having
1:08:45 purpose and really working towards that
1:08:48 and that's that yeah thanks thanks for
1:08:52 for for coming to this event for sharing
1:08:54 your uh
1:08:56 knowledge and uh expertise with us
1:08:58 thanks luke
1:09:00 it's a pleasure yeah so how did it feel
1:09:02 being on
1:09:03 the other side uh like being a guest in
1:09:05 a podcast
1:09:07 do you know what i really like i love
1:09:09 the questions
1:09:10 i think it's really good
1:09:14 it's uh yeah i'll be honest it was a bit
1:09:16 nervous because if this is the first
1:09:18 time
1:09:18 we've been a guest right so uh
1:09:20 definitely nerve wracking
1:09:22 um because you know you want to say
1:09:24 stuff that people get
1:09:25 um value from right and you don't want
1:09:28 to come here and say i will
1:09:29 you know make sure that you know your
1:09:31 font is size 10
1:09:33 or some [ __ ] like that you know you want
1:09:35 to make sure that people can
1:09:36 take this sort of stuff and then
1:09:37 actually do it and it actually has
1:09:39 impact so yeah um i hope how do you feel
1:09:43 like it went was that good
1:09:44 i'm not so good yeah i'm still recording
1:09:47 by the way
1:09:48 it's okay it's cool like vulnerability
1:09:51 is a good skill to have i think
