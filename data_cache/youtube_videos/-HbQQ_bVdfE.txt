1:59 your background can you tell us about
2:00 your career Journey so
2:02 far uh what do you mean
2:05 career Journey like how career Journey
2:08 like how you ended up being in the place
2:11 where you are right now what did you do
2:13 before Oh okay fine uh well as you
2:17 learned before I started with marketing
2:19 and actually I was also always focused
2:23 on it I want to uh work in product it
2:27 was my vision of my career but uh to
2:30 start being a product manager or product
2:32 owner you need to start from some
2:34 somewhere so basically it was an
2:36 opportunity to join uh ringa start uh it
2:39 was a s that um provide like analytics
2:43 and uh call tracking uh for marketers
2:47 and basically they had open position of
2:49 marketer uh it was like Performance
2:51 Marketing so I was in charge of doing
2:53 promotions and doing some uh for
2:57 example uh events also and uh my my um
3:05 responsibility was to acquire leads and
3:07 to generate uh leads to to make them our
3:11 customers so uh I did uh for example um
3:15 if very interesting stuff I did I did
3:17 like uh we our customers was B2B users I
3:21 mean uh it's other companies and
3:25 marketting the uh the work for example
3:28 uh e-commerce well and uh that's why we
3:32 did like um I did some interesting
3:34 events for example it was a rating of um
3:39 PPC agencies so that's how I like grab
3:43 attention of all our customers and
3:46 provide something value for them and
3:48 also we for this rating stuff we
3:51 acquired leads so um my first step was
3:55 in Performance Marketing inquiring leads
3:58 and like make making promotions and all
4:01 this like advertising stuff so then I
4:04 went um after ring a start I went to the
4:07 other company um it was like U holding
4:13 logistic holding uh we have like eight
4:16 companies inside this holding they did
4:20 um
4:23 basically it was about uh
4:27 Transportation about uh
4:31 about um also oil we have gas station
4:36 and uh about and they also have
4:39 e-commerce that sell car parts actually
4:43 and I was yeah that's a little bit uh
4:48 some joining for further career and um
4:52 so basically there was a small marketing
4:54 department and we uh also do pretty much
4:57 everything so I also was in charge of
4:59 with Performance Marketing and we did
5:01 some promotions for for each company for
5:04 example we did a promotion for Logistic
5:06 Company made events and so on and uh for
5:10 examp and uh also we was like outsourced
5:14 for internal Outsource marketing for all
5:17 these companies and holding uh and the
5:19 other great task was to make a branding
5:24 for gas stations and I also love this
5:27 task because I was analyzing
5:30 making a job to be done framework uh
5:33 creating great uh messaging in our
5:36 branding and we really this branding
5:39 also and uh and the other task was to to
5:42 launch the websit itself uh car parts we
5:46 were limited in our assortment we just
5:49 sell tires for um actually for and this
5:53 Ecommerce was also B2B because we sell
5:56 to uh logistic companies it was like uh
5:59 stuff for track uh for tracks I mean we
6:01 sell uh batteries for uh huge I mean
6:05 cars I mean this by tracks and um tires
6:09 for them and um oil and all this stuff
6:13 and um I worked there for one year and
6:17 as you know it was based based in
6:19 Ukraine inessa and as you know uh
6:22 actually like in
6:24 20122 uh become a war in Ukraine and
6:28 because I was in marketing
6:30 it become uh and I realized I need to uh
6:34 to move to Europe because of the
6:37 situation there and that's how I left
6:39 the job in Prest company uh because um
6:43 and I actually I was um and I realized I
6:46 was marketing like from internal Market
6:48 in Ukraine and so I would I would need
6:51 to change my whole career to change my
6:55 whole uh what I was doing and to move to
6:58 the other the country and to focus more
7:01 on International position and this was
7:05 where the challenge begins so um I never
7:09 basically had uh really
7:12 uh uh I didn't have experience being a
7:15 product owner I didn't have like much
7:17 experience of e-commerce because my my
7:20 e-commerce was for B2B users it it was
7:22 not about promotion and stuff it was
7:24 small and um I didn't had like much of
7:28 this experience
7:29 and um that's where the Journey about
7:33 breaking like barers in your head and
7:35 for example I see so and I'm I was
7:38 trying to find a new job because um I I
7:41 lost one so uh I did several interviews
7:45 and while I was doing
7:47 interviews
7:48 um I
7:50 actually uh started learning coding uh
7:54 yeah I started learning for example uh
7:57 JavaScript HTML L CSS like while I was
8:01 on this um transition period I I want to
8:04 learn code more and I had really time
8:06 for this to and it was like mindblowing
8:10 for me for the first time it was hard
8:12 and I was like uh
8:15 um I really struggle to to learn how to
8:19 code and basically I end up I can like
8:22 for example a code a website for example
8:25 so um I use this time I was looking for
8:29 a new job I L this time for Learning and
8:31 new stuff and uh the hard stuff for me
8:34 because it's completely different what I
8:36 did before so basically how I join out
8:39 do it's a great story um I just tried
8:43 different channels how to to find a new
8:46 job and um I wrote my um colleague that
8:50 we used uh to work in ringer stad and I
8:53 just wrote him like how you doing how
8:55 you doing with this whole situation in
8:57 Ukraine where you are right now and he
8:59 said I'm working in out do right now so
9:03 um and I ask yeah actually I'm looking
9:05 for job maybe you have some open
9:06 position guys and yeah and he said yeah
9:10 why not I should ask people and um the
9:14 recor sent me a job description and it
9:17 was like nothing with uh nothing
9:20 actually with my um knowledge and was so
9:24 different and I was so B the product
9:26 owner position right yeah yeah the
9:27 product owner position and
9:29 uh the requirements was so uh like to be
9:33 a product owner in e-commerce for two
9:35 years and to know about car parts a lot
9:38 and everything like this but you knew
9:40 something about car parts already from
9:42 your Logistics experience so it was
9:45 still a match to some extent right uh
9:47 yeah that's I use this experience to
9:50 sell myself for example yeah to be more
9:52 relevant that I am uh so
9:56 um and um we went on some interviews and
10:01 I think um they liked me and uh so
10:06 that's how I joined outad do and that's
10:11 U and from beginning in out do I can
10:14 share like my challenges how you um
10:17 transform in your position
10:20 from yeah I definitely have questions
10:22 about that yeah okay I'm just curious uh
10:25 like when the war started you left
10:28 Ukraine did you go immediately to Berlin
10:31 or we went um it was hard to find a
10:35 apartment actually yeah you know maybe
10:37 this and um we started from small town
10:42 in Germany and then I realized um it's
10:46 so small to live there so we went to Rav
10:50 and uh from RAV uh I then I moved to
10:54 Berlin but I moved to Berlin already
10:56 being an employee of arox ah so you have
10:59 offices in both Roso and Berlin we don't
11:02 have offices in Roso we just it's remote
11:06 aha okay so you lived in Roso you
11:08 contacted your ex- colleague from one of
11:10 the previous companies and he forwarded
11:13 you a job description like you didn't
11:16 really fit this job description you
11:17 still Tred to interview and then you got
11:19 this job and then you eventually moved
11:21 to yeah yes that's true okay yeah I
11:25 think I interrupted you because you
11:27 wanted to tell us about the challenges
11:30 right uh like because your experience
11:32 your prior experience was about
11:34 Performance Marketing yeah You' been
11:37 talking about things like PPC campaigns
11:39 which is yeah what what does it mean
11:42 actually PPC paper click paper click
11:44 exactly yeah and now you're a product
11:47 owner right which is I don't know how
11:50 related it is to Pro to Performance
11:52 Marketing maybe there is some relation
11:54 maybe not but yeah I'm
11:56 curious like so what what were the
11:59 challenges like how did you actually
12:02 transition and what did you need to do
12:04 for this uh yeah that's interesting part
12:08 and uh the first challenges H is I need
12:13 to learn a lot yeah and um and I spent
12:18 like uh I work a lot and I like work
12:23 like late late uh evening to to be an
12:28 expert this um field and uh I learned
12:33 from very different perspectives uh for
12:35 example first I need to learn what the
12:38 prodct ownership is and I went to some
12:41 bunch of courses for example there was
12:44 um special course for uh product
12:46 ownership in Ukraine I want to to Deep
12:49 dive in this position uh in this role
12:52 actually what does it means and but you
12:55 were already employed so you already got
12:57 hired and you thought okay like what
12:58 this product owner thing is actually
13:03 right yeah yeah that's that's a funny
13:06 part but uh I really um did a lot to to
13:10 learn and I read so much books and for
13:13 example there is a book um professional
13:15 product owner and it describe uh what
13:18 the role of product owner is basically
13:20 the product owner is role on in scrum uh
13:23 so but in our company a product owner
13:26 it's more product manager be it's just
13:29 title but we do pretty much uh all the
13:32 product manager does and now we on um uh
13:36 now we are
13:38 um uh Tech transformation and our titles
13:42 would be product managers actually um so
13:45 yeah and I really the first what I did
13:48 is I deep dive uh what the product owner
13:52 uh role and what this person does so I
13:56 went to courses I went reading books and
13:59 I read a lot of mat of this and
14:01 basically I did have like previous uh
14:03 for example um I have some knowledge how
14:07 for example in my previous companies
14:08 people were doing same thing for example
14:12 in ring start we had uh pretty much the
14:15 same positions um it was Visionary
14:19 officer we had and project manager and
14:22 basically this uh I I I grab some
14:26 patterns from from those people and put
14:29 those patterns when I was uh doing this
14:31 role so and and then I really deep dive
14:36 um um more in this role then I'm um then
14:40 the second Challenge and um what I want
14:44 to say like uh when you're transitioning
14:46 from other from the other position what
14:49 would be super helpful for you uh it's
14:52 to build connection with your colleagues
14:54 and uh your
14:55 co-workers um because those people will
14:59 help you and they will teach you for
15:02 example and
15:04 um and it's not uh and actually like my
15:08 tip for this it's learn from everyone
15:11 and I learned from uh quity Assurance
15:14 Engineers a lot they they learning me
15:17 about the product I learned from
15:18 Engineers a lot they they learn me the
15:20 logic of the product of the search and I
15:22 learned from uh business analysts and I
15:27 learned a lot from data analysts and uh
15:30 I communicate with CR cross functional
15:33 team and I spend really really quality
15:36 time like in onetoone meetings to to
15:39 Really to First build connections and to
15:44 learn from them and to deeply understand
15:47 the product so um and I uh and given um
15:52 a tip for myself uh back when I started
15:57 um it's do more communication do do more
16:00 uh one to on and communicate uh for
16:03 example with different people with
16:05 different levels uh and they all will
16:07 generate you insights um how to make
16:11 your how to be more insightful and more
16:15 productive and more and learn like
16:18 internal stuff in a company to
16:20 understand the context
16:22 so uh the second yeah
16:27 um what else need to share so basically
16:30 uh about my uh how I learn data for
16:34 example data analy I'm curious about a
16:38 few things so like you so you mentioned
16:41 you had two problems so the first
16:43 problem that you needed to learn a lot M
16:46 and what you did um you took courses you
16:50 worked um late evenings so you try to
16:53 immerse yourself in the job to learn as
16:56 much as possible and then the second
16:58 thing think uh was building connections
17:01 and you would speak with pretty much
17:03 everyone in the company to learn from
17:05 them how they work what they work on
17:07 what kind of problems they have and also
17:10 learn about the
17:11 company and I think this thing this
17:13 communication this one of one one
17:15 meetings are really important for
17:18 everyone regardless of the role like be
17:20 it product manager product owner data
17:22 scientist I know software engineer
17:25 anyone so I'm just curious like for this
17:28 oneone meetings let's say you want to
17:30 speak with QA engineer or business
17:33 analyst or data analyst like how do you
17:36 structure this meeting so first I guess
17:38 you need to approach a person saying
17:41 like hey Martin or hey Teresa I want to
17:44 have a one-on-one meeting with you right
17:46 so you agree on a meeting but then what
17:48 happens next like how do you structure
17:50 this meeting how do you take most of
17:52 this meeting or it's just free form or
17:54 you have some structure yeah yeah I I'm
17:57 I want to like share specific case uh
18:00 for
18:01 example while I was because I joined
18:05 they already have like uh development
18:07 going on they have specific feature to
18:09 deliver and um it and basically uh I
18:15 realize that we have kind of
18:17 miscommunication with one developer we
18:20 just don't uh hear each other I was uh I
18:23 was understanding that um we cannot find
18:28 common language I'm saying one thing
18:30 he's saying another and that's uh and we
18:34 were losing time and uh for example we
18:38 do Communications in G G jir and U just
18:43 didn't is the communication wasn't
18:45 aligned so I decided to make this
18:47 onetoone meeting to to fix the situation
18:50 to to find a Common Language with the
18:52 developer right with a developer right
18:55 and uh so the structure was like this uh
18:59 um uh I will try to remember the
19:02 question I asked him for example I asked
19:05 him uh what is his vision of product
19:09 owner the best like product owner what
19:11 he expect from me to be the product
19:14 owner and uh the second question was who
19:17 he consider to be the best product owner
19:19 in the company and uh he described me
19:23 like uh what what he expect from me and
19:27 he he described me what is a great
19:29 product owner in already in our company
19:32 uh who I need for example to to learn
19:35 from for example and uh what I learned
19:38 from him he want a product owner to be
19:41 more confident and more like uh pushy
19:45 just to to be a leader uh and that's he
19:49 said he's lacking for me and this was a
19:52 great feedback like people need person
19:55 who would uh in product own devel see
19:58 the person who will like be a great
20:00 leader and
20:03 um and we were talking uh also we were
20:06 talking about like small talks we talk
20:08 about things like outside of the job uh
20:13 I um actually learned that he loved
20:16 tennis and actually actually I also play
20:19 tennis and we have a small talk about
20:21 tennis you connected on this
20:25 basis sorry like you connected cuz you
20:27 have you share the same
20:30 Hobby Connection you know well um and
20:33 just you know and I was asking him like
20:37 give me some tips how to improve my job
20:39 and what can I do and he shared his
20:42 opinion and how we can improve our for
20:45 example uh work process what do you
20:48 think is uh what do you think are our
20:51 gaps and this I just want I just wanted
20:54 to collect his feedback and and I showed
20:57 him and this feedback was really
20:59 important for me naturally and I really
21:02 want him to just to share his concerns
21:05 and everything and after all uh after
21:08 this meeting uh this person said yeah
21:11 okay I I understand you and he wasn't
21:14 Angry Anymore he understand like I came
21:16 I'm new be and um he said okay you will
21:20 learn okay Valerie I'm fine with you
21:22 it's okay so and that's for how when one
21:26 hour you can do the connection and
21:30 um um yeah and if you and that's how you
21:35 for example step by step you become a
21:38 better uh specialist more mature more
21:42 confident uh and you learn more and now
21:45 comparing me with that person in the
21:48 beginning is two different
21:52 people and uh you said so you wanted you
21:55 needed to find a Common Language with
21:57 the developer and you couldn't find it
22:00 and maybe it's more like a step back
22:02 question cuz we did not really discuss
22:04 what product owners do so I was
22:07 wondering like why was it important to
22:10 have good communication with this
22:12 developer like what's uh what's the role
22:15 of product owner so what yeah yeah we we
22:18 didn't discuss this you said you took a
22:20 lot of courses to figure out what your
22:22 job actually is so yeah what is your
22:26 job funny one uh yeah um it's uh the
22:31 funny thing is um how product uh owners
22:35 are considered to be in the literature
22:38 yeah and how it's in real life so I
22:40 think it's kind of different and I will
22:42 share you um some what's the real
22:46 reality is um so the first in e-commerce
22:50 actually so basically as I um said
22:54 before I'm in charge of of search um
22:57 it's when you type something and
22:58 searching in e-commerce and basically um
23:02 the one part is um it's um monitoring
23:06 the metrix so basically I'm in charge
23:09 of uh keeping eye on a product so
23:12 basically of existing products for we
23:15 are uh like e-commerce we already have
23:18 uh our search working and first I need
23:20 to do and it's monitor how we uh our
23:24 day-to-day metrics uh do we have our
23:27 conversion rate our like what is search
23:29 popularity and all this stuff
23:32 so uh and um this is one of part of uh
23:37 my job and if you have some like
23:39 critical box I need to um fix it somehow
23:44 to find developer just uh uh not make
23:47 company lose money and uh and I I'm in
23:52 charge to to make the functionality
23:53 works fine and sometimes we we do have
23:56 some issues for example always updating
23:59 products and uh and I also need to
24:03 control this that's the one part the
24:05 other part is the real product owner
24:08 part product manager part is you need to
24:11 have a Clear Vision where you going
24:13 where you product going uh you need to
24:15 have like a detailed road map with those
24:19 gics and um and user stories and
24:23 priortize like product owner prioritize
24:26 um product owner is value maximizer this
24:29 person need to prioritize the most
24:33 valuable features uh and say we do we
24:37 doing this first in uh next features
24:40 would be these ones uh so uh basically
24:43 Road mapping planning uh defining the
24:47 vision is the product and the strategy
24:50 basically is the product owner uh
24:53 role
24:54 um the other things uh uh I need to do
24:59 is basically team management and uh
25:03 basically I I think I can say that I uh
25:07 sometimes I do the role of scrum master
25:09 or project manager it's how you just
25:14 organize the work uh to to deliver some
25:17 uh features and uh FR frankly say we
25:21 don't have like
25:25 uh Unstoppable development what I want
25:28 to say we have some initiatives we we
25:30 deliver and uh for example of in this
25:33 year I was uh within like there was some
25:36 time we didn't like actively work on
25:39 search because the company had different
25:41 initiatives for example migrating from
25:44 um Regular website to Adaptive websites
25:47 and I was taking the road for
25:49 transitioning uh existing website to
25:51 Adaptive website and I didn't like
25:54 participate as a scrum master in this
25:56 kind of initiative I was uh doing the
25:58 different role so but sometimes we have
26:02 very dedicated to search uh initiatives
26:04 for example deliver fit filters or new
26:06 how to complete and um for this kind of
26:10 part I do the role of uh scrub Master to
26:13 organize our um basically our
26:17 development process and
26:20 uh I also do this kind of stuff um I was
26:24 mentioning uh during the road mapping
26:28 but I didn't mention um I I do pretty
26:31 much research as well so basically our
26:34 uh monitor competitors I do read a lot
26:37 of about search actually like um I was
26:40 actually very surprised the search is
26:43 such a deep deep um topic uh it's like
26:46 you need to know about machine learning
26:48 natural processing uh you need to know
26:50 about algorithms about elastic search
26:53 and how to do the a to complete you need
26:56 to know about uh product structure and
27:00 um all the attributes how the search is
27:02 and also you need to to know the users
27:05 actually uh like what's the business
27:08 context of search what problems are
27:11 using users trying to solve while they
27:13 searching for car parts for example and
27:15 you need to know like different uh quir
27:18 types for example users can search
27:20 different ways they can search by uh
27:23 part numbers like OEM numbers or uh they
27:26 can search by name or just they just
27:30 type like I want to break pods Brembo on
27:33 my Audi I4 and you need to know how to
27:37 make your search understand all the
27:38 semantics
27:41 so um yeah so basically yeah that's
27:44 pretty you've been talking for 10
27:46 minutes and I realized I'm taking notes
27:48 and it's like the entire page with what
27:51 you do yeah I'm jumping a lot but uh I
27:54 think um I want to structure a little
27:56 bit first first is like monitor how the
27:59 things are going right now on the
28:01 current project uh second you need to do
28:05 for example research and understand
28:08 users and understand
28:11 um understand users understand
28:13 competitors and um understand like
28:18 patterns of user searching and the the
28:20 other part is um basically Team
28:24 Management how
28:25 to uh how to organiz work
28:29 and yeah you follow scrum right and like
28:33 all this uh I don't know estimating
28:36 estimating meetings uh daily standups uh
28:42 retrospectives you organiz all that
28:44 right uh
28:46 yes depending on initiatives we have for
28:49 example uh if for example
28:53 we if we for example have to deliver
28:57 filters we need like uh two developers
29:01 one Q two Q engineers and uh and pretty
29:05 much uh that's said and so uh yeah for
29:10 this kind of uh development
29:13 process for example we did like uh
29:16 standups and planning and retrospective
29:20 but uh uh for the other initiative like
29:24 we need to investigate new technologies
29:26 you don't really
29:28 all this um ceremonies so it's
29:32 basically you just um do pretty much
29:36 more Canan when it's like uh do need to
29:40 be done in progress done so um for
29:43 different initiatives different types of
29:46 uh so from what I understood you work
29:48 with multiple teams right uh yeah that's
29:51 the the the interesting part because
29:55 um uh right now we don't really have
29:57 super dedicated search team and but I'm
30:01 um looking forward we to have one like
30:04 uh and it used before we just have uh we
30:09 took like Developers for some uh kind of
30:12 like initiatives for example for for
30:14 some kind of initiative you mean uh you
30:16 just grab some people you you know to
30:19 deliver this feature you need those
30:20 people and you acquire those people and
30:23 you have this initiative and you deliver
30:26 it and and uh but we are going to have
30:30 like dedicated teams for example
30:32 dedicated to search because um now our
30:35 in our road map we have like natureal
30:38 language processing we have um machine
30:40 learning and uh I think it's uh requires
30:44 a lot a lot of context understanding um
30:48 and that's why I I try to to form a team
30:52 uh around
30:53 search okay so right now one of the
30:56 things in addition to all these things
30:58 you mentioned you're also building a
30:59 search team yeah okay so I just want to
31:03 summarize uh what you said so first
31:06 thing you monitor Business Health search
31:09 health if I can say this um
31:11 yeah the you're right check and second
31:16 thing is you're doing research you're
31:18 talking with users you're watching what
31:20 competitors are doing so then you know
31:22 like if you need any features new
31:24 features or things like that then you do
31:27 this uh Team operational stuff which is
31:30 like scran compan all this processes and
31:33 rituals then you mentioned uh more like
31:36 strategic part or I don't know like
31:39 defining the Clear Vision of where
31:41 you're going and then also from that
31:44 vision building a road map that's
31:46 another thing and then I remember you
31:49 talked about actually learning all these
31:51 things learning about NLP learning about
31:53 machine learning um and now I think I
31:57 understood because you need to build a
31:59 team and you want to know what kind of
32:02 um things they need to know right like
32:06 what kind of
32:08 U what kind of experience we need in the
32:10 team what kind of knowledge we need in
32:12 the team right so you need to know that
32:14 in order to build the team yeah for
32:16 example I I need to know for example
32:18 natural language processing is data
32:19 science stuff and I understand uh
32:23 actually I have um it's not just me uh
32:28 you might have an expression that I do
32:30 all the stuff and it's like T sh person
32:33 but we still have for example a research
32:35 team that also um like inside in our dog
32:40 there is like research team research
32:42 department and they pretty do much like
32:45 in-depth analytics and all this stuff so
32:47 I don't do it by myself actually I don't
32:50 do uh user interviews as you said we
32:53 have like special department for that
32:55 and also we have for examp to know right
32:58 you still need to know that there was
33:00 this interview and this is the outcome
33:01 of this interview this were the
33:03 questions and perhaps you even watch the
33:05 videos of the interview to see how users
33:07 actually use the app and then they see
33:09 okay something is wrong here maybe we
33:11 should change the FL yeah it's true yeah
33:15 my message was I didn't do it by myself
33:17 but we have like a a special department
33:20 for this and but I still like need to be
33:23 um to read this for example uh St
33:26 studies and just like you don't code
33:29 yourself right but you need to translate
33:32 what researchers found to what actually
33:35 needs to done to be done to happen and
33:37 then here this glue that kind of links
33:41 these departments
33:44 right uh yeah so um I call being product
33:48 manager is like mini CEO of the product
33:51 it's you know maybe you heard this and
33:52 that's true you're like responsible for
33:55 everything and uh and if you have some
33:58 some kind of issues with your product so
34:00 you need to react and that's a trick PR
34:05 I know but still it's very interesting
34:07 it's for some people who like this
34:09 because I think I like more generalist
34:12 and t-shaped person and I like to to for
34:15 example to uh learn from different
34:18 perspectives so I think uh this is fine
34:21 for me to not be in like a super
34:25 um narrow specialist but be more wide uh
34:31 person how do you keep up with all that
34:34 cuz like you mentioned like in addition
34:36 to all that you also need to learn about
34:39 all this machine learning stuff and
34:42 actually this is how I found you so
34:44 there was a post that you made about
34:47 relevant Search the book and Duke the
34:50 author uh he liked the post and it
34:54 appeared in my feet cuz Duke was already
34:56 a guest multiple times in
34:58 dat and then I saw his reaction and then
35:01 I read the post and I thought H
35:02 interesting I should invite Valeria and
35:06 yeah so why did you so the book is uh
35:09 the book is called relevant search and
35:11 as far as I remember the book is about
35:13 it's a very technical book it's about
35:15 ustic search for it's elastic search
35:18 right a search engine for building like
35:22 search um so how how did you come across
35:25 this book and why did you decide to read
35:26 it
35:28 yeah I think it's good to mention uh
35:31 because I want to
35:34 be because yeah just a second I I see
35:38 that I need to be I need to understand
35:41 all the stuff and to to communicate with
35:45 Developers for example and I I was in
35:48 some communities of elastic and I see
35:50 like people were sharing this book and
35:52 actually this book is promoted to be a
35:54 good V like a Bible of search or
35:57 something yeah so and I found it's um
36:01 it's pretty useful to to read about
36:03 search and why I wrote this post because
36:06 um you know they in a introduction of
36:08 this book they like um just pointed some
36:12 my pain points um they just described
36:16 importance of search and how hard the
36:19 search is and um the the main point is
36:25 uh relevance is um it's very connected
36:29 to business context and uh and you need
36:32 to educate developers to understand
36:34 business context because for uh you
36:38 cannot just just uh build a relevant
36:40 search from scratch you need to tune the
36:42 search to be relevant and you need to
36:45 give the developers this context uh what
36:48 is relevant for users for example and um
36:53 and I really really like this uh thought
36:56 like this expression uh that's uh it's
36:59 not and we need to work on relevance uh
37:03 it's not you cannot just grab some
37:06 Universal search and it would be super
37:09 fine you need to tune it for your
37:12 business and uh that's when I want
37:15 posted um on LinkedIn this uh thought I
37:20 really liked and um the second part of
37:22 the the the post was about cross
37:25 function collaboration
37:27 uh so it's not about like requirement
37:30 driven development it's more about like
37:32 product mindset uh like everyone should
37:35 understand as I said the B business
37:37 context and why it's important for users
37:41 to get this kind of results and um I
37:45 would I expect my developers to deep
37:49 understanding of business context uh and
37:51 I'm also and I'm creating actually those
37:53 meetings where I'm trying to explain
37:57 developers uh why we're doing this like
38:00 uh what the problems of user we're
38:02 solving and for example what the search
38:04 actually means and for example even
38:07 today I will have this meeting uh and I
38:09 um I would show them for example the
38:11 user can search by catalog so they can
38:14 navigate by catalog but but the search
38:16 is a different part um it's a different
38:18 way uh to search for car parts uh by by
38:23 text so and I I want them to understand
38:25 this that we it's not about just text
38:28 it's it's about users solving their
38:31 problems um CU I imagine um if we talk
38:35 about this domain of car parts it's a
38:37 pretty complex one it's like let's say
38:40 you have a specific car model make right
38:43 I don't know Volkswagen I'm not really
38:45 into cars I don't know some specific
38:47 model right it's okay it's fine and then
38:49 you need a specific part that would fit
38:51 this exact car right and then like you
38:54 not only need to know like the name name
38:56 of this car part but also like the model
38:59 and make of the car for which you need
39:01 the the part and then I can imagine that
39:04 it becomes pretty complex at some point
39:06 right um well for this point we have
39:10 this kind of either Journey user need to
39:13 uh for example we have this cool feature
39:16 you you just need to insert your driver
39:19 uh you plate license
39:21 plate and uh the our like vehicle
39:25 selector will identify the the vle by
39:29 this uh uh license plate and uh for some
39:33 countries we have this feature and I
39:35 think it's super uh user friendly you
39:38 just type six point uh six points and
39:41 now when your car is identified in our
39:44 like website uh you can just search for
39:47 stuff and you will have only um car
39:51 parts fitable to your car so it's work
39:55 like this um you first identify your car
39:59 and then you can search for uh stuff and
40:02 this would
40:03 be that that that products that our
40:07 website is showing you they are fit for
40:09 your
40:10 car okay well you you need to have this
40:13 business context you need to know this
40:14 business context in order to arrive at
40:17 this solution right without it you would
40:20 come up with I don't know just a general
40:21 search bar and you will be I don't
40:24 know compressor I don't know if there's
40:27 such a I know that there are compressors
40:29 and fridges like whatever part name for
40:33 whatever model right and then okay why
40:35 it's not working why it's showing me
40:38 this part for another Volkswagen
40:41 right yeah we actually uh really in
40:45 right now in out do we still have some
40:48 um like gaps and but it's a road map to
40:53 fill this gap for example you can for
40:55 example you can
40:57 uh buy product without actually um
41:01 identifying the car yeah you can do it
41:03 right now and it's our like uh task to
41:09 solve uh to to make it's more user
41:12 friendly to to to provide users ability
41:16 to make we need to make a website
41:21 to make it more clear uh understand you
41:26 user need to pick a card to to find the
41:29 right one for the user because user
41:32 actually can uh it's it's a quite common
41:35 pattern that you can us can search for
41:38 example a car part for example a brake
41:40 disc for Audi and that's it like it's
41:44 not specifying which Audi so and uh we
41:48 need to uh and we actually we now are
41:53 making machine learning uh feature with
41:55 natural Lang processing that will uh
41:59 identify in a search quiry the car part
42:02 maker or model and uh offer user to give
42:07 more information about the C to to make
42:09 uh um the whole journey the whole I mean
42:13 information about the car
42:15 so we have this feature in
42:18 development just quite a technical
42:20 feature it includes like knowing what
42:24 natural language processing is what
42:26 parsing is extracting things from there
42:29 like how technical you need to be like
42:30 how much you as a product owner need to
42:33 know about that is it more like nice to
42:35 have or in your case it's actually a
42:37 very important
42:39 skill uh yeah I actually went also to uh
42:43 you know maybe you know this conferences
42:46 about search H Tech and is it also in
42:49 Berlin yeah it's in Berlin and it's
42:53 really technical um conference
42:57 is it's like for developers and I also
42:59 go there to to understand the technical
43:03 aspect and
43:05 um you know what helps chat GPT helps a
43:08 lot actually what I do it's like for
43:11 example I'm reading this technical book
43:13 and I don't really understand what
43:15 information tal is and uh I just go to
43:18 chat GPT and say hey jpt what is
43:21 information retrival in context of cart
43:24 search and uh ah inverted index not
43:27 information inverted index for example
43:30 and what this means inverted index in
43:33 context of car part search and I the
43:36 chat G and explain me like five I'm just
43:39 kidding that's a very important part
43:42 right yeah yeah so just do a simple
43:46 explanation and chat GPT gives me like
43:49 very simple uh
43:51 with examples I can understand so uh
43:55 that's the cool part and I think like
43:57 Yeah the more you technical person is
43:59 the better and but I don't know uh and
44:03 I'm trying to deep uh into technical
44:05 stuff I really um try to understand
44:09 what's natural uh natural uh language
44:13 processing is and uh from a technical
44:16 part but uh uh I I I think the more you
44:20 in Tech the better but still uh the
44:23 basics help you to communicate with
44:25 people and and to give them a
44:29 context and for General understanding
44:32 but for example I need to know what's
44:33 actually natural Pro uh natural language
44:36 processing task does and I know it's
44:38 like spelling correction I know it's
44:41 like named entity recognition so you um
44:45 um the natural processing makes the teiz
44:47 of the quiry like this it's like um
44:50 brand name or it's a car part name or
44:53 its number uh this St call do the menal
44:57 language processing so yeah I I think uh
45:01 mandatory to learn Basics but the better
45:04 you know you earn attx the better
45:07 and okay and I guess uh it also depends
45:11 on the area where you work so since you
45:13 work in e-commerce search so for you it
45:15 makes sense to go and learn about search
45:17 if somebody works in some other domain
45:19 right so maybe for them um they would
45:22 need to learn about some other things
45:24 but it's still for a product owner it's
45:27 important to know the
45:29 technical part
45:31 of like I'm just trying to think of an
45:33 example let's say there can be a product
45:36 owner in the moderation team and
45:38 moderation team uses machine learning to
45:41 identify things that shouldn't be posted
45:43 on the website and so for them probably
45:45 it's important to know how machine
45:48 learning can be used for this and what
45:50 machine learning actually is Right
45:52 similar to your
45:54 case mhm
45:56 and you mentioned you found this book
46:00 when you were in a search community so
46:03 you already part of technical search
46:05 communities and you came across this
46:08 book uh yeah there is in telegram they
46:11 have like elastic search group and I am
46:15 part of this group and because actually
46:17 we're always looking for to developers
46:20 and that's why and there people sharing
46:24 and that's how I learned
46:26 and also on GitHub I also see like bunch
46:29 of books about elastic search and this
46:31 book was first so um that's how I uh
46:36 realized I really need to read this one
46:38 because so much Social proof on
46:41 it yeah okay so you said you're looking
46:45 for developers right
46:46 now yeah we do so what's the profile
46:50 that you're looking for you mentioned
46:52 it's a fully remote position right cuz I
46:55 heard in our community in data do Club
46:58 many people say hey like I really want
47:00 to have like a full remote job but it's
47:02 always us-based or Us remote remote
47:05 within us uh so what kind of remote or
47:09 it's not
47:10 remote uh for example we have uh offices
47:14 across Europe across Ukraine for example
47:16 and even in other countries and if you
47:18 live in the city you can go to office
47:20 it's it's a fine like uh we we do have
47:24 office in Berlin we have uh our Tech Hub
47:27 actually is lbone and uh this the
47:31 previous week I've been there on a
47:33 product event um and it's like you can
47:37 work remote but also you can go to
47:39 office it's not if you're in the
47:42 city but you lived in rotow and you
47:44 worked remotely right it's also yeah
47:46 yeah and um what I did uh actually I
47:51 invest I think in uh traveling around uh
47:55 Europe and see people offline and
47:59 connect with
48:00 them because I think it's crucial to to
48:04 also make this offline
48:07 connections uh so I pretty much been in
48:10 um in some offices in know
48:14 already well please share the links to
48:17 the job descriptions maybe there's
48:19 somebody who is like an experienced
48:20 search engineer who is listening to us
48:22 right now yeah yeah why not would love
48:25 to join your
48:28 team okay I see that we have some
48:31 questions
48:33 um um so the question is maybe we
48:36 already answered that did you have the
48:37 scrum Master experience and project man
48:40 manager experience before this job or
48:42 you picked it up on the job and learned
48:45 as you go yeah I learned as you go but I
48:48 as I mentioned before I had great
48:50 pattern we have in Rat we have great
48:54 project manager she was also a scrum
48:56 master and uh I know all the um before
49:03 coming I know all about scrum ceremonies
49:06 uh all about U and I see how people did
49:11 stand ups how people do retrospectives
49:13 how they did uh um planning and I've
49:18 seen it and I have great patterns how it
49:21 uh how it can be done and so what I did
49:24 I just read the scrum guide and uh I
49:29 went also to scrum uh training actually
49:34 and uh and practically you just and I
49:37 know like the theoretic uh part of this
49:41 and uh I triy to make it just uh on flly
49:46 how you say and you just need to be a
49:48 great talker I think and if you know the
49:51 basics you just need to to be a great um
49:55 public public speaker for this Ro
49:57 because you
49:58 always I need
50:03 to you always need to keep your uh guys
50:09 motivated and involved in the project
50:12 and you do it by being this person being
50:15 this energetic person being this like
50:17 servant leader uh so yeah you learn the
50:20 basics and then
50:22 you and I I so so basically to Su up I
50:26 have previous um uh experience like how
50:30 people did it and I see it how it worked
50:33 and then I read uh I read the book about
50:36 scrum actually like not even the scrum
50:39 guide I went to uh scrum training and
50:44 and I just started to to do it
50:48 like but for me the most interesting
50:50 part is that
50:53 they decided to hire you even though you
50:56 had no experience in these areas which
50:59 probably means that maybe being an
51:01 experienced scrum Master is not
51:02 important because you can and you're Liv
51:04 in proof of that you can pick up the
51:07 skill on the job but do you know like
51:09 what they actually looked at when
51:11 deciding to hire you like what kind of
51:13 skills they were interested in when
51:17 making this decision um I think
51:19 historically now to dog people actually
51:22 yeah this the point is uh historically
51:25 out dog people uh in a product ownership
51:28 uh position came from marketing uh it
51:31 was a structure and so my boss she's
51:33 also came from marketing and her boss
51:36 came from marketing so that's why uh
51:38 those people uh was always marketing the
51:41 ground and they know like it's okay to
51:45 transform from marketing to product
51:47 ownership so uh probably if we had um
51:51 product owners come from developers they
51:53 would never actually hired me because
51:55 they would be biased about me so I think
51:59 that's uh that's played a lot because um
52:03 because historically product owners in
52:06 outdo came from
52:08 marketing and which skills that you
52:10 already had from the marketing past
52:14 helped you in your current
52:16 role yeah the first one uh is actually
52:21 um understanding um I think what common
52:26 in marketing and product management it's
52:29 understanding the user for example um
52:31 doing job to down Frameworks uh
52:34 understanding customer Journeys uh
52:37 understanding customer like Spain's Gaye
52:39 customer needs uh and all this about
52:42 customer development stuff it's also
52:45 there is in marketing and there is in
52:47 product so basically this kind of
52:50 knowledge I already had and uh it's cool
52:54 um so the second one it's um I want to
52:58 share this it's very interesting uh when
53:00 you work in a super huge company like in
53:03 uh aod do we have 3,000 people uh and
53:09 it's not the same that's working in
53:10 small startup uh what the difference is
53:13 is people don't know you and people
53:16 don't know if and people don't know
53:18 about your product as well so I think
53:20 the crucial role in a big of a product
53:23 manager in a big company is to
53:27 um be a PR manager of your product be um
53:33 marketer of your product internal
53:35 marketer to to um make people learn
53:39 about your product about benefits of
53:42 your product and um that there is a
53:45 search in the company and who's
53:47 responsible for the search and because
53:50 in small company everybody knows and
53:52 everybody it's like obvious but in in a
53:54 huge super huge company it's not obvious
53:56 and you just need to be you just need to
53:59 to shine uh for example that's why I
54:02 post on LinkedIn that's why I uh travel
54:06 to communicate with other people and uh
54:09 because um when it becomes a huge
54:12 company you need to to scale uh yourself
54:16 your your brand awareness uh and
54:19 awareness of your project so that's
54:21 where marketing helps me uh because I
54:24 used like social media to actually um
54:28 talk about the search and uh use this
54:32 techniques to
54:36 to uh to to to educate people about my
54:39 product actually uh because and we all
54:43 working remotely so the
54:46 information
54:48 uh like we a little bit isolated so um
54:53 for me like LinkedIn post it's like a
54:56 virtual version of communication in
55:00 office um and that's why you post self
55:03 right yeah it's kind of my trick like I
55:07 I understand the uh the importance so uh
55:11 across big company you need to to talk
55:14 more about your product uh publicly
55:17 because um the otherwise
55:22 uh and that generates like example
55:25 people from ass assortment coming to me
55:28 to solve this uh ass certain problems
55:31 and like it's uh generate new
55:33 connections and new ideas and that's why
55:37 I think uh it's kind of uh crucial to to
55:40 to grow in a big company you need to be
55:43 like a little bit more about uh little
55:46 bit uh PR manager of yourself and of
55:50 your uh product and of your team as well
55:53 that's how your marketing skills help
55:56 knew how to Market something so okay
55:59 let's think what I can do to be more
56:02 noticeable within the company right uh
56:05 yeah let's run a PPC
56:08 campaign I'm just kidding and there the
56:11 other one I wanted to add and you also
56:13 need to sell your ideas for example
56:15 because when the company is huge and
56:18 there is so much
56:20 initiatives uh and like top management
56:23 need to pick some more uh the most
56:28 initiative that will generate more uh
56:31 Revenue right and um because how the
56:35 prioritization works and uh sometimes
56:38 you don't really know how this feature
56:41 will deliver uh money in future just is
56:44 selling the future and I see for for for
56:47 project management you for product
56:49 management you need to be a great uh
56:51 salesperson you need to encourage to
56:55 believe in this perfect future like it
56:56 will generate revenue and stuff because
56:59 you just can um pro pro um
57:05 uh you you're right you're selling the
57:07 future so it's not uh sometimes obvious
57:10 what would be outcome of this feature uh
57:13 so that's also like pres making
57:16 presentations this helps uh I I took it
57:19 from marketing um make uh
57:23 understanding uh what the information
57:25 should be shown uh what how can you
57:28 encourage people to to listen to you to
57:31 listen to your new idea so basically uh
57:35 make a pitch right so uh and it's it's
57:39 all about marketing uh how you make a
57:41 pitch and because uh it's and for me
57:45 it's the same that I was working in uh
57:48 B2B marketing it's how we pitched our
57:50 product to the B2B users and we just
57:54 have this present presentation and
57:55 describing what the benefits of this
57:57 product is the same thing I do in a
57:59 company I uh tell um what benefits from
58:03 from my product
58:05 yeah yeah thanks that's a very
58:08 comprehensive answer so I see that we
58:10 are almost running of time and still
58:13 wanted to ask you one thing is you you
58:16 tell you told us that you needed to
58:19 learn a lot and you took a lot of
58:20 courses a you read a lot of books so
58:23 already we talked about one book
58:25 relevant search are there any other
58:29 resources that you would recommend to
58:31 the listeners who want to learn more
58:33 about product ownership in this
58:35 topic actually uh it it's what it
58:40 wouldn't be like typical answer but I
58:43 think uh The crucial after all I talk on
58:47 this meeting uh on this like interview
58:50 for me the the most like scale for the
58:53 product owner is is
58:56 communication um how you build
58:57 connections and how you talk so
59:00 basically I think you um and how you
59:04 like how good a manager you are and how
59:07 you can encourage people so basically I
59:09 would recommend to read really books
59:12 about making commun about communication
59:15 uh uh if you if you haven't before so
59:18 like Dale Carnegie or about negotiation
59:21 negotiation is super um some books about
59:25 like I don't really know how it's in
59:26 English I read it in other language it's
59:29 like um you can negotiate about
59:32 everything something like this and
59:36 um um Robert chalini like about how
59:42 to uh influence and uh all these books
59:46 about communication and
59:50 um I also read a book about like uh
59:53 communication iido
59:55 um this the funny one yeah I didn't
59:59 don't really know about so I think you
1:00:01 need to really REM master your
1:00:03 communication skills the first one there
1:00:06 is like books for related to product
1:00:09 ownership like there is a book it's
1:00:11 called professional product owner it's
1:00:14 recommended by scrum you can go to scrum
1:00:16 org and then you see this book and I
1:00:18 read it and it's uh it's pretty much
1:00:21 valuable and it's it give you picture
1:00:24 what the product owner is and also like
1:00:27 uh there is a special book for scrum um
1:00:30 to understand the basics of scrum I mean
1:00:32 the the philosophy of scrum I think uh
1:00:36 so I think it's also good to to read
1:00:39 this
1:00:40 one uh what else
1:00:43 um and some books related to your uh
1:00:47 specific topic for example that I read
1:00:49 about the search
1:00:52 um and oh
1:00:55 I also remember one there is like the
1:00:57 books about strategy called strategize
1:01:00 also like very connected to product
1:01:03 ownership and uh user story mapping also
1:01:06 is um it's it's going to product
1:01:10 ownership basket um yeah and some you
1:01:14 know some books related
1:01:17 to for example e-commerce uh there is
1:01:20 like a book about experimentation and IB
1:01:23 testing uh also very interesting one and
1:01:28 so I I haven't read book about car parts
1:01:32 actually but I think not yet maybe not
1:01:35 yet but
1:01:37 um we actually have like Specialists
1:01:40 more like they they um more in cars and
1:01:44 you can TR grab them in a meeting and
1:01:46 they will explain your stuff but yeah
1:01:49 like I think you can divide some um like
1:01:54 skills you want to develop and and to
1:01:56 grab some books for the skills like this
1:01:59 communication product management by
1:02:01 itself some like about your feature like
1:02:04 I search and about e-commerce and uh
1:02:08 about your domain business domain when
1:02:10 you're working it's also fine to have
1:02:12 some
1:02:14 knowledge one other tip that you shared
1:02:16 with us was learning from everyone these
1:02:19 uh schedule meetings with Engineers Q
1:02:22 Engineers business analysts and just ask
1:02:24 asking them uh like how what did you ask
1:02:28 like what do you expect from the product
1:02:30 owner uh the best product owner in the
1:02:32 company then also having small talk to
1:02:34 build the connection and I guess
1:02:35 learning about what they do that's also
1:02:38 I really like that part I took a not
1:02:41 here really cool yeah I mean I take a
1:02:45 lot of notes like
1:02:46 it's worth is here anyways yeah we
1:02:51 should be wrapping up anything you want
1:02:52 to mention before we finish
1:02:55 yeah um I just want to have some general
1:02:58 advice like uh for me this a story about
1:03:02 how
1:03:05 the barriers in your head had was broken
1:03:09 like uh yeah I didn't have like the same
1:03:12 experience that I did before but it's
1:03:14 possible to to learn and it's it's
1:03:18 possible so if you want to change the
1:03:21 career if you were like wanted to be
1:03:24 different position it's possible so you
1:03:27 just need to break baros in your head
1:03:29 and it would be difficult for the first
1:03:31 half a year yes but uh if you have this
1:03:35 dream to you can do it yeah it's
1:03:38 possible so the main barrier is in your
1:03:42 head
1:03:44 yeah okay thanks a lot I really enjoyed
