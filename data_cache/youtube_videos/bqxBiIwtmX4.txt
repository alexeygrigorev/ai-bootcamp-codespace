2:21 yeah so the yeah welcome to our event
2:24 thank you
2:25 thank you
2:27 and before we go into our main topic of
2:29 today which is um
2:32 understanding the job descriptions
2:35 let's start with your background can you
2:37 tell us about your career journey so far
2:40 oh yeah so well
2:42 i think i guess i have a traditional
2:44 career journey to data science plus
2:47 being at the right place at the right
2:48 time
2:49 um i studied computer science i come
2:51 from romania i came to hanover
2:54 then to do my diploma advice and then i
2:56 stayed to do a phd right that's what you
2:58 do after diploma but anyway um
3:03 and then it was lucky because my phd was
3:05 information retrieval and recommender
3:07 systems and all that that in 2011
3:13 you know there were not so many people
3:14 doing it
3:16 and that led me to
3:18 uh get a job at sync i i remember back
3:21 then i applied for senior pearl
3:23 developer in the data team and i thought
3:26 how hard can it be i did three months of
3:28 pearl coding during my internship at
3:30 microsoft so i guess i can apply for a
3:33 senior pearl developer i mean that is
3:35 the only job they had right on the
3:37 platform so i applied
3:38 it turned out in the interview that i
3:40 didn't actually know that much about
3:41 perl but i did know stuff about a
3:43 commander system so um i got the job
3:47 then and sync is um a job search uh
3:51 portal in germany yeah exactly and um
3:54 austria so the dark area so yeah so i
3:56 stayed there for like three years and a
3:58 half i think and then i took a year off
4:01 um
4:01 doing artsy things
4:03 and kind of trying out startuppy stuff
4:06 and then i wanted to work with data
4:09 again and i started working at my taxi
4:11 which is now called free now and i
4:13 joined first as a data engineering
4:15 because it was like
4:17 that had to be fixed before into data
4:19 science right and um
4:21 and then after we set up everything
4:23 after a year and a half i think we
4:25 started the data science team
4:27 and that
4:28 i was there i think four years and a
4:30 half in the end
4:32 and then i left and i started at no
4:35 official first as a coach i wanted to
4:37 just do it for like six months and then
4:39 like um go do my break thing but then i
4:42 stayed um
4:44 i felt like the coaches you know we need
4:46 to kind of build up the team and like
4:48 having career paths also for coaching
4:50 coaches not first just for students so
4:53 yeah so it's going to be almost two
4:55 years now in uh
4:56 um
4:58 september and then yeah i started with
5:01 the pilot is already at free now i felt
5:03 like i didn't really have a click in
5:07 hamburg you know like peers to exchange
5:10 with i think i've been in many of the
5:13 companies i was like the only woman
5:15 developer and
5:16 it's nice to be a pioneer but
5:19 not really
5:20 and um
5:22 so yeah that's why we started the pie
5:23 ladies i think in hamburg because we saw
5:25 the berlin one was pretty active and
5:27 then we did also
5:29 and then yeah one thing led to another
5:31 and there was like more stuff for the
5:33 community doing and more interesting
5:35 stuff and
5:36 i think it's really
5:40 important and it's also quite rewarding
5:42 in the end right so
5:44 yeah so you tried pretty much everything
5:47 so first you worked in academia as a
5:49 researcher then you joined
5:52 sync as a data scientist then you joined
5:55 another company as a data engineer so
5:57 you built the data engineering platform
5:59 the data pipelines there then you became
6:01 a data scientist again then you
6:03 led a team you start 30 teams which
6:06 means you were like a manager right
6:08 managing your team not really i was more
6:10 really more like so basically when i was
6:12 working xing you have to understand i
6:14 was working exciting doing data science
6:16 in like 2011
6:19 to 2015. so we were writing code in
6:22 scala
6:24 right and our recommender systems were
6:26 elasticsearch doing smart interesting
6:28 queries on elasticsearch that was but
6:31 that hasn't changed
6:33 i mean that's still how people do
6:36 okay so
6:38 um but it was really like product driven
6:41 right so it had to be needed it was not
6:44 so much researchy stuff and i think when
6:46 i came to um free now and we were
6:49 looking at data science and then
6:50 everybody was talking about python
6:52 python and so many libraries and
6:54 everybody was doing things differently
6:55 and then it was like oh i
6:57 some if i would have done my phd now
6:59 things that would have been way faster
7:01 than doing my phd in java right i mean
7:03 you had to implement your own lucien
7:05 remember the scene now it's just like
7:07 it was just
7:09 so much grinding back then to write code
7:11 anyways so
7:13 um
7:15 so what was lacking then when i when we
7:17 started with the data science team we
7:19 had a lot of people we had people that
7:20 had been from data engineering or data
7:22 analytics but they were kind of like
7:25 not experienced in this like product
7:27 mindset right so it was more like cool
7:29 experiments
7:32 that are looking nice in a jupiter
7:34 notebook and but then they were never
7:36 kind of this
7:38 bridging to like it actually gets used
7:39 by someone you know that work that has
7:41 to be done was not really well planned
7:43 and stuff so i ended up actually doing
7:45 product management management until we
7:47 hired someone for the product management
7:50 role and then i took the leadership role
7:53 that's interesting
7:54 and where you hired as a data scientist
7:56 first you realize that you need to to
7:58 build this uh data platform sort of
8:01 thing or
8:02 they hired you as a data engineer first
8:05 or as a data person general data person
8:07 so i applied there were not many jobs in
8:09 hamburg in 2016 when i decided to work
8:12 again with datum
8:14 that was a problem there was like my
8:16 taxi
8:18 i mean of course there was otto and xing
8:20 right but i've been next thing and i was
8:22 gonna i wasn't going to go back and and
8:24 also i kind of learned that seeing that
8:26 i cannot function in a company of the
8:28 size of single larger so i was
8:30 definitely not going to go to auto so um
8:33 and then there were not many things so
8:35 there was good games for games not that
8:37 i'm particularly interested in
8:39 making people play more games so
8:41 so it wasn't like complete culture fit
8:43 for me on that
8:45 side but
8:46 and then my taxi at least i had used the
8:49 app and i found it very useful back then
8:50 it was the only thing that you didn't
8:52 need cash in the morning i was like you
8:55 know being stranded somewhere and you
8:56 need a taxi and you don't have cash it's
8:58 very traumatizing and
9:00 um so yeah so basically
9:03 the job description i applied for was bi
9:05 developer
9:06 okay really unattractive title
9:09 especially because at sync we had the
9:11 different nomenclatures of jobs right so
9:13 bi people were like people working on x
9:15 as all and just doing queries and
9:17 reports and had zero interaction with
9:19 data science i'm talking about 2012 now
9:22 right and
9:24 things probably have changed so
9:26 so here it was different right so uh the
9:28 i development was basically what you
9:30 would call now etl developer right and
9:32 um
9:34 but yeah and the first thing i did i
9:37 said like so they gave me the option you
9:38 could join uh the data analytics teams
9:41 you know you do dashboards and tableau
9:42 and i was like
9:44 no
9:45 so
9:47 i don't think that's like interesting
9:49 for me so or you
9:51 uh help us build a data platform we
9:54 needed to you know the data
9:57 the etl back then at my taxi was you
10:00 will be surprised but it was
10:02 postgres queries glued together in maven
10:07 because the person who originally built
10:09 it was a java developer
10:12 so i have never seen at least it worked
10:14 right it worked yeah so so we had to do
10:18 like put this on airflow and back then
10:20 you know hadoop was like popular so yeah
10:22 so
10:23 and i said like i
10:25 you saw the building blocks and i
10:26 thought like well i've been there seeing
10:28 when the whole data infrastructure was
10:31 built i saw it happening i wasn't really
10:32 getting involved but maybe i and it
10:34 turned out that i had a lot of passive
10:36 knowledge out of that so that was
10:38 helpful
10:38 but yeah
10:40 um i applied and
10:41 the first thing i did i changed the job
10:43 title i said i can't put that job title
10:45 on my cv ever
10:47 and also we cannot hire anybody nobody's
10:49 going to apply that that is like
10:53 you know who is just
10:55 yeah it's just a different market
10:59 yeah now you work as a coach so what do
11:01 you do as a coach like how is it
11:03 different from your previous uh jobs
11:07 well
11:09 now i don't have to worry about not
11:10 caring about the products that i'm
11:12 working on or not because
11:15 i am just teaching people how to be
11:17 responsible data scientists so that
11:19 whenever they go and do stuff they are
11:21 not you know destroying other people's
11:23 lives and
11:24 uh doing um cool thing with
11:27 data so so we are basically
11:31 yeah at no official we're having boot
11:32 camps we're doing data science boot
11:34 camps at least near my team there's also
11:36 data analytics and web and java and
11:40 aws
11:41 but um
11:44 what i did uh we added a lot of like
11:46 product part in the data science
11:48 bootcamp because i feel that that's
11:50 actually the part that is like stopping
11:52 people from getting stuff
11:54 done right
11:56 and a lot of teamwork right so we are
11:58 teaching
11:59 students from coming from different
12:00 backgrounds how to
12:02 be
12:04 well data scientists that you would want
12:06 to work with
12:07 you know so not
12:09 it's like
12:11 yeah i don't know how to say not like
12:13 someone finishes in university and they
12:14 just learn how to you know all the tools
12:17 but they can't work in a team because
12:19 universities don't
12:21 teach working in teams
12:23 and um all sorts of things so
12:26 so basically that and we get a lot of
12:27 phds right and you know how it is with
12:29 phds i think there's
12:33 perceived people when you don't know
12:35 where the person did the phd or not
12:37 right but a lot of people think well
12:38 person who did phd they worked alone the
12:40 whole time they don't collaborate well
12:42 they don't get well contradicted you
12:44 know you cannot um
12:48 depending on where they did it right so
12:50 some phds are completely different of
12:52 course but
12:53 a lot you hear a lot of people that say
12:54 oh we hired already a lot of phds it
12:56 didn't work well we're not hiring phds
12:58 anymore so
13:00 it's like people companies just go like
13:02 180s on this right so
13:05 um yeah
13:06 people too
13:08 yeah funny that you mentioned that
13:09 because uh i remember it was uh
13:12 there was a time when companies would
13:14 hire only phds
13:16 and then you're saying now uh yeah we
13:18 tried that didn't work let's not have
13:20 phds at all
13:22 why does it all have to be so black and
13:24 white right yeah exactly yeah
13:27 so yeah and then i'm also of course we
13:29 are
13:30 10 coaches so we are
13:33 working as a team and trying to find
13:35 sustainable ways of working and growing
13:38 so
13:39 that's you know because you need to
13:42 like that the field of data just is so
13:45 fluid right at the moment it just
13:47 changes
13:48 all the time and you have to stay on top
13:50 of the game a little bit
13:52 yeah
13:53 and actually what we wanted to talk
13:54 about in this interview is decoding uh
13:57 understanding data science job
13:58 descriptions
13:59 and a while ago you gave a talk with the
14:01 same name similar name decoding the data
14:04 science job description
14:05 and that is a great talk and
14:08 i wanted to talk a bit about that
14:11 here so you started the talk by saying
14:14 that there is a mismatch between
14:15 expectations and reality for both
14:17 candidates and companies and i think we
14:19 talked a little bit about this already
14:22 like hiring phds right so first company
14:24 expected that they would just hire a
14:26 bunch of phds and things would magically
14:28 happen and then things didn't magically
14:31 happen okay something must be wrong with
14:32 the phds right so let's not hire them so
14:35 there is some mismatch right so can you
14:37 tell us more about this why does this
14:39 match happen
14:41 i think
14:42 um so talking from the company
14:44 perspective right so
14:46 i think companies are
14:49 not all the companies of course but i
14:50 think most companies like just imagine
14:53 you go on linkedin and you look at data
14:54 science jobs and then you get depressed
14:56 and you close linkedin
14:58 you know you're like wondering where is
14:59 that feeling coming from
15:01 so
15:02 there's a lot of copy pasting going
15:04 around right and you have this this
15:06 feeling is like they're not really
15:07 intentional there's no intent in how
15:10 they're writing this job description
15:11 it's just about hey we need to hire some
15:13 people let's copy what other people are
15:15 writing and let's hire some people
15:17 and i think
15:20 this kind of comes out can come out but
15:23 sometimes you don't have a choice and
15:24 you have to go with it right but it's
15:26 more like
15:27 so first companies don't usually know
15:29 what they want
15:30 what they need right so i don't know
15:33 sometimes they find out through the job
15:35 interview process right so they don't
15:37 hire the first person the second person
15:38 by the fifth person the interview they
15:40 have like done their research
15:42 now they know who they want to hire this
15:44 happens right
15:47 but sometimes also
15:49 um they
15:50 the way interviews are done in most
15:52 companies is like
15:55 it has a different aim than
15:57 you know like so instead of telling a
15:59 person this is what you're gonna do at
16:01 work in the next time and does this
16:03 align with your needs you tell a person
16:05 hey these are all the things that you
16:07 need to know and
16:08 then the job interview is about
16:10 understanding if the person is smart
16:13 and also can we understand if the person
16:15 is smart with least effort possible so
16:17 we start with the take me home challenge
16:19 which we say it's for four hours but
16:21 everybody knows it's the least effort
16:22 for the company side right not for the
16:24 candidate yeah yeah for the company side
16:26 it's four hours they say that but then
16:28 in the end it's like if you want to do a
16:29 good job you spend like a month yeah a
16:31 month sometimes right
16:34 and and like for example you can see
16:36 like compa there are some companies that
16:38 they put the take me home challenge very
16:40 early on in the interview process
16:43 yeah i i remember i had a case when even
16:47 before talking to a human yeah it was
16:49 just an automatic email saying hey like
16:51 please do this home take interview at
16:54 home take challenge and i thought okay
16:56 let me just do this i didn't know that
16:58 something is off here so then i did and
17:00 then say oh sorry like we actually
17:02 forgot to close the position we already
17:04 hired somebody
17:08 yeah thank you yeah
17:10 thanks for telling me about that in
17:11 advance yeah so yeah so exactly so this
17:14 is like
17:16 especially like large companies they
17:18 need they if they are like you know have
17:20 a lot of uh pr out there and
17:23 um
17:24 nice branding you know a lot of people
17:26 apply and then it it becomes this indeed
17:28 like work to review those people and
17:32 and i'm not sure if every company is
17:34 allocating enough resources
17:36 to kind of have proper interviews of you
17:39 know of people right and it's more like
17:41 oh yeah we will figure it out in the
17:42 probation period if it works out or not
17:45 but but germany is not a good country to
17:46 fire people in probation period it's not
17:48 really normal to just you know
17:51 you know i think it happens in other
17:52 countries more often that people get
17:54 fired way faster but in germany but in
17:56 general i guess it's not uh like i
17:58 imagine for a candidate who got hired
18:00 and had some expectations and then
18:02 like and for the company letting go
18:04 people is also stressful like
18:07 i i am a manager and i cannot imagine
18:10 how difficult it is to fire somebody
18:12 right it's stressful for both sides
18:13 right yeah
18:15 yeah exactly but i've heard quite often
18:17 also people that got a job and it turned
18:19 out that it's completely different than
18:20 what they expected right so
18:23 so basically
18:25 and i think on the other side the goals
18:27 of candidates are also i think a lot of
18:29 people don't really sit down with
18:31 themselves and write down their goals
18:33 you know
18:34 so people also just sometimes go like a
18:36 little bit uninformed in the job
18:38 interviews like just imagine if you're a
18:41 manager you've had interviews with
18:43 people imagine how many people didn't
18:45 ask questions like remember you know
18:47 there's a lot there's some people that
18:49 don't ask questions and you're like
18:51 interesting uh
18:53 is this person applying at 100 jobs now
18:55 so it doesn't matter where they are
18:57 getting a job
18:59 so
19:00 so basically
19:02 um
19:02 [Music]
19:04 to find out what is important for you
19:06 and kind of inform yourself if that's
19:08 happening right um so that's like
19:13 you think so people take it for granted
19:15 right that
19:17 the stuff that is important for them is
19:19 going to be fine
19:21 and it's not the case right so the to
19:25 summarize the misalignment at least from
19:26 the company uh point of view happens
19:29 because first of all companies don't
19:30 know who they want need and second is
19:33 they want to do it with the least amount
19:35 of time from their site right and then
19:38 it happens
19:39 and i guess uh so
19:42 coming back to your story how you ended
19:44 up at my taxi so you applied for a bi
19:46 developer
19:47 and this wasn't exactly what they needed
19:50 right
19:52 yeah the title was wrong
19:54 okay
19:55 was the description also wrong or it
19:58 wasn't
19:59 no i think the description
20:04 one
20:06 it was a while ago but i basically for
20:08 me i read the description i thought this
20:10 is data engineering you know 2016 right
20:12 so
20:14 i thought this is data engineering you
20:16 know yeah like you set up like a data
20:18 warehouse and you
20:20 create the platform for the analytics
20:23 team to work on basically
20:25 um
20:26 but it was definitely not bi developer
20:30 i was like okay
20:32 yeah
20:33 but here um let's say we are a candidate
20:36 so we want to
20:37 apply for a job and then we come across
20:40 a job that a job description right so we
20:42 don't want to
20:43 get hired start working and then only
20:45 then to find out that it's not what we
20:47 want right we don't because leaving a
20:50 company stressful
20:51 even worse being fired right so if so if
20:54 you let go that it's even worse even
20:56 having a lot of job interviews is like
20:58 yeah a lot of time right like if you
21:00 think about it like think about it as a
21:01 pyramid you can like look at a hundred
21:04 job description you can probably
21:06 interview first interview around with 20
21:09 you can have how many take me home
21:11 challenges like if you think of five
21:13 take me home challenges that is like
21:15 five weeks
21:17 of yeah like if you want to do it right
21:20 right
21:20 and then you take one job so it becomes
21:23 like the cost the further down the
21:25 interview line you go it becomes the
21:27 more time consuming and effort it's like
21:30 companies what they do is first they do
21:32 the cd screening round so they look at
21:34 the candidate cv
21:36 and the job description is a similar
21:38 thing but from the other side right for
21:41 the candidates
21:42 so
21:44 how can we make sure that description
21:46 matches what we want
21:50 right so
21:52 so first of all you have to think about
21:53 what you want and you also have to think
21:55 about
21:57 where you are in your career
21:59 right because this changes a little bit
22:01 what you need from what you want
22:04 right so so i think in general one also
22:08 what yeah like
22:10 identify the overlap between needs and
22:12 ones right because like one thing
22:14 something might still be the wrong thing
22:16 to have right so for example a person at
22:19 the beginning of their career
22:22 um working in a data science team that
22:25 is not a team it's just one person is
22:27 not going to be very rewarding or
22:29 helping them out
22:31 with you know growing because they will
22:33 end up doing like all sorts of random
22:35 things that are probably not really data
22:37 science related
22:39 so you have to have some experience
22:41 right so you need to know that if your
22:42 junior just graded from university or
22:44 from boot camp
22:47 starting a team or starting as a sole
22:49 data scientist in a startup might not be
22:52 the best idea right
22:54 and
22:55 but there are some people that have the
22:56 personality for it right okay
22:59 it's not for everyone
23:00 yeah that they are thriving on this like
23:02 chaos
23:03 and
23:04 like experimenting often and figuring
23:06 out stuff right
23:08 but then there are people that want like
23:10 to take it slow and have stability and
23:12 then enjoy their time and then that's
23:14 like you know like then you need a
23:16 bigger company right you need a bigger
23:18 team you need like a team where like
23:20 stuff is defined processes are defined
23:22 and you just have to kind of do your
23:23 thing for a bit right so so yeah so this
23:26 is on one side from the candidate
23:28 perspective to to to kind of have this
23:31 um
23:33 to identify with yourself like are you
23:35 at the part where you still need to get
23:37 good at the test part like on this
23:39 little specialization thing that you're
23:41 doing whether it's data science or
23:43 analytics
23:44 or are you at the part that
23:46 you should get good at like generalizing
23:50 right like okay i now wanna know
23:54 okay i can do all the data science part
23:56 but i wanna now know machine learning
23:57 engineer and i also wanna learn
23:59 ml ops and also the analytics part
24:02 because i wanna be able to better
24:03 monitor my models and then you know and
24:06 then like put stuff in like i want to go
24:08 all over the place i'm there yet right
24:10 and what is the right order to do this
24:12 now again i don't it depends right so
24:14 for some people either order works for
24:17 some people it doesn't right so this is
24:19 a thing of personality but
24:21 so in my talk i was structuring things
24:23 based on um
24:25 to basically take a look at it if you
24:27 can find information about the team if
24:29 you can find information about the role
24:31 itself if you can find information about
24:33 the culture of the company
24:35 and also about
24:37 well i added now new newer like the
24:40 retention like what is like down the
24:42 line like if you think about it in a
24:44 couple of years
24:45 how would it still look like would you
24:47 still be there right because
24:49 sometimes it matters sometimes you are
24:51 at the part where you just want to have
24:52 a couple of jobs in your cv or like
24:54 you're exploring so and then it doesn't
24:56 matter you can be six months somewhere
24:58 and then another you
25:00 you needed a ramp up right but sometimes
25:03 you want to be there longer
25:05 so i think
25:07 yeah
25:08 on all of this aspect i think it's
25:09 important to kind of like do a little
25:11 bit of research to figure out if it's a
25:13 match it's a
25:15 it's a fit or if there's like stuff that
25:17 is a little bit like
25:19 borderline and then
25:21 yeah and then it's like
25:23 how i say then you have to find out in
25:25 the further down the interview if
25:28 stuff is there or missing or wrong
25:31 because it's ignorance or it's because
25:33 it's
25:34 intentional
25:36 and my stuff is there you mean in the
25:38 job description right yeah what kind of
25:39 stuff
25:40 yeah like for example like why is the
25:42 team not mentioned in the job
25:44 description
25:46 is that because they don't know how to
25:47 write a job description or because uh
25:50 intentionally because there is no team
25:52 so
25:53 and a good example would be like we are
25:56 looking for a data scientist to join our
25:58 search and recommendation team right so
26:00 then it's clear which team it will be
26:02 but the team is working on
26:05 and if it's like okay we're looking for
26:07 somebody with five years of experience
26:08 in
26:09 data science and pearl and i don't know
26:12 aws and docker and
26:14 just a bunch of things and then apply
26:16 here and then you're thinking okay what
26:18 exactly is this right yeah you're like
26:21 this is a little bit like
26:23 i guess
26:24 they are desperate
26:26 they
26:27 they searched they saw online that this
26:29 is what people are hiring these days and
26:31 they want to want to or something i
26:32 don't know
26:33 yeah
26:34 yeah so kind of like this so this is
26:36 basically
26:38 sometimes the job description is not
26:39 enough to figure out why is something
26:41 there or not there right if it's like
26:44 on purpose or if they're like yeah it's
26:47 the first time they're hiring kind of
26:49 like this or it's a new person writing
26:51 the job description or they didn't do
26:52 proper research you know it can also be
26:54 that it's harmless right it's like it's
26:57 just out of ignorance
26:58 okay
27:00 do you have
27:01 maybe some sort of a checklist of things
27:04 that we should
27:05 try to find in the job description and
27:07 if they are missing we should ask so one
27:09 thing you mentioned team should be
27:11 mentioned
27:12 and area on which you work you will work
27:16 other other things
27:18 yeah so so basically
27:21 for example for a data science job i
27:23 think it is also like for data science
27:25 right so data science is
27:28 the part that is coming down the line of
27:31 data right it's not the stuff that the
27:33 company starts with
27:35 so if you want to like make the data
27:37 people applying like relaxed about it
27:40 you should just mention the fact that
27:41 you already have a data engineering
27:43 platform that you already have a data
27:45 infrastructure you already have a
27:48 data analytics team to kind of you know
27:51 so
27:52 but you can also see this from the
27:55 information what they want like if you
27:57 are apply as a data scientist and they
27:59 ask you all sorts of tools like all the
28:01 tools of all all over the
28:03 uh space of data then you already know
28:06 that that's like
28:09 you're not really gonna do data science
28:11 right so
28:12 um
28:14 so yeah so basically the checklist is
28:15 like on the team side i would say figure
28:18 it out if there's a team mentioned how
28:19 is that team mentioned like
28:22 um
28:23 what do they say about the team and one
28:25 thing that is like also like borderline
28:27 with culture here is do they have
28:28 juniors in the team or not
28:30 um maybe they don't have juniors in this
28:32 team but they have juniors in other
28:34 teams like this is taking it to the
28:35 culture level right but i guess this is
28:37 not something you check on the job
28:39 description but rather maybe go to
28:41 linkedin and then see okay what the
28:43 people who work in this company other
28:45 people with the junior title exactly
28:47 yeah another thing is like on the job
28:49 description i think on the role itself
28:51 so there's this part of the role it's
28:52 like the must-haves and then the nice to
28:54 haves right
28:56 um would be the
28:58 like your responsibilities and things
29:01 you do at work so
29:02 and here this can range from being
29:05 well-defined
29:07 to being like a bullet point of all the
29:10 tech stack that is out there
29:13 right so
29:14 or like
29:17 i have this
29:18 this is a new pa this is a nice paradigm
29:20 that not a lot of people are using is
29:21 this like objective um
29:24 um like having objectives already
29:27 mentioned in the job description so
29:29 if you think about it which kind of
29:31 job would you apply one that says you
29:34 have to have a phd in whatever plus
29:36 three years work experience or
29:39 um in the first six months you will your
29:41 task is to improve three of our machine
29:43 learning models to improve their
29:45 performance like
29:47 i mean
29:48 i'm making it as a joke but like can you
29:50 get a phd in three years work experience
29:52 in six months no so you're like you
29:54 might be able to and then the job itself
29:56 is improving machine learning models i
29:58 mean
29:59 really missing out on talent just by
30:02 having this
30:03 um because i wouldn't apply if i
30:05 wouldn't have a phd and they asked for a
30:07 phd right okay so so objectives uh so we
30:11 need to
30:12 have a team mentioned right so then
30:14 uh responsibility should be when def
30:17 well-defined with objectives not just a
30:18 list of technologies right yeah not like
30:20 hey it was would be nice if you know
30:23 everything because maybe some of the
30:24 stuff is going to be relevant to
30:26 actually something that we are going to
30:27 be doing we don't know yet what we're
30:29 doing so this is how i would interpret
30:31 it right like we have absolutely no idea
30:33 what this person is supposed to be doing
30:35 so we're just putting all the possible
30:37 skills
30:38 which might actually not be the case
30:40 guys
30:40 again
30:41 ignorance versus
30:44 but this is something to think about
30:46 when you have the first interview second
30:48 interview to ask them actually right so
30:50 at least you need to do some homework
30:52 and figure out okay
30:54 what do i really need to ask them and
30:56 the job description is a good indicator
30:58 if uh
30:59 like they know what the who they want or
31:01 not right yeah
31:02 the other thing is also if they talk
31:04 about diversity on the job description i
31:06 think
31:08 equal employment opportunity
31:11 um
31:11 [Music]
31:13 saying whether they care about diversity
31:15 and
31:16 so most of the time i think it's it's
31:18 starting to be the normal thing to do
31:19 right
31:20 whether it's like
31:22 part of the culture or it's just like pr
31:25 marketing that's something to find out
31:27 in the
31:28 interview process
31:30 um
31:34 but like wording that is off-putting is
31:36 already like a sign of lack of diversity
31:40 so
31:40 so
31:41 like the language on the job description
31:43 right so i think like for example if i
31:45 see a job description that hires a rock
31:47 star or a ninja or something i don't
31:49 apply
31:50 and i would also like i just i don't
31:52 even actually have that conversation
31:54 further
31:55 like there is
31:57 i i don't even like say like like
32:00 2022 maybe three years ago this would
32:03 have been ignorance
32:04 but now i just think you you have a team
32:08 that is thriving on competition and not
32:10 on collaboration
32:12 it's like just like that you know so
32:16 i'm like
32:17 i would never recommend anybody to apply
32:19 to a job like as like
32:22 like ninja or rockstar
32:25 yeah this is something actually we
32:26 talked last week on the podcast with
32:30 olga
32:31 and
32:32 we discussed a tool
32:34 for
32:36 there is a tool that analyzes the
32:38 language of the job description and it
32:40 says
32:41 the gender decoder
32:43 i i don't know if it's a gender decoder
32:45 but it says that okay this word like
32:47 avoid using this word or not a word
32:50 they say okay
32:53 like if you use this word it would
32:55 attract more
32:57 female more males than females right so
32:59 consider changing it to to this
33:02 and
33:03 yeah and i
33:06 to for example for me as a candidate so
33:08 maybe i am ignorant and i don't always
33:11 see this red flux but now you mentioned
33:14 rockstar ninja are there other things
33:16 that
33:18 you would consider like maybe not red
33:20 flags but the
33:22 good
33:23 good indicators that maybe something
33:25 might be off
33:32 so basically ah let's see so
33:37 well
33:38 a lot of bullet points is off right so i
33:41 have a lot of bullet points so from the
33:43 research that i was doing for this talk
33:45 it actually
33:46 um it's a sign of rigid interview
33:50 process
33:51 um
33:53 because the thing is that the person
33:54 interviewing you will end up asking you
33:57 questions that you could just google
33:59 right
34:01 now this is what happens
34:03 questions about how you think about
34:05 solving a problem which is in the end
34:06 what you actually have to do at work
34:08 right but they're gonna ask you like
34:10 syntax questions for like random tools
34:13 that or programming languages that they
34:15 have there so
34:18 there's yeah so that's that's an uh that
34:21 is a um
34:23 again goes back in the culture right so
34:26 of the interview practice now again
34:30 um
34:32 this is work that can be done on the
34:34 candidate side so most of the companies
34:37 actually do not put in the work to fix
34:39 their job description on the you know
34:41 gender decoding and all sorts of things
34:44 so
34:45 sometimes like you might feel like you
34:48 like the company and you like the role
34:51 but
34:52 you you read the job description and you
34:53 don't really feel like applying and then
34:55 you realize that it's because of the
34:57 language they or you don't even know
34:59 this is all subconscious what's
35:00 happening right it's not like oh um
35:04 i don't like it you know so apparently
35:07 so
35:08 what linkedin
35:09 so there was this research right like
35:10 apparently women apply less to these
35:12 jobs that have like off-putting language
35:14 but also women actually get more of the
35:17 jobs that they apply to because they do
35:18 this research so um
35:21 more right and whereas
35:24 maybe for men there's
35:26 less information on a job description
35:28 that would like make it off-putting you
35:31 know
35:32 but
35:33 yeah but there's like words right like
35:35 saying like we're expecting you to so
35:37 junior position and we're expecting you
35:39 to work fully
35:40 autonomously
35:42 you know like
35:44 you know
35:45 who's gonna do that right um
35:48 or have that expectation of a junior
35:50 right even for like
35:52 many people
35:54 first like
35:56 it depends i mean you want some autonomy
35:58 but you also want some goals right or
35:59 some guidance um
36:03 i don't know
36:04 it's
36:05 i know like good examples like very rare
36:08 examples that when they are there you're
36:10 like
36:10 feeling oh that is such a nice job oh
36:13 that is like i don't need this job like
36:15 it's completely out of my range of
36:17 expertise so i kind of there's very few
36:19 like that right i've seen there was a
36:22 job that had
36:25 the
36:26 short paragraphs about every team member
36:29 this is the person you're going to work
36:30 with
36:31 interesting
36:33 uh yeah that doesn't happen often no
36:37 exactly right and uh to like be like you
36:40 see that they put a lot of effort in
36:42 creating that job description right like
36:44 um
36:44 [Music]
36:46 or job descriptions that i like this
36:48 style telling you like this is what
36:50 you're gonna do in your first two weeks
36:51 what you're gonna do in the next three
36:53 months and what you're going to do in
36:54 the next six months
36:57 um
36:58 this is something you ask on the
36:59 interview right
37:01 you could also have it in the job
37:02 description
37:03 uh-huh okay okay i mean yeah right and
37:06 then you don't have to ask this on the
37:08 exactly so you're exactly so you could
37:10 put it in the job description and that's
37:12 like already like
37:14 i mean for people doing job description
37:16 when you have a lot of repetitive
37:17 questions asked in the interview by the
37:19 candidate you could just as well add it
37:22 again lack of salary
37:24 on the job description
37:26 i know most companies have the lack of
37:28 salary
37:29 in germany it's very difficult for to
37:31 find companies who actually put salary
37:35 on the
37:36 listing yeah especially because we wanna
37:43 news flash for everybody it is no longer
37:46 illegal in germany to talk about your
37:48 salary
37:49 and news flash for companies expecting
37:51 candy the people working at your company
37:53 to not talk about salary is being naive
37:56 about it
37:57 yeah so
38:00 it is really more expensive to
38:03 lose employees because of lack of
38:05 transparency on the salary then just fix
38:07 the salaries
38:09 so because but yeah so basically i can
38:13 um every time i talk to someone that was
38:15 saying like yeah i'm having a job
38:17 opening i would love to put the salaries
38:19 but i can't
38:20 and then i'm saying
38:22 oh
38:23 so
38:24 i think this is why you don't put the
38:26 salaries right and they're they're like
38:28 yeah that's why
38:29 and the reasons are
38:30 we have not fixed the salaries
38:32 internally and we have older people that
38:34 don't have the right salary and or
38:35 people in different regions that don't
38:37 have right so then we can't do this
38:39 so so in the end every information that
38:42 you think comes from now salary on the
38:45 thing is true
38:47 i know so
38:49 i can yeah
38:50 okay you mentioned we mentioned a couple
38:52 of times that it's important to do some
38:54 research so for example to see how many
38:57 juniors are in the company by going to
38:59 linkedin and then checking this
39:02 how do we actually do this so in
39:04 addition to this checking how many
39:05 juniors are there in the company what
39:07 else can we do
39:08 just do we just go to google put in the
39:11 name of the company
39:13 and look at the first page or there's uh
39:15 an approach that we can take
39:18 so yeah so some companies they have the
39:20 team on so the smaller startups they
39:22 actually have the team on their website
39:24 right now you can take a look there and
39:26 you see the color of the people the
39:28 gender of the people and
39:30 if you are feel represented by that then
39:32 or
39:35 if you want to contribute to a lack of
39:37 diversity then go for it um now
39:40 or
39:41 yeah so
39:42 so i think that's one way so for the
39:44 ones right now there are some companies
39:47 um
39:48 i think
39:50 sure going to linkedin or seeing or
39:52 whatever and just checking who's working
39:54 there and like third degree network
39:56 second degree network and
39:58 um another thing is like on the team
40:00 stuff is like
40:02 i think what's really something people
40:04 don't really think about it is that you
40:06 spend 30 percent of your time with the
40:08 work colleagues
40:11 so
40:12 some of us not everybody some of us are
40:14 at parts in our careers where we like to
40:16 work with people that inspire us
40:19 so this is something you can find out
40:21 are there any people in that team or in
40:23 that company that you find inspiring any
40:25 role models you know and that's like you
40:27 can check if they do conference talks
40:29 meetups
40:30 um and so on right so
40:34 that's something that like taking it an
40:36 extra mile to kind of figure it out you
40:38 can also check
40:39 past employees on linkedin you can
40:41 figure out also past employees you can
40:43 see how long they worked in a company
40:46 also the other one regarding career
40:49 pipelines sure you can check you can ask
40:53 in the interview about the career gra
40:56 if they have pipelines for the career
40:58 and whatnot my plan is like uh maturity
41:00 like career leader like junior uh middle
41:02 senior and so on right exactly but you
41:04 can also check that out on linkedin to
41:07 see how many people
41:08 change their jobs
41:10 within the company
41:13 or like how many become
41:16 seniors right or how many become i don't
41:18 know managers because a lot of people a
41:19 lot of companies you know it takes for
41:22 many bigger companies right it takes
41:25 usually a moment of crisis to figure out
41:28 that they have to fix the culture and
41:29 that moment of crisis is when it happens
41:33 it happened everywhere right where like
41:35 at some point it happens
41:38 it turns out that it's easier to get
41:40 promoted by just leaving the company
41:41 then
41:43 staying right
41:44 and after a lot of people do that then
41:46 they realize oh we need to
41:49 yes apparently we have a problem and
41:51 then they have nice culture right but
41:55 i mean
41:58 which is fine it's just good to know
41:59 about it right because then you know
42:00 where you are and what you have to do
42:02 with it right maybe it's really
42:04 important for you to have a two-year job
42:06 and then like move on because the team
42:08 is still great to learn from and people
42:09 are great to learn from
42:12 but you also know that some of those
42:14 people great to learn from are going to
42:16 leave while you're there because they
42:17 are going to feel disenchanted with the
42:20 process
42:21 so yeah so i think um
42:25 yeah so basically yeah so you check the
42:29 you basically check linkedin check what
42:31 people are doing check what the company
42:32 is doing what kind of
42:35 statements they make online
42:38 and um
42:40 and i think one of the things that
42:43 everybody has to decide for themselves
42:45 is like do they need to care about what
42:47 products the company is doing
42:50 right what is the mission of the company
42:53 what
42:54 what are the things that the company is
42:57 you know creating what are the values of
42:59 the company
43:00 because
43:03 i think depends right so some people
43:06 want job stability you know they're like
43:09 at that point
43:10 old school that's how it was before like
43:13 you worked you wanted you worked
43:14 somewhere for 30 years right that's how
43:16 it was and now you work somewhere for
43:18 three years
43:19 and then another place for three years
43:21 so job stability is no longer the thing
43:23 right so you want to be motivated
43:26 you want to enjoy your work and you want
43:28 to
43:30 learn because you like learning and it's
43:32 like cool and stuff so maybe then it is
43:35 important that you
43:36 are motivated
43:39 so but this is something that you have
43:40 to learn about yourself right not
43:42 everybody needs to care
43:44 about them
43:45 of course yeah i think that goes back to
43:47 what you mentioned at the
43:50 beginning so you need to
43:52 first
43:53 understand what you yourself want before
43:56 starting to read the job description and
43:59 see if this is much as
44:01 uh
44:02 what you want right so first you need to
44:04 understand what you want
44:06 by the way is there any good approach so
44:08 let's say i don't want i just want to
44:10 have a job
44:12 like do i need to how can i approach
44:14 this
44:16 like of course uh i can learn from my
44:18 past mistakes so for example not
44:20 mistakes or mismatches
44:23 so for example i worked at the company
44:25 where it was very difficult to work from
44:27 home and then for me then i interviewed
44:29 for the next company i asked for this in
44:32 advance right okay like can i work from
44:33 home or well with kovit i guess everyone
44:36 had to work from home but before that
44:38 like it was a
44:39 thing that i would ask
44:41 is there any uh like so now ask about
44:44 what kind of processes they have in
44:46 place for people to successfully work
44:47 from home
44:49 okay because because of like you we have
44:52 to agree right like working from home
44:55 and being completely remote is not an
44:57 organic process
45:00 it needs
45:01 support right it needs work
45:03 and if that doesn't
45:05 happen in a company then you will go
45:07 into here like one year later we've
45:09 decided that everybody has to come to
45:11 work oh and we don't have parking lots
45:12 right like at tesla
45:18 yeah so i guess uh well one thing you
45:21 can do is learn from experience that
45:23 okay you have to go to the office but
45:26 uh now when you already signed the
45:28 contract you come to the office on your
45:29 car and you find out that there is no
45:31 parking slot right and then it's oops
45:33 situation the next time you look for a
45:34 job you will ask about this right but is
45:37 there a systematic way of thinking what
45:39 do i actually want what do i actually
45:41 need
45:42 instead of making all these mistakes
45:44 learning from these mistakes and you
45:46 know going
45:47 there and
45:49 you know just
45:51 signing up for a job that maybe does not
45:54 match what you need like is there a
45:55 systematic way to figure out what you
45:57 need when you don't have this 10 years
46:00 of experience
46:02 well actually basically
46:06 so it depends on each person right so
46:08 for some people the culture won't matter
46:10 because they are the majority
46:12 so they won't notice things
46:15 uh if you're part of an underrepresented
46:17 group in text and the culture will
46:19 matter more than
46:21 other things
46:22 so you need to prioritize what is like
46:25 most important to you right
46:27 is the mission the culture for example
46:31 you have to be aware that
46:32 if the culture matters to you then you
46:34 need to know to go in a company that has
46:36 good culture because
46:38 working on fixing the culture takes away
46:41 from your
46:42 development career development right
46:45 and then you're like oh why am i not
46:47 growing in my career as fast as other
46:49 people right so
46:51 maybe you are at that part in your
46:52 career where it's not so expensive to
46:54 not learn as fast right so so yeah you
46:57 need to prioritize you basically you can
46:59 do this list okay so i need the team i
47:00 need the mission so i need so what do i
47:03 have so i have
47:04 team the role the culture and the
47:06 retention right so
47:09 um what is really important for me so do
47:11 i care about the culture more do i care
47:14 about the team do i care about uh
47:17 which ones are basically
47:21 must-haves right and which ones are okay
47:23 it's fine if it's not like the team
47:25 right so if you're experienced then it
47:27 doesn't really matter if the team is
47:29 large or small or created or not you can
47:31 make a team right
47:32 but if you're at the beginning of your
47:34 career then you probably care about the
47:36 team quite a lot who's in that team
47:38 um
47:40 then again retention
47:43 if your
47:47 experience the retention part might
47:49 matter more because
47:52 if they're intended if like a lot of
47:54 employees are quitting often and stuff
47:56 like that that's a sign of something not
47:58 being done right
48:00 and it's going to be frustrating down
48:01 the line and
48:04 i don't know so and you're going to be
48:06 like
48:07 not really managing to do stuff right
48:09 much at work
48:10 and
48:11 there's a reason i think behind it right
48:13 so
48:14 um
48:16 so yeah so
48:18 basically and the other one thing like
48:21 which is also really important does the
48:23 company i mean they have a data science
48:25 job description but do they really
48:27 really need a data scientist
48:29 how do you find out
48:31 well so this is what you have to
48:33 actually first you have to figure out if
48:35 they actually have a data infrastructure
48:37 so i think in my talk i was talking
48:38 about like companies are like before
48:40 data during data and after data right so
48:43 which stage are they in so before data
48:45 they don't need a data scientist so they
48:48 need to start like tracking they need to
48:50 kind of start with the culture then like
48:52 with the data right then while they're
48:55 becoming data driven they probably have
48:57 a data infrastructure and then they have
48:59 data scientists but again
49:01 most of the stuff the data scientists
49:03 are doing might not actually make it to
49:04 production because it's not like an
49:06 established culture in the company and
49:08 there's going to be a lot of advocacy
49:10 going on and
49:12 so
49:12 a good question to
49:14 ask in the interviews would be like who
49:17 in the company wants the company to be
49:19 data-driven
49:21 who in the company wants the company to
49:23 be data treatment yeah
49:26 interesting i mean it's the same with
49:27 diversity right they say like if a
49:29 company wants to start being diverse and
49:32 everything it has to be a top-down move
49:36 you know like
49:37 if the sea level
49:40 doesn't push for it they will actually
49:42 resist it
49:43 and the same for data culture it's a
49:45 culture shift we're going from no not
49:47 being data driven to being data driven
49:49 it's a culture shift right it's not
49:50 really happening overnight it's
49:52 happening with a lot of stuff
49:54 disrupting day-to-day work
49:57 so you need to be told
49:59 every team needs to be told that that's
50:01 the way we are going and that's where we
50:03 are going and not be like
50:06 we only go there if it's easy or you
50:08 know if we can do it on friday
50:11 so yeah
50:12 why does it matter for me as a candidate
50:14 why does it matter if a company at which
50:17 maturity stage it is or if it's before
50:20 data during date or after data
50:23 well i think it's more to kind of figure
50:26 out so you can basically identify what
50:28 is the work you're going to do
50:30 so
50:32 so like
50:33 how so you know data science is
50:36 um
50:36 [Music]
50:38 like there's this all this visualization
50:41 about this this this like you you gather
50:43 the business uh propose like what is the
50:46 business value what are you building why
50:47 you're building it then you get the data
50:49 and then you do some like modeling is
50:51 usually business thing there's stripe
50:53 and then presenting and whatnot now
50:56 how big this
50:58 you know pies the the
51:00 the slices in the pies you know which
51:03 where is your effort gonna go that's
51:05 kind of
51:06 um it's like before data most of your
51:09 work is going to be in
51:11 just communicating with stuff with
51:13 people
51:15 and it's going to be like the first
51:16 communication like getting business
51:18 proposals and stuff and it's not going
51:20 to be so much as maybe you're going to
51:22 do some modeling but there's just no
51:25 infrastructure to help you with putting
51:27 that out there right i mean if the
51:29 infrastructure is not there so it's
51:30 going to be like
51:33 first communicating then building this
51:35 infrastructure and then maybe finally
51:37 after three years training that first
51:39 linear regression right
51:41 yeah and then like the team that you're
51:43 going to give this to are going to be
51:44 like wait but we were already doing it
51:46 differently before and it was working
51:48 and now you're like making us lose our
51:50 job
51:52 or you know you're replacing so so
51:55 that's like uh this is especially so you
51:57 have to this is also like a funny
51:59 question to ask so okay so your company
52:01 is like this this this when did you
52:03 start doing data stuff
52:06 right so if they say that they were like
52:08 i don't know eight years old when they
52:10 started doing data and now they're one
52:11 year in the process
52:13 so one year is not enough for a culture
52:15 shift
52:17 are still the company is still in the
52:18 culture shift
52:20 it's
52:21 and this is more about to know like if
52:23 this fits to you like
52:25 like are you a good communicator or are
52:28 you like an introvert that just wants to
52:30 do the thing and like kind of you know
52:32 because
52:33 or like you're
52:34 really
52:35 tech oriented and whatnot because this
52:38 is not going to be a good space for you
52:40 right
52:41 or are you a good communicator then
52:43 you're going to thrive there of course
52:44 you're not going to become this stellar
52:46 data scientist that would have
52:49 gotten the stage to do fancy models all
52:51 the time but you're going to
52:53 maybe go into more into product so
52:57 yeah
52:58 because maybe not not
53:01 now but a couple of years ago there was
53:03 this impression that what data
53:05 scientists do at work is the same kind
53:07 of stuff you would do at kaggle
53:09 so get the clean data set train a model
53:11 squeeze everything from this data as
53:13 much as possible and then you have this
53:15 perfect model that you just deploy right
53:18 and if a company is at the before data
53:20 level well good luck right so there is
53:22 no data at all
53:23 so
53:24 before you can do squeezing where is
53:27 this data tracked oh we didn't track
53:29 this because nobody thought we would
53:30 need it right and you're like okay
53:33 i mean it happens right like bigger
53:34 companies
53:35 and
53:36 and the other thing you have to
53:37 understand i think because of this
53:39 mentality like what data science was and
53:42 you talk to people like they're working
53:43 on a project and you ask them so what
53:45 did you do and they always tell you yeah
53:47 we trained the model to do this and to
53:49 predict that and then you're like why
53:52 so i'm asking why did you do that
53:54 for whom how are they using it right so
53:57 getting like if you don't do this extra
53:59 step
54:01 then that stuff is it's going to be so
54:04 much work to actually getting used
54:05 because by the time you get to the why
54:07 and then what not you figure out that
54:09 actually nobody had the problem you were
54:10 solving
54:13 so but yet they still decide to hire you
54:17 yeah because maybe consultants from
54:19 mckinsey came and said hey you need to
54:21 be data driven so you need to hire one
54:23 data scientist or two data scientists
54:26 here is this awesome slide deck goodbye
54:29 yeah
54:30 this can be happening yeah i mean
54:33 there's also the other kind of companies
54:34 you know like the companies that have ai
54:37 or machine learning
54:38 part of the company title
54:41 okay yeah or like this they have to have
54:44 a data scientist right
54:47 but also there from what sometimes it's
54:49 like
54:50 they're like oh man we have the ai now
54:52 in the title we need to do fancy machine
54:55 learning and the data scientists they're
54:56 about linear regressions to solve their
54:58 problems now
55:00 but it has to be ai and
55:02 so i think
55:04 so i think sometimes the story is a
55:06 little bit different where like uh
55:08 machine learning data science is at the
55:10 core of the company product and then
55:12 that is the product right like
55:15 you don't do image recognition without
55:17 image recognition right if you're
55:19 selling well documents
55:21 right
55:23 but
55:24 but the example i was giving up uh when
55:26 i was giving a talk on the data the
55:28 product at free now is like hey like you
55:30 order a taxi from a to b you know and
55:32 you're sitting there and you're ordering
55:34 and it houses it's going to cost 10
55:36 euros and like how often do you ask
55:37 yourself or a user ask them so so how is
55:40 this model behind this price performing
55:46 it's like
55:47 you know like
55:49 like sitting there and using an app and
55:51 thinking hmm i wonder what model they're
55:53 using for this
55:55 yeah you probably wonder okay 10 euros
55:58 for this trip it's too much or oh
56:00 10 euros good price so let me take it
56:02 yeah exactly and then it was eight euros
56:04 and you're happy or it was 12 years and
56:06 you're like hmm
56:08 it lied to me maybe next time i would be
56:10 like a bit skeptical about this so yeah
56:12 so i think
56:14 so yeah it's a bit it's a jungle out
56:16 there right
56:18 with the job description
56:20 and how can we determine from a job
56:22 description at which level the company
56:24 is so is it uh mature enough or is it
56:26 before data during data or after data i
56:29 guess there are some signals in the
56:31 description right that we can
56:33 use hex tag right so i think i think i
56:36 once looked at a job description in the
56:38 energy domain and it had like text tag
56:40 that i've never heard of
56:42 i was like i i was like i'm not
56:46 it was like not even python right i mean
56:47 it was just like
56:50 it sounded like
56:52 everything is done with excel i don't
56:54 have anything against excel i mean it
56:56 still happens right but still it's like
56:58 i'm like the question is do you want to
57:00 be the person who
57:02 changes this to the
57:04 modern quotes and quotes
57:07 so yeah so checking the text tag you
57:09 know what
57:11 how if
57:12 but this is a little bit like you need a
57:14 little bit of experience with that right
57:16 to figure out it's like is this tech
57:17 stack like belonging together or is like
57:20 a little bit all over the place right
57:23 because if it's all over the place then
57:24 it's like um
57:28 maybe not the thing
57:30 but if it's or if there is any tech
57:32 stack at all right
57:34 yeah like do they mention cloud there
57:36 like then if they don't maybe
57:38 they don't have it yet
57:40 yeah so if they
57:42 yeah although asking people to be
57:44 experts in aws for a data scientist job
57:47 is also something like a little bit you
57:49 know
57:50 because in the end it's like um
57:55 like you can learn it right
57:57 yes
57:58 so
57:59 uh
58:00 if you have people to learn it from
58:01 right so
58:03 so yeah so basically i think
58:05 you
58:06 know
58:08 and maybe it's mentioned in the job
58:09 description that they already have data
58:11 engineering like they can kind of
58:13 um mention like the structure of the
58:15 department
58:18 and if it's not mentioned then you can
58:20 use something or other
58:22 inks in ink think you can you also do
58:25 this like for a company can you see what
58:27 kind of uh people work there like the
58:29 titles all that yeah i think so yeah you
58:31 can also basically i can see what kind
58:33 of jobs the people on linkedin thing or
58:36 whatnot have there right
58:38 and if they don't have like the website
58:40 of the company like this is of course
58:42 for larger companies for smaller
58:44 companies
58:45 sometimes you hear this we don't care
58:46 about titles
58:49 is it a good thing or not right like
58:51 depends
58:52 exactly it depends
58:55 yeah and uh one more thing maybe to
58:57 check if the company is doing any talks
58:59 on conferences do they have like attack
59:01 block i think this is also a good
59:03 indicator that they
59:04 want to share knowledge
59:06 okay i think that would be it for today
59:09 uh do you want to
59:11 maybe you forgot to mention anything uh
59:14 during today uh
59:16 like is there anything you want to say
59:17 before we wrap up
59:19 i know just that uh well maybe that the
59:21 talk uh like say you're mentioning is on
