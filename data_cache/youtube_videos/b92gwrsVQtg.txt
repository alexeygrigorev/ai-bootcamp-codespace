0:40 a pinned link in the live chat. So ask
0:43 your questions there and we will be
0:44 covering these questions during the
0:46 interview.
0:48 That's the usual intro. I haven't done
0:50 it in a while cuz we've been uh I was on
0:53 the break. Uh but now it's back to
0:56 school time. So now we are also back to
0:59 our usual activities
1:02 and um right now I'm opening the
1:04 document with the questions.
1:08 Um
1:09 so Daniel are you ready to start?
1:12 Oh yes I am.
1:13 Yeah. So let's start. This week we'll
1:16 discuss uh astronomy applied machine
1:18 learning and how you can move from one
1:20 to another. We have a very special guest
1:22 today Danielle. Daniel is an
1:24 astrophysicist, turned machine learning
1:26 engineer and AI ambassador. Um he is a
1:29 PhD candidate at the University of Cape
1:31 Town. He builds end to end systems and
1:33 LM applications with a focus on
1:35 relability and monitoring. His recent
1:37 work spans knowledge retrieval
1:38 assistance, evaluation, observability,
1:41 applying data science to space uh
1:43 weather and multi-wavelength astronomy.
1:47 So this is really cool. I am really
1:49 excited to talk about all these topics.
1:51 Um so welcome to uh our event.
1:55 Thank you Alexing.
1:57 Yeah. Um usually the first thing I ask
2:00 about um is about your career um uh so
2:05 far but recently uh I don't know if you
2:08 observed this in the southern
2:10 hemisphere. Recently we had a lunar
2:13 eclipse and it was very very cool
2:15 because we had this full moon but then
2:18 the next night I see and I see the moon
2:20 is not full and I'm like okay this is
2:22 strange like it's supposed to gradually
2:24 decrease but all of a sudden it's just
2:26 like a little piece of the moon and I'm
2:27 like what's happening? But then it turns
2:29 red and I'm like oh my god what's what's
2:32 going on? So I asked JPT how can moon be
2:36 red and then GPT says yeah it can be
2:39 during moon
2:41 eclipse and like okay when is the next
2:44 when is the next lunar eclipse and it
2:46 says yeah by the way it's actually today
2:47 and I'm like wow it was so cool and now
2:50 we talk about astronomy I don't know
2:53 anything about astronomy except this
2:55 lunar eclipse um thing cuz I witnessed
2:59 with my own eyes that the moon can turn
3:02 red This is awesome. And I've been to um
3:06 our planetarium in Berlin here in Berlin
3:08 a few times. So that's my knowledge of
3:10 astronomy. So I'm really excited about
3:12 this talk today cuz uh for me this is
3:14 always interesting but I don't know much
3:16 about this. So pretty cool.
3:18 Well, thank you very much. Also uh on my
3:21 side I'm going to say thank you again to
3:23 you because um uh over the years you
3:27 have been running this data talks club
3:29 and to be honest there's been a lot of
3:30 value that been get from it um
3:32 especially with this concurrent courses
3:35 that runs from January to end of the
3:37 year. So I sometimes I wonder how you do
3:39 that like how you able to run the things
3:41 organize podcast bring people to talk
3:44 about the new you know new software
3:47 development you know and all that. So
3:49 kudos to you as well for for pulling
3:52 that off.
3:53 Yeah. Well, it's kind of my job now. So
3:56 before it wasn't so I was a data
3:58 scientist, but now it's my job. So
4:00 that's how I managed to do all that. But
4:02 today we're talking about you Daniel. Um
4:05 so uh let's start with your background.
4:07 Can you tell us about your career
4:09 journey so far?
4:10 Well, my career journey just like you
4:12 said, I'm a PhD candidate at University
4:14 of Cape Town. I only came to South
4:16 Africa because of my PhD. uh I did my
4:19 undergrad masters in Nigeria and then um
4:23 after co I got a scholarship to come do
4:26 my PhD here at South Africa at the
4:28 University of Cape Town also at the one
4:31 of the institutes here called the South
4:32 Africa astronomy observatory. So
4:34 generally my work is on um leveraging
4:38 what we call mult
4:40 strategy to find radio emitting stars.
4:43 So um all of us know that stars is
4:45 something that we see very common in the
4:46 sky with our neck and eyes. But that is
4:49 because um stars are very good at
4:51 radiating in the optical wavelength
4:53 which our eyes can see. But if you go um
4:56 towards the lower frequency regime of
4:58 the electromagnet electromagnetic
5:00 spectrum it becomes very difficult to
5:02 speak of stars to see stars. So u
5:05 recently um there's a current project
5:08 global project or international project
5:10 going on now called the square kilometer
5:12 array. So the quest square kilometer
5:14 array is one of those I would say
5:16 gigantic science missions to build
5:20 arrays of telescopes radio telescopes um
5:24 is going to be hosted by two countries
5:25 South Africa and um Australia. So in the
5:30 course of that project, South Africa did
5:32 and they got the um the hosting rights
5:34 to host a part of the the SK made. So
5:37 that prompted them to build this um
5:39 precursor telescope called MCAT which is
5:41 a 64
5:43 um 64 antenna array sitting in the car
5:47 desert in the northern Cape. So um after
5:50 you know launching the telescope in 2018
5:53 there was this um legacy data set that
5:56 was taken about the galactic plane. So
5:58 the galactic plate is just that patch of
5:59 the sky that is very very dusty. Um if
6:02 you look at the picture you guys using
6:04 my uh for this ad you're going to see in
6:06 that picture a part of the sky what we
6:08 call the Milky Way. So that is the
6:10 galactic plane and in 2018 from 2018 to
6:14 2020 MAT mapped this whole portion of
6:16 the sky and my job is to now take the
6:19 data from meat and find radio emitting
6:22 stars from that data set. So that's
6:25 find what? Sorry.
6:27 Find radio emitting stars.
6:29 Uhhuh.
6:30 Yes.
6:30 So what is it? So I'm a very lay person
6:33 when it comes to these things. So I uh
6:37 physics wasn't my favorite subject for
6:39 some reasons in school. I don't know
6:41 why. I liked mathematics but not
6:43 physics. Um so what does it mean
6:45 electromagnetic spectrum?
6:48 Oh well um so the electromagnetic
6:50 spectrum is basically um the regime by
6:53 which light can emit in. So you have it
6:56 um it can be low frequency, high
6:58 frequency or wavelength related. So it
7:01 spans from radio which we consider low
7:05 frequency to high frequency to like
7:07 gamma ray.
7:09 Yeah. So um so um you have x-ray and
7:12 gamma ray. So these things are quite
7:15 this tells you more like the intensity
7:17 or the energy range of the photon. Yeah.
7:20 So um our eyes can only pick up things
7:22 in um in the optical
7:25 right but um yeah so um but at the same
7:28 time things like um the communication
7:31 channels like radio when you talk about
7:33 antennas Wi-Fi they all operate in the
7:35 radio region um stinking
7:38 telecommunication devices then you begin
7:40 to talk about gammaray you're talking
7:42 about maybe um okay x-ray you can talk
7:45 about x-ray some of these x-ray devices
7:48 and stuff like
7:50 Yeah. So um in astronomy we also build
7:53 receivers. Astronomers also in
7:55 astrophysics you build receivers for the
7:57 picking up these um emissions at
8:00 different wavelength. So in the optical
8:02 you have the most common telescopes and
8:04 the basic ones that you see people buy
8:07 um you can buy from Alibaba, you can buy
8:09 from Amazon. Those are basic ones. And
8:11 also um even um big ones like we have
8:14 here at this uh SEO facility. But then
8:17 things like um radio is not so common.
8:21 So you have to you need to build it in a
8:23 very quiet field because you also want
8:25 to avoid um radio interference from um
8:28 electronic devices or from satellites.
8:31 And then for X-ray
8:33 um it's not so convenient to build um
8:36 them here. So you have to send them to
8:39 space. You have to spend send um you
8:40 know satellites um telescopes in space.
8:43 We have a couple of them um like um the
8:46 most common one is the one from your
8:48 country. Are you from Germany, right?
8:50 Okay. You're based in Germany.
8:51 I'm based in Germany. Yeah.
8:52 Okay. We have the project currently
8:54 ongoing. Um it's a collaboration between
8:56 Russia and Germany. So
8:59 it's also a space telescope that
9:00 operates in the X-ray.
9:03 And James Webb telescope is optic
9:07 um yeah James Webster is also a space
9:09 telescope. Um it it operates in the
9:11 infrared.
9:13 Infrared.
9:14 Yes.
9:15 Okay. So many things. But uh infrared is
9:18 something we don't see, right? So when I
9:19 go out or in Berlin, the sky is not
9:21 really visible. But let's say there is
9:22 not a lot of less light pollution. So I
9:25 go go out, turn my head up and I see
9:29 stars, right? So this is just the usual
9:33 um light waves, right? That go from I
9:36 don't know. Um
9:37 so infrared is quite
9:39 to violet right so the usual range
9:43 so well infrared infrared sits in lower
9:46 more like lower frequency compared to
9:48 the optical but it's very near to the
9:50 optical
9:51 and this electromagnetic spectrum is uh
9:53 we have devices like my my mobile phone
9:56 um like Wi-Fi router but stars also and
9:59 other
10:01 I don't know space bodies they emit some
10:05 Yeah. Yeah.
10:07 in in in multiple wavelengths. Um Yeah.
10:09 But the only thing is that sometimes the
10:10 strength of wavelength is not able to
10:12 reach us here. Yeah.
10:13 It's only optical that usually very very
10:16 um dominant or unless X-ray in the case
10:18 of um maybe black hole systems that like
10:21 black holes you can say oh these are
10:23 very energetic systems. Yeah.
10:25 Mhm. Because black holes they don't emit
10:27 light but they emit something else or
10:29 they don't emit anything. Well, yeah,
10:31 not optical light, but um there's a
10:33 whole lot of activity there that is very
10:34 very energetic. So, with that, we're
10:36 able to pick up um even X-ray and gamray
10:39 events.
10:40 Okay. Okay. Interesting.
10:42 And uh what do you exactly do? So, you
10:46 said there is this mech telescope,
10:48 right? or
10:49 so so what I do is that what I do is
10:50 that we have the ma data the collected
10:53 data of the galactic plane and then and
10:55 then also we would like identify the
10:57 point source or compact source points in
10:59 this object. So our job is to say given
11:02 the fact that we have these data sets,
11:04 uh we need to find how many of them are
11:07 emissions coming from stars and not from
11:09 other um extra galactic or you know
11:13 astrophysical subjects out there because
11:15 usually in the radio you tend to pick up
11:17 mostly extragalactic sources, AGN's
11:21 um galaxies and the rest of them because
11:23 they are very strong in the radio. Yeah.
11:26 So but at the same time we know there a
11:28 couple of stars too that also have
11:30 emissions that we can pick up especially
11:32 with new instrument that are coming up
11:34 like MCAT or in Australia's gap or the
11:37 the um the VA
11:40 okay so your job if I understood so you
11:44 scan the uh the sky at least the Milky
11:47 Way part right and
11:50 so the operation of MCAT was to scan the
11:52 Milky Way part and then get this data
11:54 and then my job is to now take this data
11:56 derived from MCAT and do crossorrelation
11:59 with um other multi wavelength data
12:01 sets.
12:02 Okay. And the task for this particular
12:06 project if I understood correctly. So
12:08 you have this scan of the sky with the
12:10 Milky of the Milky Way and there are
12:13 many sources of uh waves of uh radio
12:19 many detections of sources.
12:20 Yeah. Yeah. So then you need to
12:21 understand if this wave is it coming
12:24 from a star or it's coming from
12:25 something else right.
12:26 Yeah. Exactly. Yes.
12:28 Uhhuh. And you use machine learning for
12:29 that.
12:30 Oh well um not necessarily uh we didn't
12:32 use machine learning for this. Uh we
12:34 used um crossation method which is more
12:36 like you know the nearest concept. Yeah.
12:40 So because you have to also take into
12:41 account the positions in the sky. Um the
12:44 same way um in geography here we know
12:46 our positions on earth using the
12:48 longitude. We also have it for the sky.
12:50 So even though you observing a different
12:52 epoch you need to also you know
12:55 enter in the correct position. So given
12:57 the position that we have with meat we
12:59 go to other instruments like the
13:01 European space agency space telescope
13:03 they also have their own space telescope
13:04 mission called GIA which you think is
13:06 top to operation this year. Um it also
13:08 has its own optical data. So at least
13:10 the one we can see with our eyes. So
13:12 comparing that positions and then we're
13:14 able to align which um
13:18 um which star actually which source
13:21 actually has a common emission or
13:23 detection in these two instruments.
13:26 Why do we need um to look in this
13:29 electromagnetic spectrum? Why is light
13:31 not enough?
13:33 Okay. Well um so like I said we're
13:35 looking for stars and stars are very
13:36 weak in the radio. So but in the optical
13:39 you have a lot of stars
13:40 now to connect. Okay. From the radio the
13:42 emissions um
13:44 into linking the emissions whether it's
13:47 from the same star.
13:48 So this is why you have to also cross
13:50 correlate the positions. So if you
13:52 if you match the positions and you see
13:54 oh this actually falling from the same
13:56 position they begin to check okay
13:59 at least it raises the hype the
14:01 probability that this is this emission
14:03 might actually be coming from the same
14:04 source but that is not enough. you begin
14:06 to think about other possibilities
14:09 because you are dealing with a 2D space.
14:11 You're dealing with a 2D space. You're
14:13 not dealing with a 3D space. So you
14:14 don't have the ST information or or you
14:17 also have a case whereby you can have a
14:19 background and foreground object. Is it
14:22 for example, let's say you have um how I
14:25 say this? So let's say you have this,
14:27 right?
14:28 Then you have this.
14:29 It's a pan. And
14:30 yeah, so you'll be able to see this,
14:31 right? You'll not be able to see this.
14:33 Yeah. But it's also
14:34 for those who are listening this cuz we
14:36 will release this later as audio only
14:38 podcast. You were showing a pen and
14:41 behind the pen there was a piece of
14:43 paper right?
14:44 Yeah. Yeah. So um if you depending on
14:47 your looking you first of all see the
14:48 pen right?
14:49 Yeah.
14:50 Good. And then um um so let's say they
14:53 are of the same if you look at the if
14:55 you if you look at the pen you might
14:58 assume that oh because we are from a far
15:00 distance then the pen and the paper in
15:02 the same position but they not actually
15:03 in the same position I understand.
15:05 Yeah.
15:06 Okay. So this is when we observe light
15:08 only right and the the radio signal may
15:11 tell us that actually like these are
15:13 quite distance object distant object
15:15 just one is on top of like over how to
15:17 say overlays one one covers another
15:20 right
15:20 yeah one covers another
15:22 and in Milky Way I guess it's a common
15:25 problem because we have so many stars
15:27 there
15:27 yeah you have so many stars thank you
15:29 know that
15:30 so you have to now take that into
15:32 account and then um so even just finding
15:34 that things are in the same position is
15:36 not enough. You need to think of the
15:37 physics. Um what are the properties?
15:40 What are the known properties of the
15:41 source based on previous observations
15:43 and then that can help you tie that the
15:45 radio emission is actually coming from
15:46 the source and not from a background
15:49 object.
15:50 Okay.
15:50 Yeah, I understand now. Um when I was to
15:53 I told you at the beginning that I have
15:55 visited the planetarium here in Berlin
15:58 and in the planetarium uh I think the
16:01 the show was about stars. Anyways, so
16:03 they were showing what is um like what
16:06 do we see in what we see in the sky and
16:09 they showed the Milky Way but because
16:11 Milky Way is so dense, we cannot really
16:13 receive the light coming from I don't
16:15 know some galaxies that are behind Milky
16:17 Way. So our map of the universe is
16:21 limited to things outside of Milky Way.
16:25 So from outside of Milky Way, we can
16:27 detect light coming from like some
16:29 galaxies, right? But because Milky Way
16:32 uh covers or hides other things, we
16:35 don't really know what is uh behind the
16:37 Milky Way.
16:38 So, but that's because you are looking
16:39 in the the optical wavelength.
16:41 Yeah.
16:41 So, in the optical wavelength you have
16:43 this um you have this issue
16:45 and um this but in the radio it's a
16:48 different thing all together.
16:50 Yeah. Yeah.
16:50 So, the stars are very dark in the
16:52 radio. So if you you point if you point
16:55 to the same place where I see a lot of
16:56 stars in the radio,
16:58 you're not going to see those stars
16:59 anymore.
17:01 Background objects. Yeah.
17:02 Uhhuh. And potentially with the research
17:06 you're doing, we will be eventually able
17:09 to uh extend the map of the universe we
17:13 currently have uh to include like
17:15 galaxies that are behind Milky Way,
17:17 right? The one
17:18 couple of people. Yes, of course. That
17:20 is what mat was able to achieve with
17:22 those galactic planes. So there are
17:24 people a lot of people looking at those
17:26 background non galactic sources within
17:30 our galaxy.
17:31 Yeah. What my job is to also my job is
17:34 just to look at the data and find
17:36 galactic sources at least the one radio
17:39 stars emitting stars not
17:41 extra galactic.
17:43 Yeah. Very interesting. Very
17:44 interesting. Thank you for sharing. How
17:46 do you use machine learning? Do you use
17:48 it in at your work right now?
17:51 Oh, no. No, not really. Um, but we we're
17:54 building up a data set that could
17:55 actually be very useful for machine
17:57 learning in the future because um, like
17:59 I said, we what we have currently is
18:00 more of observational data. So, you need
18:02 to also build a physics from the
18:05 observational data before diving into
18:07 machine learning.
18:09 Yes, it's more like modeling right now.
18:11 So there's some uh
18:14 data you observed or you collected and
18:18 then you try to uh I don't know use uh
18:20 some formulas from physics to understand
18:22 how this data
18:23 exactly
18:25 you're doing the physics. Yeah. Doing
18:26 the physics is giving the
18:27 interpretations and making sure you're
18:29 getting reliable data because you need
18:31 to enough reliable data to be able to
18:33 find
18:34 Yeah. So let me give you a shocker. Um
18:38 at least we over the years we've had
18:40 both guard and space-based telescopes to
18:42 operate optical. Um like I told you the
18:44 other one is Gaia. They stopped
18:46 operation this year last year.
18:48 Gaia mission had more than 1.8 billion
18:52 um stars.
18:54 Mhm.
18:55 Survey and stars.
18:57 Yeah. Stars in it survey. So this
18:59 telescope was able to map the stars 1.8
19:02 million stars. We have it in the data
19:04 set. And if you look at even in the
19:07 infrared you're going to pick up close
19:10 to a billion stars like two mass wise
19:13 hundreds of billions of stars then even
19:17 um ground space telescope like even um
19:19 CTF and the rest of them but in the
19:22 radio
19:24 we only have few thousands of stars in
19:26 the radio.
19:28 Mhm.
19:28 So you can see it is very very it is
19:30 short until recently it was less than a
19:32 thousand radio stars. less than a
19:35 thousand radio stars. So the reason is
19:38 because um the radio infrastructure is
19:40 not as you know common as we have in the
19:43 optical because these are very these are
19:46 high engineering and again they cost a
19:48 lot to build compared to optical
19:50 telescopes. So but recently um
19:52 investment and ongoing into some of
19:54 these things um also building sensitive
19:57 telescope that is able to pick up even
19:58 very faint detections than microcy. So
20:01 it is now helping astronomers to at
20:03 least um resolve you know potential
20:07 candidates of what we might call um
20:09 radio stars that people have thought
20:10 about that oh given that we've seen this
20:12 emission in the x-ray or in the optical
20:14 this kind of behavior we're expecting
20:16 that there should also be a radio
20:17 emission coming from the star right yeah
20:20 for the nearby universe or within our
20:22 solar neighbor we should be able to pick
20:24 up some of these things and that is what
20:26 the old escape pre telescopes are doing
20:28 with right now um like I say mircat in
20:30 South Africa
20:32 Scap in Australia and V mission in the
20:35 US.
20:37 Okay. So right now it's a few thousand
20:40 of stars only but with the investment in
20:44 uh the hardware and technology
20:47 um we should be able to observe more and
20:50 more stars with this uh
20:52 radio stars. Yeah, radio stars
20:55 because again this these things do also
20:57 they do also they do other science
20:58 project not just for stars they dominate
21:01 dominating field in radio galactic like
21:05 a
21:07 um um even um galaxies you know extended
21:11 objects remnants and the rest of them
21:14 just things outside of our galaxy.
21:16 Mhm.
21:17 Yeah. But um how did you actually so you
21:20 said what you use right now at work is
21:23 more like statistics correlation uh than
21:26 also physics more like traditional
21:28 modeling uh at what point and how did
21:31 you come across machine learning and
21:33 decided to use it?
21:34 Well um so coming across machine
21:36 learning was um a thing that um happened
21:38 sometime like say I'll say probably
21:41 during my masters or so. So um I will
21:44 say this I I have a friend who who who
21:48 is an engineer. We also grew up together
21:51 in Nigeria and then he left for Canada
21:53 some time and was able to build um uh so
21:58 he studied electrical electronics
21:59 engineering and then he he was able to
22:02 build this AI startup called
22:05 um way back in um
22:07 yeah I'll say sometime around 2015 16
22:11 and it was um
22:12 an AI you know then wasn't AI wasn't
22:15 necessarily like a trend and stuff so AI
22:18 that was infant asphysia. So this
22:22 happens by analyzing the infant cries of
22:25 babies, you know.
22:26 So you're able to use that to predict if
22:30 a child if an infant has physia. So um
22:33 it became a motivating factor but at the
22:35 time it wasn't necessarily my thing but
22:39 um getting into doing this program I
22:42 realized that I need to do a lot of
22:45 data. I need to like I short I have a
22:47 lot of data and this data is actually
22:48 very very huge. You're talking about
22:50 tens of gigabytes. So you're not able to
22:52 process it on your PC you need a cloud
22:54 you need a cluster to process this data.
22:56 So that is where the whole
22:58 um data science concept came in. Mhm.
23:01 So when I started my program at the same
23:03 time there was um an announcement a
23:05 program called
23:08 um um black and brilliant AI program um
23:12 organized by some people in the US and
23:15 also in collaboration with code academy
23:17 because I was also struggling to learn
23:19 you know um how to code
23:22 in Python you know how to do data
23:24 analysis because I didn't I'm going to
23:26 deal with a lot of data
23:27 and you need to get hands on in all of
23:30 this. So I applied for that program and
23:33 then I got accepted and in about three
23:36 months we had this whole coding phase
23:39 with code academi is the platform and
23:42 also provided me with a couple of
23:43 mentors. So
23:44 with that we're able to interact there
23:46 were also conversations around machine
23:48 learning because a good number of them
23:49 are practitioners already like in the
23:52 industry tech industry not some of them
23:54 are not necessly doing machine learning
23:55 but they are like you know things
23:57 related to machine learning. So one of
23:59 my mentors who happens to be um was also
24:03 in machine learning person like said oh
24:05 motivated about how data science is I
24:09 already know the impact of data science
24:10 in my field but he was also trying to
24:12 like butress why I should not look at it
24:14 from the prism of astronomy alone but
24:15 also look at it from the prism of the
24:17 fact that I'm able to understand the
24:19 concept of data analysis and also
24:22 employing
24:24 um programming tools into it because
24:27 again the idea was that if you're able
24:29 to do this successfully within your
24:31 academic field, you can also do it. It's
24:33 also the same paradigm in the industry.
24:35 So that become that became a motivator
24:38 and um um at least that I started also
24:42 getting my hands dirty and instead of
24:44 using some software to do the cross
24:46 matching or crossorrelation um I started
24:49 using um Astropi. So in a we have a
24:52 Python package called Astropy. It is
24:54 very very robust. It actually
24:56 incorporates um I'm going to say it
24:58 incorporates a number of things from
25:01 um haz
25:03 um numpy
25:05 to even start um um yeah sci all
25:09 together bonding into one. So
25:12 I'm looking at it right now.
25:14 Yeah. So it's um
25:15 yeah it's a it's the go package for
25:18 doing anything astronomy related in
25:20 Python. So uh I started you know trying
25:23 that out started combining my data with
25:27 um nonpi because like I said the data
25:29 was very very huge. So even using pandas
25:31 was
25:32 was not going to work but as to pi
25:34 allows like you know the whole
25:36 flexibility of dealing with big data and
25:38 all that. So I started seeing how I
25:40 could actually manage all of these
25:42 things together. So that's where the
25:44 whole thing like oh this actually
25:45 beautiful I could do this and I'm also
25:47 glad that I didn't have to also run
25:48 these things on my PC.
25:50 had access to like a free a cloud
25:52 service or cluster where I could just
25:54 run things on a Jupyter hub and you know
25:56 keep running day to day and then yeah
26:00 but then um in 2022 that's when I think
26:05 I saw I think it was one of the mentors
26:07 who reshared your post about your
26:10 advertisement for MLOps.
26:12 Mhm.
26:14 Of course data initially it was data
26:16 engineering.
26:17 Okay.
26:17 Yeah. Data engineering. So this was
26:19 January 2022. So I signed up for the
26:22 It was the first one, the first.
26:24 Yeah. So I signed up for the data
26:26 engineering. But at the time I was
26:27 traveling. So I wasn't available to do
26:29 all of that because again I was just
26:30 starting in Python, you know, there were
26:32 a lot of things now like heavy and I'm
26:34 talking about cloud. I'm like okay
26:37 you know terraform and the rest of them
26:39 like but one of the the the motivation
26:42 at the time was that I was not stable.
26:44 So I was just trying to do and um you
26:46 know trying I was traveling and then at
26:49 the same time uh you know I was just
26:50 studying my PhD. So I need to like get
26:53 to do some get some results and get my
26:56 hands dirty. So I had to skip it. Then
26:58 later that year that's when the ML zoom
27:01 came in. I had to take the ML zoom and
27:04 yeah I would say that was um
27:07 the eye opener on the machine learning
27:08 perspective. So when I eventually um
27:12 when I eventually finished the emission
27:15 learning course like I think for more
27:17 than is it eight or 10 weeks and um one
27:20 of the rule was that you need to share
27:22 your learnings online. So I was sharing
27:25 and one of the reasons why I was sharing
27:26 is because a lot of the people who were
27:28 my mentors or part of people who were
27:29 mentors in the black and brilliant they
27:31 were all on we connected on LinkedIn. So
27:32 most times I ask questions really those
27:34 who have background in like science and
27:36 machine learning. So um so they started
27:39 seeing what I was doing right and so
27:42 with that they like oh you're doing a
27:45 good job. So they keep encouragement
27:46 sometimes one of them will send me a
27:48 message on WhatsApp. Oh I see what
27:49 you're doing. Keep it up. Keep it up.
27:50 You're doing
27:51 that's really cool.
27:53 Yeah. So that's how the whole team
27:55 start. I'm like are you serious? This
27:56 thing I'm doing I'm think I'm just
27:57 trying to like get my hands dirty and
27:59 then somebody is like telling you you're
28:01 doing a good job. So that's just where
28:02 the whole machine learning
28:04 thing I would say kicked in fully. Yeah.
28:07 Mhm. So, you took it in 2022, right?
28:12 The ML course.
28:13 Yes.
28:14 Uhhuh. Cool. It was I think our second
28:16 edition of ML Zoom Camp.
28:20 That's really cool. Yeah. Thanks for
28:23 sharing that. Um, does it help you like
28:27 u because you said you don't really use
28:29 machine learning, you use other things.
28:31 Well, I'm wondering if
28:34 what you learned is very help is helpful
28:36 at your work.
28:38 Yeah, of course it is helpful. So, okay,
28:40 first and foremost, um let's not even
28:42 just talk about the machine learning
28:44 aspect. You talk about like the paradigm
28:46 shift in the coding experience itself
28:48 because initially when I started
28:50 learning Python and even like whole data
28:53 analysis, data science, it's mostly
28:55 everything is just done on the Jupyter
28:56 notebook, right? Mhm.
28:59 Um even um like I said even testing
29:02 getting my hands dirty on the on the
29:05 Jupyter hub server that we have.
29:06 Everything runs on Jupyter notebook. But
29:08 taking the MLOps camp allowed me to now
29:12 shift from just writing codes in Jupyter
29:14 notebook like writing Python scripts
29:17 that are reusable, right? That can be
29:19 used for like doing other task later.
29:21 Because let me tell you something. It's
29:22 really in in the whole whole lot of the
29:24 science field is a lot of people don't
29:27 unlike maybe computer scientist a lot of
29:29 people don't learn Python like from a
29:33 developer perspective.
29:34 Mhm.
29:35 They just learn for doing their basic um
29:38 task right okay I'm a scientist I need
29:40 to do this analysis maybe I need to do
29:42 this plot I just do it in a Jupyter
29:43 notebook. The lazy way of doing things
29:45 and it stops there. Even senior
29:48 researchers or stuff they only just know
29:50 how to do the whole jupiter because this
29:51 is not like a you know the UI thing
29:54 where you can just see your results save
29:55 them and then you go away. So the ML
29:58 zoom cam were like an eye opener to say
30:00 no actually you need to think about
30:04 developing your project think about
30:08 implementing models that can be used in
30:11 real life or like in the industry or for
30:13 in France just like you say. So that is
30:15 where the whole idea you know crept in
30:18 and that's when I started doing the
30:19 whole like GitHub repo projects
30:23 writing script and you know sharing them
30:25 and this making them reusable and the
30:27 rest of them so yeah I think that was
30:29 also very very essential like I said
30:32 then the introduction to cloud service
30:34 right because I know even though here we
30:36 have the data cluster it's also a cloud
30:38 service but doesn't even have an idea
30:41 what happens behind the scene you
30:42 understand and also how to do all that
30:44 because it's all set up in a way that
30:46 you just go and jump in. So those some
30:50 of those steps that you have to do you
30:52 know even terraform even doing things in
30:55 the cloud where you have to like even
30:57 set up like virtual environments or
30:59 setting up your doa in a cloud. So those
31:01 are like small add-ons even though I
31:04 know in astronomy we tend to use a lot
31:06 of Linux a lot because we also have
31:07 other softwares that allows you. So I
31:09 was very familiar with doing the bash
31:10 scripting right but not like doing
31:14 Python scripts and just calling them
31:17 over and over again. Yeah. So those are
31:19 some of the those are some of the
31:21 takeaways.
31:22 Yeah. But um in addition
31:26 it also opened a lot of opportunity to
31:28 me because um in 2023 you know um open
31:32 AI came up with their chat right in 22
31:35 and then in mid 2023
31:38 one of the mentors reached out to me and
31:40 say they see you progressing very well
31:42 especially when I finished the ML zoom
31:44 course and to got a certificate so I
31:45 shared it and then it was reached out to
31:47 me and say would you be willing to work
31:48 on an ML project um as an intern I'm
31:51 like what he said. Well, I understand
31:54 you're you're a student. Um I don't want
31:56 to distract you, but this is just going
31:57 to be like um um something minor. A few
32:00 hours um a month we can make
32:03 arrangements so that it doesn't affect
32:05 you. Like okay, that's a good deal.
32:07 So because he was setting up a
32:08 consulting company in the US and that's
32:11 how we kickstarted. So my job was to
32:13 just to do
32:15 um testing out um deployment of Intel um
32:22 you know there's this um Intel product
32:24 called open veno for edge devices. So
32:27 the idea then was to see how
32:29 it's some computer vision uh yes so the
32:34 idea was to test out a couple of the
32:36 models um you have I forgotten all of
32:39 them now. This was way back. So you know
32:41 package them and deploy them on Intel um
32:44 Intel cloud Intel so Intel hardware they
32:47 do have a couple of GPUs at the time or
32:50 their own set of hardware CPU their
32:53 different sort of comput resource so
32:54 that is what I was doing because he
32:56 worked with Intel so more like okay we
32:59 need you to do this we need to test this
33:01 things out and that's how I started
33:02 doing it I saying well getting the
33:03 essence of how you know um you need to
33:06 actually deploy stuff um on your in like
33:10 different set of hardware. Think about
33:12 and latency and the rest of them and
33:14 even figuring out okay what is the right
33:16 um um infrastructure for deploying your
33:20 service. So we did that and um it
33:24 worked. So I I usually just run the
33:26 whole the typing and then just hand it
33:29 over to to him because he has other
33:32 people in the team. So my job was just
33:34 to quickly test out something and then
33:36 later on lang chain came into the scene
33:38 and then you know people started talking
33:40 about AI LLM and the rest. So he he said
33:44 I know you just started doing machine
33:46 learning AI deep learning is not
33:47 something that you're very good at but
33:49 if you think you want to test the waters
33:51 you can check out it. He did share me a
33:54 couple of resources. Have you heard
33:55 about launch? I said well I'm not so
33:57 sure. I was like about it. So I started
33:58 reading about it was like oh
34:01 because then I wasn't paying attention
34:03 to that area. So now I realized that
34:05 okay oh we're now in an era where you
34:08 can actually use these models especially
34:09 the open source models hugging face you
34:12 know try them out.
34:13 like okay get hugging face API and then
34:16 started trying things by myself and so
34:19 that's how that whole step started into
34:22 moving from classical machine learning
34:24 to thinking about AI application like um
34:28 LLM prompting and um um essentially rag
34:33 uh application thinking about embedding
34:35 thinking about vector database and the
34:37 rest of them so we're just always
34:38 prototyping as new products coming or
34:41 new frameworks coming because they were
34:42 like you need to get a sense of also
34:44 testing on their infrastructure and
34:46 maybe see for also some of the um maybe
34:50 I'll say clients he was servicing with
34:52 his consulting company. So I was going
34:54 through all of these things and to be
34:55 honest it was it was challenging at the
34:57 same time it was fun because you know
34:59 somebody trusting you even when you
35:00 don't necessarily have like technical
35:02 knowhow you know at least uh to do all
35:05 of these things. So it became
35:07 so it became more of a a thing. Yeah.
35:11 until at some point we had to stop when
35:13 Intel's problem you know the time Intel
35:15 had to um there's a lot of issues I
35:18 think last year meaning it was a detain
35:20 in the news so we had to stop and then I
35:23 had to go back to uh my studies because
35:27 I was so thinking about okay after all
35:28 of this um research or analysis that
35:31 I've done we need to put them in a paper
35:33 this academic paper so I have to like
35:36 um you know stop that and until Yeah.
35:41 LED again like
35:42 gradation.
35:43 Yeah. Yes. We needed to like you know do
35:46 all that. So that's just how my journey
35:49 has been in the space.
35:50 Yeah. That's uh pretty cool. And did I
35:53 understand you correctly that uh they
35:56 reached out to you because you were
35:58 sharing your progress during the course.
36:01 They saw you on LinkedIn and then at
36:03 some point when they had a project they
36:05 reached out to you saying I think you
36:07 say 2023 May they reached out to you
36:10 saying hey do you want to work on this
36:12 thing?
36:13 Oh yes like I said because we um I
36:15 already knew this person as a mentor
36:17 during the black and brilliant. So while
36:20 I was sharing my progress on the on
36:23 LinkedIn he was like okay I see you're
36:25 now taking machine learning seriously. I
36:27 did get like message like good job and
36:30 one again one of the reasons why I was
36:31 sharing my learning this thing then on
36:33 LinkedIn was because I know I follow
36:35 them. I also wanted the people in my
36:37 circle who I think are way better to
36:39 also maybe share their thoughts about
36:40 what um maybe what I need to do because
36:43 that's what I usually do then maybe if
36:45 I'm learning something I can maybe reach
36:47 out to somebody I think please what do
36:49 you think about this? Do you think it's
36:50 a waste of time? Do you think it's worth
36:51 it? So, so I got that encouragement a
36:54 few times and then in May it was like
36:56 okay if you can do this project then you
36:59 can can you do this or you can if you
37:01 want to try you understand.
37:03 Yeah.
37:03 Yeah. That's that's really cool
37:06 cuz uh in our courses we usually uh
37:10 encourage uh course participants to
37:12 share in public but uh many don't do.
37:17 many still continue doing this uh
37:20 silently which is okay not everyone
37:22 wants to share but I want to encourage
37:24 as many people as possible and your
37:26 story is really good so it um if you
37:30 don't mind uh I want to use your story
37:33 to encourage students to say to to share
37:36 things uh to share their learnings
37:37 publicly
37:38 yeah I do to be honest I I I I I
37:42 tell people to do that a lot these days
37:44 because I'm also mentoring people So um
37:47 irrespective of how basic what
37:48 everything you've done just
37:51 just say it no matter how it just say
37:53 because again um it doesn't have to be
37:56 about praises or people telling you well
37:59 done
37:59 it should also be about somebody might
38:01 actually just make a suggestion to you.
38:03 I've seen a post where somebody have
38:05 made something I feel like I see this is
38:06 a beginner I made a suggestion to them
38:08 you understand. So um I know there was
38:11 um somebody who was just trying to share
38:14 something around um
38:17 machine learning was just a beginner
38:19 asking questions. So I was reading this
38:20 blah blah blah. I said you know what go
38:23 to YouTube go and search for ML of Zoom
38:25 camp.
38:26 So actually have I like encouraged a lot
38:28 of people to enroll directly into the
38:31 zoom camp. Why? because it's important
38:33 that you
38:36 that you learn the best practices which
38:38 is something that I think was missing
38:41 then most times if you go to things like
38:43 cosera and stuff you don't see the sort
38:45 of foundational thing like the whole end
38:47 to end process you understand so
38:50 everybody can come and teach you teaches
38:52 you machine learning teaches you okay oh
38:55 you need to do um you know the sort of
38:58 um functions you need to call type of
39:00 models But then nobody talks about
39:04 deployment,
39:05 right? Yeah. Nobody talks about
39:07 deployment. People then like MLOps
39:09 because again even though remember you
39:11 didn't necessarily call the ML Zoom camp
39:14 an MLOps thing but at least it was uh it
39:17 was this was a a a
39:20 call it it's an end to end project
39:22 right?
39:22 Yeah.
39:23 Yeah. because you're able to like train
39:24 your model, evaluate the performance of
39:26 your model and then you deploy it which
39:29 is not something that was so common at
39:31 the time especially for like for free
39:32 resources online. It wasn't something
39:34 common and I felt like um instead of
39:37 wasting a lot of time you can people can
39:39 actually come you know do this because
39:41 this is how you actually enhance your
39:42 programming skills
39:44 doing those tough um tough tasks because
39:46 at the end of the day it's a pattern
39:49 right? If you're able to figure out the
39:50 pattern then things will be able to
39:52 move.
39:54 Yeah. Yeah. That's why when thinking
39:58 about the course I really wanted to make
40:00 sure this is a machine learning
40:03 engineering course. So we have a lot of
40:05 we cover a lot of deployment strategies.
40:08 We talk about deployment cuz many
40:10 courses don't and then people who
40:12 graduate from these courses they go to
40:14 work and then they need to deploy a
40:15 project and then they feel stuck. So in
40:18 order and I saw this uh with my own
40:20 eyes. So that's why I thought it's
40:22 really good to create a course that
40:24 focuses on that.
40:26 Oh and I also took I also took the
40:28 recent MLOps.
40:30 Okay. Okay. Good.
40:31 I just so I in that case I I didn't have
40:34 enough time because these days I'm also
40:36 very busy. So if I tell you I only just
40:38 take those courses during the weekend
40:41 and did the project. I was like no I
40:43 need to do the projects. So I did the
40:45 project and make sure I was able to get
40:46 myself.
40:48 So but I didn't share a lot of things.
40:50 In short, I'm not sure I even shared
40:51 everything online because I was also
40:53 like very very
40:54 um on a very tight schedule. Again, I
40:57 didn't want to also share it to draw
40:58 attention like you've lived your
40:59 academics and you're doing this at this
41:01 critical time.
41:04 So uh there are sometimes cases when you
41:08 don't want to share your rolling in
41:10 public, right?
41:12 Well, yeah, of course. Especially if you
41:14 are you are uh yeah I recommend majority
41:18 of the time you should but like in my
41:20 case the reason why I didn't share it
41:22 then was that I
41:23 I was in between a couple of projects
41:25 and you don't want to feel like you have
41:26 a divided attention but again
41:30 desired I need to actually do that
41:32 course and get the certificate so that's
41:35 lingered for months 2023 when I got the
41:38 ML zoom I bought the next certificate I
41:41 was like no I have to do this I I
41:43 actually registered the in the data
41:46 engineering zoom camp at the beginning
41:48 of the year. I actually went through it
41:50 end to end. The only problem was that I
41:52 didn't put I didn't submit I didn't
41:54 submit the project like I didn't even
41:57 though I did project because uh
41:59 beginning of the year too was like I
42:00 usually like have this activities a lot
42:03 of activities like volunteer engagement
42:05 and all that at the beginning of the
42:06 year even observation time sometimes we
42:08 like sometime which is also what like
42:10 you know you have to use the telescope
42:12 sometimes like do observation run for
42:14 like weeks so you you're walk during the
42:18 day and you need to pay attention to
42:21 observation. So those times are not
42:23 usually convenient for me to do
42:26 any other things. Yeah.
42:27 Yeah. Well, if you'll have a bit of free
42:29 time, you can just submit your project
42:31 in the next the next iteration, not do
42:34 any course, just focus on
42:35 Oh, yeah. Okay. I I actually just did
42:38 another one this time using a flow. Um
42:41 Okay. Yeah.
42:45 The whole thing all integrated.
42:48 Yeah.
42:49 Yeah. Can you tell us about uh any of
42:52 the projects you did for the courses?
42:54 Maybe like for example this one um
42:58 it's I don't know if it's for a course
43:00 or not but the one you mentioned right
43:01 now airflow and minio uh is so yeah so
43:05 it is recently yeah so I
43:08 so I because I usually just sit down
43:10 sometimes I say what are the unfinished
43:12 project that I did
43:14 and what is more relevant. So during the
43:16 editor engineering zoom camp the one at
43:18 the beginning of the year. remember the
43:20 orchestration was Kestra
43:22 and I did use Kestra and I did the whole
43:25 thing of running the whole
43:28 process from using Terraform to create
43:31 your compost your
43:33 big query because we use Google right
43:36 and then um setting things up and make
43:37 sure they are running and also um
43:40 querying data doing the ELC
43:42 transformation and putting them in
43:44 Google query uh bigquery and I use
43:48 Kestra for
43:50 But then I was speaking to somebody like
43:51 I said sometimes I like to like consult
43:53 with people in the industry to figure
43:54 out what's actually the major trend. So
43:56 it was like
43:57 was telling me no um a flow is still the
44:00 number one orchestrator for um for you
44:03 know running this thing. I was like if
44:05 you can try I'm like okay I think I've
44:08 tried a flow for once but I didn't sure
44:10 I'm not sure I did I understood what was
44:12 happening. So I just sit down um last
44:15 weekend. You won't believe it. And then
44:18 I like okay setting up a flow 3.0. And
44:22 to be honest, thanks to there was a pres
44:24 thanks to
44:26 there was one of the uh presenters in
44:28 the in one of your show. I don't know if
44:31 it's what's called again who talk about
44:33 a flow 3.0.
44:35 Mhm. Yeah. Yeah.
44:36 So that's that's one of the resources I
44:38 used. You believe it to just set up the
44:40 the Aflow 3.0 zero on a da
44:44 right this is the command line you use
44:46 this command line utility from
44:47 astronomer for setting up
44:49 oh yeah yeah so actually I tried using
44:51 it but unfortunately uh I didn't succeed
44:54 because I was trying to connect spark
44:56 okay
44:57 the other things to um I don't know I
45:00 think like I said I was in a hurry but I
45:02 figured out how to like do all of those
45:04 things with um just to compose without
45:07 using but I think the CLI is very very
45:10 nice to set things up And
45:12 yeah, but yeah, finally if you get
45:13 everything worked right night last
45:15 night, the whole end to end my SQL. So I
45:19 did the whole thing of think about quing
45:21 the data from a source, right? And
45:22 putting it in your data warehouse. So in
45:25 this case uh I didn't want to connect to
45:26 a cloud service although I know how to
45:28 do that but I had to use M IO to um
45:31 simulate the the
45:34 data link sorry. Yeah. So take data
45:38 using um my SQL put it into min.io
45:41 and then also do um ispark
45:45 transformation and then also save it mio
45:48 and then take the data from min.io
45:49 transform data to pos like where you
45:53 have like analytics.
45:55 Yeah. So what I still have to do now is
45:57 to employ dbt.
46:00 Mhm.
46:00 Okay.
46:01 Yeah. You're almost done. and then you
46:03 can just submit this uh when we start
46:06 the course and then you'll get your
46:07 certificate.
46:08 Oh yeah yeah yeah I'm actually thinking
46:10 of doing writing a maybe probably think
46:13 of writing my first medium article
46:15 because I haven't I've not written
46:16 medium article I know I've written
46:17 something on them then because to be
46:20 honest the the whole integration right
46:22 now is not out there like you know
46:25 um incapassing 3.0 zero.
46:28 Yeah, I imagine that it wasn't super
46:30 straightforward.
46:31 Yeah, I was searching on YouTube. I I
46:33 couldn't figure out I couldn't find so I
46:35 had to struggle but n I figured out how
46:36 to work. So I think this is going to be
46:38 one of those things that
46:39 Yeah, please do. You'll save time to
46:41 many people. But this is also kind of
46:43 the essence of of the data engineer job
46:47 because you have some things you need to
46:49 figure out how they work together and
46:50 sometimes you spend a lot of time doing
46:52 that.
46:54 Yeah. So it was a combination of looking
46:56 at many mostly people using airflow 2.0
47:00 and then um because that's where you see
47:01 a lot of them use by spark but then the
47:03 3.0 there's a whole lot of glitching
47:07 so I had to take my time to figure that
47:10 out. Yeah writing the ta compose also
47:13 setting environmental variables and
47:15 parameters inflow
47:17 web server to make sure things work.
47:19 Yeah. So it's just one of those you know
47:21 learning phases that we um we just do
47:24 especially when I feel like not like I
47:26 have time but when I feel like I have my
47:28 free time
47:29 I just hop in. Then other things that I
47:32 do I think and
47:33 is also
47:36 there something I probably recommend is
47:39 especially now that we have this whole
47:41 AI thing. Um there's a lot of startups
47:44 coming up especially those building um
47:46 you know um conventional frameworks like
47:50 you know lang chain lama index mon have
47:53 even you know many of these things they
47:55 also have their own academy so I think
47:57 sometimes you have this sort of best
47:59 practices where they kind of like you
48:02 know offer tailored trainings know you
48:05 know
48:06 that fits in with how to use their tools
48:08 effectively so I also saw this um an guy
48:11 who I saw for the data data talk post
48:15 this morning about um um learning a flow
48:19 3.0 which I signed up for. I believe
48:21 those who are interested in data
48:22 engineering should take that kind of
48:24 course. Those who are interested in AI
48:26 should look out for um AI related
48:29 courses. Um especially from
48:32 especially if you want to be a developer
48:33 from a developer perspective, look out
48:35 for the academy like Arise AI. They do
48:37 have their own academy for those who
48:38 want to learn how to do um obser um
48:42 observability within the LLM space.
48:44 Yeah. Or take the lang chain um academy.
48:47 They do have um I think about two
48:49 courses now around agents land graph
48:52 rest of them. So I think it's it's more
48:54 like um
48:56 for me that's more like the best um bet.
48:59 And then there a couple of resources too
49:00 that are out there. Uh one of the things
49:03 that have helped me is um you know
49:06 NVIDIA deep learning institute.
49:08 Mhm.
49:09 Yeah. So um they do offer um you know
49:13 courses around um so thinking about
49:16 especially around leveraging NVIDIA
49:19 hardway. So they try to like their
49:21 courses around you thinking about the
49:23 hard way thinking about best practices
49:26 and also
49:27 deploying. So I was lucky enough so one
49:31 of the mentors that I have just was able
49:34 to offset that for me um getting me a
49:37 coupon for one of their courses. Some of
49:38 the courses are also free. Yeah. Some of
49:40 the are free. Yeah. So they also like
49:43 that
49:44 essential
49:45 with Nvidia. I remember they often uh
49:48 give coupons for free. So I remember
49:50 partnering with them uh for they do this
49:55 conference. I don't remember how it's
49:56 called. They do it once or twice per
49:58 year.
49:58 BTC
49:59 PTC. Exactly. And they usually want to
50:02 promote the conference. That's why they
50:04 contact people on LinkedIn with some
50:07 number of followers. They contacted me
50:09 too and say okay like here are coupons
50:11 you can share them with your followers.
50:13 So I was doing that.
50:14 So some yeah just watch out maybe check
50:18 social from time to time.
50:20 Yeah social they have this website for
50:23 higher institutions. So they have this
50:25 some of their courses um especially
50:27 those special ones. Um they usually do
50:30 it at certain times of the year. So you
50:32 always you see the trainings that they
50:35 have and you can sign up free as a
50:36 student. just use your student email. So
50:38 that has helped me a lot to take a
50:40 number of their courses like the recent
50:42 one I did was the conversational AI
50:44 building conversational AI application
50:46 deploying it using the Nvidia name
50:49 infrastructure deploying on um on the on
50:54 Nvidia GPU hardware be it a 100 or H100
50:57 designing the whole kubernetes um
51:01 that's yami templates and the rest of
51:03 them and then deploying so these are
51:05 very very essential especially for
51:06 students to have an email address. Your
51:09 student email address can get you a lot
51:11 of stuff.
51:12 Mhm. Okay. Yeah. There are a few
51:14 questions. The first question I see is
51:16 when to can we register for 2026 batch.
51:20 The question is about date engineering
51:21 course. I shared the link. Uh it does
51:24 say 2025 simply because I did not update
51:28 the date. So you just sign up for 2025
51:30 link and it's fine. Um yeah. Um but then
51:36 we also have a questions to you
51:37 Danielle. So the question is for a data
51:40 beginner what works in the field and how
51:42 to approach um how to even approach
51:46 doing projects there and I guess you
51:49 were there a couple of years ago. Um so
51:52 how did you approach
51:55 being a beginner and starting to
51:58 actually um getting things done? Okay.
52:01 So, yeah, that's a good question, but
52:03 I'm going to answer it this way. Um, I I
52:06 borrowed your templates, um, Alexi. Uh,
52:09 so like I said, a lot of people in
52:12 astronomy, especially for some of us
52:13 coming from developing countries, you
52:15 know, don't even know how to code. So,
52:17 if you want to do a postgraduate
52:18 program, that's when the whole coding
52:20 thing now because scripts in because
52:21 automatically you need it, but then you
52:24 don't have enough time to to like learn
52:27 the skills because remember you're
52:28 already in the middle of your program.
52:30 So I I so people that I work with here I
52:34 I reached out to the bricks astronomy
52:37 team here. So because astronomy we have
52:39 the bricks astronomy for the bricks so
52:41 countries so they have the office. So I
52:43 I reached out to the league and then I
52:45 proposed that
52:48 don't you think we need to organize some
52:49 sort of um learning um event for young
52:54 people who are interested in astronomy
52:56 and he was like okay what do you want? I
52:58 say yes I know uh this there's a lot of
53:01 um summer schools but most times the
53:03 summer schools always center on the
53:06 physics itself. So even when they are
53:08 doing the Python
53:10 they have they usually have the
53:12 especially for developed countries like
53:13 America or Europe they usually have the
53:15 notion that you're already very good at
53:17 programming right so um we started this
53:21 whole thing I made the first proposal
53:23 last year I think around um October or
53:26 so and was like okay this is a good idea
53:27 we're going to discuss it and then um
53:30 around um January they would finalize it
53:33 and say okay a lot of people now came in
53:36 um we have the institute called idea.
53:38 They provide a cloud service for
53:39 astronomy and then the bricks astronomy
53:42 group and then um other people from
53:44 India an institute in India. So we have
53:46 two professors from there who teach um
53:48 computational astronomy physics. So they
53:50 were like oh this is a good idea for
53:52 beginners in astronomy to say so we
53:54 called it data based astronomy data
53:57 analytics program. So it's it was a an
54:00 8x program that is designed for those
54:04 who are like who have no background in
54:06 programming. So it's a pure analytics
54:08 studio come in you learn the process you
54:10 learn the coding process from Python
54:12 just beginner level Python and then at
54:14 the end of the day so we also
54:16 incorporated like assignment so like I
54:17 said I borrowed your template so doing
54:20 this like making sure every week there's
54:22 always a lecture and then there's also
54:23 like a presentation hands-on that people
54:25 need to do and then um at the end of the
54:28 course there was a project so in the at
54:33 the beginning of the whole thing we also
54:34 mentioned that people should share their
54:36 resources online So I to be honest my
54:38 LinkedIn that's why I say I don't know
54:40 how you do this my LinkedIn has been
54:43 because we had more than 900 people sign
54:46 up for this program
54:48 shift and then um in the course of this
54:50 whole thing the video is also there on
54:51 YouTube
54:52 uh because I was the lead facilitator so
54:54 you're training people they are learning
54:56 they come in we also have to do it two
54:58 two times so morning and evening to just
55:00 make sure we accommodate people either
55:01 in the eastern part of the world or the
55:03 western part of the world so um it was
55:06 very very successful and they did a
55:08 project
55:10 like you know what you're just a
55:12 beginner yes maybe I encourage the
55:15 second one even if you just do it in a
55:16 Jupyter notebook for now in a collab
55:19 that is sharable I emphasize that they
55:21 should make sure that they put the whole
55:22 things in collab because with collab you
55:24 can share the link people can see
55:25 exactly what do you even see the result
55:27 so they did that and they were able to
55:29 also tell the story taking um astronomy
55:33 data for those who have astronomy
55:34 background or if you have so because
55:36 there were a lot of people who were not
55:37 like you know amateur astronomers who
55:40 wanted who signed up for the program
55:42 because they just wanted to use the
55:43 opportunity to see how what is happening
55:45 there. So we had more than 190
55:49 submissions of project that we had done
55:51 and a whole lot of them got their
55:52 certificates at the same time. um you
55:55 know they shared their learning uh
55:57 things on on
55:59 um this program finished in July first
56:03 around first second week of July and uh
56:06 about two three people have reached out
56:08 to say oh they are so happy about this
56:11 that um it has helped them to even
56:13 improve their uh what's it called again
56:16 especially those applying for
56:17 postgraduate opportunities so you want
56:21 to also show a form of projects
56:23 that you've done also to demonstrate
56:24 that you know how to code, you know how
56:26 to think about solving problems, taking
56:29 a data, doing analysis and generating
56:31 results. So some of them did very things
56:33 that were like I was surprised like how
56:35 did you guys do come up with these whole
56:37 ideas. So the thing is
56:40 irrespective of where you are um if
56:42 you're just starting make sure you learn
56:44 the basics but while you are learning
56:46 the basics think about the problems that
56:48 basics can solve right um if your
56:51 background let's say your background is
56:52 finance or your background is economics
56:55 and you just learn how to maybe use
56:57 pandas to read a data and you learn how
57:00 to do basic statistical analysis the
57:02 next thing should be to find an
57:04 economics data right you already have
57:06 some basics economic background use py
57:08 to do the same thing and share the
57:10 results. Explain what you have done. It
57:12 helps a lot. At least people are saying
57:14 that you have both the technical knowhow
57:17 in your background. You also have the
57:18 technical knowhow um I would just say
57:21 scientific knowhow or knowledge in of
57:23 your field and you also have the
57:24 technical knowhow in terms of how to use
57:26 uh tools to derive um results. So
57:30 irrespective of where you are just make
57:32 sure you're doing that. I'm not
57:34 discouraging Jupyter notebook when you
57:35 start you can also use Jupyter notebook
57:37 share make sure the link is shared so
57:39 that people and put it on collab because
57:41 with collab people can easily go open it
57:43 up and they will see what you're doing
57:46 they just explain the steps that you've
57:48 taken
57:48 and all that. Yeah.
57:50 Yeah. So basically how to what works in
57:53 the field and your answer if I may
57:56 summarize it is first face focus on
57:59 basic basics for machine learning this
58:02 uh would be python programming and then
58:05 do projects and for projects what helps
58:08 is having some sort of structure so for
58:10 example this is what we did in our
58:11 courses so say okay this is what is
58:14 expected this is the criteria we use for
58:16 revelating so now for you it's simpler
58:18 to go ahead and implement the project
58:20 and this is what you borrowed and this
58:22 is what you used in your course and you
58:25 were saying that it works. Students were
58:27 happy and some of them found new
58:30 interesting opportunities, right?
58:31 Oh yes, of course. So um because you
58:33 know this is a system where students are
58:35 applying for like um um PhD
58:37 opportunities, masters are coming out.
58:39 So people are always applying and then
58:41 you also want to like you know show
58:43 strong motivation that you have
58:44 programming skills or this in the area
58:46 that you're interested in. you've done
58:48 something already like maybe taking data
58:51 somewhere and doing physical analysis
58:52 that shows that you already have a
58:54 background and um it's um you know they
58:56 say seeing is believing yeah so
58:59 communicating astronomy is beautiful I
59:01 can say I know this but when you now say
59:03 okay I was able to get this data
59:04 somewhere and I was able to do this um
59:06 you know because I was taking the data
59:08 analysis project becomes like a plus for
59:10 you as a student
59:13 and then uh the same question actually
59:15 has two questions the question this the
59:18 other part is should I focus on data
59:19 engineering or data science/machine
59:21 learning what do you think
59:23 uh well uh I'll just say start with data
59:26 science first data engineering is um
59:28 it's um it's a bit technical so because
59:31 you need to understand data itself
59:33 initially before going to
59:35 because data engineering is more like
59:37 managing data provisioning data
59:39 warehousing so understand what data is
59:42 first
59:43 yeah but also it depends where you start
59:46 um so if you start as a software
59:47 engineer then maybe for you data
59:49 engineering will be easier than machine
59:51 learning.
59:52 Well, that's true. Yeah, I'm just
59:54 answering from maybe I don't know the
59:56 like you to yourself four years ago,
59:59 right?
1:00:00 Yeah.
1:00:01 Okay. Yeah. Uh there's also a question
1:00:04 about my t-shirt actually install DT
1:00:07 that.
1:00:08 Yeah, it's a DT. Yeah,
1:00:12 it's a data load tool. DT is one of our
1:00:15 sponsors. uh they support data dos club
1:00:18 and with them we did quite a few things
1:00:21 already so you can go and check our
1:00:24 YouTube channel for um so they are a
1:00:27 data engineering tool let's say you have
1:00:30 some things that are let's say on S3 and
1:00:34 you want to move them to um bequery you
1:00:38 can easily use uh data load tool for
1:00:41 that also doing some transformation and
1:00:43 so it's a very convenient way to build
1:00:45 pipelines. So, and because they sponsor
1:00:49 um our community, they also Berlin
1:00:52 based, so they gave me this t-shirt and
1:00:54 I like this t-shirt. It's just a
1:00:56 coincidence that I wore it for today's
1:00:57 stream. I sometimes do that. Um but
1:01:00 yeah, it's a very convenient t-shirt. I
1:01:03 like it. But yeah, give them a go. And u
1:01:07 with that, uh we should be actually
1:01:09 wrapping up. Maybe Daniel, last question
1:01:11 to you. If anyone wants if anyone wants
1:01:15 to learn more about um astronomy and
1:01:20 data science in astronomy. Um you
1:01:23 mentioned Astropi. Is there any resource
1:01:27 for learning Astropy?
1:01:29 Oh yes, there's um there's um just
1:01:31 Google Astrop Astropy Len. Um
1:01:35 Astropy what?
1:01:36 Len
1:01:38 astropy len. Yeah. So,
1:01:41 there's a couple of tutorials on on it.
1:01:45 You will see how to get
1:01:46 I cannot quickly find it. Maybe
1:01:51 Yeah. Astropy.
1:01:52 Yeah. So, um let me len.org.
1:01:56 I'm sending it now.
1:01:57 Learn. Okay.
1:02:02 Yes.
1:02:03 Okay. Please send it because like
1:02:05 doesn't load for me.
1:02:07 Okay. Sent it in the chat. It's
1:02:09 that.org. Sorry, I wrote home
1:02:13 or
1:02:15 let me Yeah,
1:02:17 I'm going to share it in live chat.
1:02:22 Okay.
1:02:26 Okay, I share it. Okay, Daniel, thanks a
1:02:29 lot for joining us today, for sharing
1:02:31 your story. Um, I'm pretty sure it
1:02:33 motivated and will motivate a lot of
1:02:35 people cuz I also want to use your story
1:02:37 as an example why they should uh share
1:02:40 what they learn in public. So, thanks a
1:02:42 lot for uh joining us today and for
1:02:46 talking about astronomy, machine
1:02:48 learning and how um you liked our
1:02:51 courses. Thanks a lot.
1:02:52 Yeah, sure. Thank you too, Alex, for um
1:02:55 like I say pulling all that courses for
1:02:57 free is not easy. And I hope um are you
1:02:59 able to get sponsors for the next MLOps
1:03:01 camp because I was worried when you said
1:03:04 oh it's going to be the last if you
1:03:06 don't get any sponsor because I think
1:03:07 that course is very very essential
1:03:08 especially for anybody that wants to do
1:03:10 AI LLM related stuff because if you
1:03:13 don't understand the whole concept
1:03:14 around MLOps
1:03:16 ah you're going to struggle with
1:03:18 the MLOps um it's sad that I cannot find
1:03:22 any sponsors because all the companies
1:03:25 that were doing MLOps uh They're now
1:03:28 focusing on more more on AI products
1:03:30 because this is their the high pace
1:03:32 right now. This is where the investor
1:03:34 money is. So many companies are focusing
1:03:38 on this side
1:03:39 which means that for MLOps they don't
1:03:41 have any marketing budget and yeah
1:03:44 I I do understand
1:03:47 the LLM ops 2 is there for people to
1:03:50 to catch up to. Yeah
1:03:52 but let's see maybe things will change.
1:03:54 I will continue reaching out to sponsors
1:03:56 even though I said it probably would be
1:03:58 the last one but if some of them says
1:04:00 okay now we actually want to support the
1:04:04 course we'll just run it again and
1:04:06 probably update a few things so let's
1:04:08 see what happens
1:04:09 and final word is for those listening
1:04:10 please the resources is freely available
1:04:12 on YouTube even if you don't have the
1:04:14 next one just go there because I usually
1:04:16 go there and consulting time intervals
1:04:18 just go there you should bookmark it I
1:04:21 don't know if it's what it's called in
1:04:22 YouTube make sure you save them
1:04:24 something that you can always go to GR
1:04:25 because the resources are freely
1:04:26 available and the tools are not
1:04:29 necessarily changing because they are
1:04:30 still there um they are not outdated.
1:04:33 Yeah.
1:04:33 Yeah. We are not going to remove any
1:04:35 content. So the envelopes course is
1:04:37 going to stay on GitHub regardless of
1:04:39 whether we will find sponsors or not.
1:04:41 All the content will stay there. So you
1:04:43 can just watch uh the videos when you
1:04:46 want.
1:04:48 Okay, that's it. Thanks everyone for
1:04:51 joining us today and thanks Danielle.
