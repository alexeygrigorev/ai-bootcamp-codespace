1:41 between
1:42 the two and we have a special guest
1:44 today leo leor has experience of over 12
1:47 years
1:47 in building data teams leveraging data
1:50 for growth
1:51 and he learned a lot from that he
1:53 experienced a lot of pains
1:55 and he even has written a book about
1:57 this
1:58 and he also hosts a podcast the podcast
2:02 has a name what the data
2:04 and i full disclosure i was a guest on
2:08 this podcast once so go and check it out
2:10 so welcome to our event
2:15 i am so happy to be here actually i
2:17 think that
2:18 one of my my happiest moment is when i'm
2:21 talking to data scientists
2:23 and data engineers and i was like yes we
2:25 can do some
2:26 so many cool things together so i'm
2:29 happy to be here
2:30 yes welcome so before we go into our
2:34 main topic
2:35 of communicating with business let's
2:37 talk a bit about your background because
2:39 well i know with 12 years of experience
2:42 you probably
2:43 saw a lot of things so can you tell us a
2:45 bit about your career journey so far
2:49 so i'm a dinosaur as as we call it i
2:52 started my
2:52 data career even before there was uh
2:56 any google analytics or any id of google
2:58 analytics on board we used very simple
3:01 uh and now analytics tools that were
3:04 installed locally by us uh
3:08 and then in the last couple of years i
3:11 was working for zalando
3:14 and they're basically done the entire
3:15 transformation of the data
3:17 for the marketing department was working
3:20 for la vu
3:20 a dating app to the ones who don't know
3:22 it a quite cool
3:24 company and they're also kind of a
3:28 project manager product manager to help
3:30 constructing data and now
3:34 lately i am running the podcast water
3:36 data where i'm interviewing quite a lot
3:37 of
3:38 data and business people and trying to
3:39 actually bridge the communication
3:41 between these two functions to actually
3:43 drive or leverage the data for growth
3:47 and then also i'm managing director of
3:48 terabit data which basically
3:51 is a company that we started as an
3:53 agency now we're moving more towards a
3:55 product
3:56 approach that helping companies to set
3:59 up their data infrastructure in a quick
4:00 way so they can
4:02 focus on hiring good data engineers and
4:04 not being under pressure
4:05 to run around yes
4:08 thanks so your profile i checked your
4:10 linkedin profile
4:12 and it says that your position your
4:13 title now is a data strategist
4:16 and which makes me wonder what does a
4:19 data strategist do
4:21 so as i said data strategist is the
4:23 person who sits between the data
4:25 engineering the data science
4:27 and the business and trying to find the
4:30 right approach
4:32 to use the data so one of the biggest
4:36 pains that i suffered as a product
4:37 manager for data for very long time
4:40 was that i need a dashboard i need it
4:41 now i need it tomorrow ah the
4:43 calculation is wrong i don't trust it
4:45 it's supposed to be eight why is it four
4:47 and
4:48 what a data strategist as i see it needs
4:50 to do it needs to balance between the
4:52 two
4:53 uh functions of the tech and the
4:55 business and ensure that both of them
4:57 actually speak in the right language
4:58 and on the second on the second part
5:00 they also have the right strategy so
5:02 they're actually understanding
5:03 when we're talking about installs what
5:05 do we mean when we're saying install
5:07 what do we mean when we're talking about
5:08 session
5:09 and when we're running a model for
5:11 forecasting for example revenues
5:14 how is it being calculated so the
5:15 business not going to go into the
5:17 details of is it a
5:18 random forest or a linear calculation or
5:21 they will ask but they're not really
5:23 understanding what's stand behind it
5:24 what they care about is how accurate it
5:26 is
5:27 and this is where you need to come in
5:29 and actually
5:30 make sure that the understanding level
5:32 is correct between everybody
5:34 and there is also a trust to the data
5:37 because because
5:38 i think a lot of business people don't
5:40 trust the data and this is something i
5:42 always
5:43 i always suffered from so i know it
5:45 cannot be the data is correct
5:46 check it again i'm missing something
5:48 here and and this is this is where that
5:50 strategy
5:50 actually should come in and support
5:52 organization in its any better how to
5:54 use it
5:55 so as understood you have
5:59 you do two things so one you're the
6:02 bridge between uh
6:03 the technical people and the business
6:05 people right so you help communicate
6:08 so you have translate
6:11 translate i don't know the requirements
6:13 maybe and develop
6:15 trust for business so business people
6:16 don't trust in data
6:19 and you help them to to have this trust
6:21 so you have you you
6:23 help you help them understand what's
6:25 going on behind the hood
6:27 and then at the same time you also
6:28 probably do that the other way around
6:30 you help
6:31 the technical people to understand what
6:34 business wants from them right
6:36 yeah so i like to say that i'm the idiot
6:38 in the room
6:39 that asking all the idiotic questions
6:41 that everybody else are afraid to ask
6:43 that's how i see it myself at the end if
6:45 i need to sum it up
6:48 and you also you as i understood you
6:51 you are coming from the product
6:52 management background right so you are
6:54 more from the business side coming into
6:57 tech rather than from tech to the
6:58 business side right
6:59 so i actually i started my way in the
7:01 tech i was uh
7:03 in the path of being a developer then i
7:06 decided that
7:08 life too short for me to sit down and
7:11 debug code
7:12 i think this was one of my biggest
7:14 frustration always
7:17 and then i moved more towards the
7:18 product but i'm still
7:20 coding so i'm still writing python i'm
7:22 still also i know sql is not a code but
7:24 i'm still writing sql queries
7:26 i'm still running r queries sometimes
7:29 using r for different parts
7:32 so i'm still connected to the code but
7:33 i'm trying not to develop because i know
7:35 i'm
7:36 embedding it but i also understand
7:38 enough code to be able to actually
7:40 translate it into something that people
7:41 can understand
7:42 or i can at least look at it and see
7:44 what's going on in there
7:46 so you basically have background of a
7:49 technical person you also
7:51 have a background of a product manager
7:54 which puts you in this unique position
7:56 of being able to understand both
7:59 speak the same language to like not the
8:02 same language but uh
8:05 be able to translate from one world to
8:07 another from one
8:08 function to another and uh
8:12 from your point of view how can we
8:13 improve communication between
8:16 within the technical side and the
8:17 business side what are the things we can
8:19 do
8:19 to to make it better smoother
8:22 so you know one one of the the most
8:25 idiotic things that
8:27 i noticed that improving communication
8:30 is when something goes wrong with the
8:32 data or with the
8:33 formula a small email that being sent
8:37 out and saying guys
8:39 don't use it we're checking what went
8:40 wrong and only even if it was triggered
8:43 automatically so to try to trigger it
8:44 automatically before people even
8:46 starting using the data
8:48 uh in today's world we're trying to
8:50 finish processes before people arrive to
8:51 the office also we don't have any office
8:53 any
8:54 anymore we're all sitting at home but
8:56 we're trying to make it
8:58 available for people from let's say from
8:59 around 8 a.m 9 00
9:01 a.m 10 a.m whatever you're setting it up
9:03 and people are expecting to have the
9:05 data at this point
9:06 and one of the key components here and
9:08 especially when we're talking about
9:10 creating trust is to trigger this
9:13 small email that's saying everything was
9:15 working fine you can use the data
9:17 or there was an issue don't use the data
9:19 because it may cause you to make the
9:21 wrong
9:22 decisions and once somebody starting to
9:24 suspect your data you lost this trust
9:26 and to buy it again
9:28 will take you a long long time longer
9:30 than what you even expect
9:32 it's just creating more frustration it's
9:34 just causing
9:35 more backlogs on on you as a as a
9:38 developer
9:40 and in the in the long run you got just
9:42 gonna find yourself
9:44 running into an issue of they don't
9:46 trust me
9:47 i still do my job i'm traded sorry i'm
9:50 i'm frustrated for my job and basically
9:53 it
9:54 you also the data scientist and all the
9:56 data data engineer becoming very
9:58 frustrated this is something i noticed
9:59 and
10:00 i wasn't aware of it because for me at
10:02 the beginning when i started was like
10:03 okay there is a request
10:05 you need to make it happen i don't care
10:07 how it happens it needs to happen
10:09 but very quickly i realized that a lot
10:12 of these requests are coming actually
10:14 from frustration from the business
10:15 person
10:16 who is transferring it now to the
10:18 technical guy who
10:21 could have solved it just by sending an
10:22 email saying listen dude
10:24 i checked the data everything is looking
10:25 good if you have complaints we can check
10:28 it but there is no reason for you
10:29 because i did the qa for you
10:31 i checked that the data is correct and
10:34 is
10:34 to the best of my knowledge if you
10:36 spotted something
10:37 i would be more than happy to do to have
10:39 a conversation about it
10:40 and it's going to reduce 60 of the of
10:42 the wasting of the time
10:44 back and forth between the tech and the
10:46 business in many cases
10:48 so the main uh the main thing here is
10:51 building trust so business people need
10:54 to have trust
10:55 in the work of data engineer data
10:57 analysts data scientists
10:59 and one of the ways of doing this is
11:03 be upfront be transparent if something
11:05 happens
11:06 just inform immediately right hey
11:08 exactly our job failed
11:10 so today expect some inconsistency in
11:12 the in the data we're working on fixing
11:14 this
11:15 sorry about that right um
11:18 think about think about something else
11:20 so you have a forecast model that you're
11:21 running on a database right
11:23 that's supposed to forecast revenues uh
11:26 let's say that you need to forecast 30
11:27 days ahead or even
11:28 360 days ahead and if you're
11:32 showing a certain number there and the
11:34 people don't trust the number you give
11:36 them
11:37 how can you make them trust it so either
11:40 you're creating some graph that's
11:41 showing them
11:42 what is your confidence level in the
11:44 information
11:46 or either you telling them this is based
11:49 on the most accurate data i have right
11:50 now
11:52 and this is this is what i'm predicting
11:53 because for example
11:55 in many cases when i worked on
11:56 forecasting models
11:58 suddenly a model was crashing it used to
12:00 be very stable on a certain level
12:02 and then one day it crashed and yes
12:05 sometimes marketing have
12:06 changed for example their campaigns or
12:08 stop them and
12:10 the entire model went to to go to the
12:11 garbage because he was counting on a
12:13 certain
12:14 a traffic that's going to happen in some
12:17 other cases it's just that
12:18 the model is not relevant anymore
12:20 because somehow the users that arrive
12:22 completely changed the picture of how he
12:25 is
12:26 observing the operation or some features
12:28 were changing
12:29 and they are not relevant anymore they
12:30 are not available anymore
12:32 and this is the way for the
12:36 the data scientist to create a small
12:39 dashboard even and put it somewhere so
12:40 whenever
12:41 people are suspecting that number is
12:42 wrong they can go there they can curate
12:45 quickly and see immediately if there is
12:46 a problem or not
12:48 and this is really small stuff that
12:51 will take us half an hour one hour two
12:54 hours to do
12:56 and it can increase the trust of people
12:58 in terms like
12:59 hugely just because they have access now
13:02 to the data to the back end and they
13:03 know how the calculation going
13:05 and they will be able to themselves
13:06 already see if something went wrong or
13:08 not
13:09 your job is to build a model but also to
13:11 create in certain way
13:15 okay so one so you mentioned that to
13:18 build good communication we need to
13:20 to build trust and then uh
13:24 building trust is informing being
13:26 transparent and the second thing
13:27 is uh just showing
13:31 let's say that even this small things
13:34 like confidence intervals and our
13:35 predictions
13:36 right these things so uh being up front
13:40 that
13:40 our model might be wrong and these are
13:42 potential
13:43 you know boundaries and all that um so
13:48 is there something else that we should
13:49 do
13:50 to uh because i think for good
13:52 communication there should be somebody
13:54 who can speak
13:55 uh the language so in addition to tools
13:57 in addition to
13:58 all this alerting we need to have
14:01 somebody who
14:02 who can do this uh you can call it the
14:04 data strategist or
14:06 um i think usually it can be like maybe
14:09 at the
14:10 product manager who maybe was previously
14:13 somebody technical or maybe a data
14:15 scientist who is going
14:16 more the product side but somebody needs
14:18 to play this translator all right
14:20 not necessarily not necessarily
14:22 necessarily no you can have this
14:24 translator in the middle
14:26 but you as a as a somebody who's
14:29 touching the data
14:30 and basically most of us
14:33 or most of the data engineer data
14:36 scientists looking at themselves as a
14:38 enabler's functions i'm just enabling
14:40 somebody to do his job so he can do
14:42 something better
14:43 the reality is that without you
14:45 understanding
14:46 what the product manager or what the
14:50 marketing or what the finance team or or
14:52 any other team out there
14:54 wants to achieve you won't be able to do
14:57 your job
14:58 as good as you want it to be and i think
15:00 that
15:02 one of the things that i noticed many
15:03 times is that the communication
15:06 is always going either above somebody's
15:09 head or is going
15:10 around it and we're trying to avoid
15:12 because i'm talking tech
15:13 and i will explain the tech side and
15:15 he's talking business he's going to
15:17 explain the business side
15:18 but this is not true and one of the
15:20 things that i actually created
15:22 in many cases when i was working with
15:25 data people
15:26 is i put the data people the data
15:28 engineers the analysts or the
15:30 even the data scientists to sit with the
15:33 business for a day or two
15:34 so they can see what they are doing and
15:38 if you're looking transparency in in how
15:41 you're writing the code and how you're
15:42 creating it
15:43 notifying people it's a great thing that
15:46 save a lot of time for everybody and
15:48 increase the trust qa in the data is a
15:50 great thing instead
15:52 also creating an advantage but also
15:54 sitting with the people that gonna use
15:56 your data at the end
15:57 and understand their problems and what
15:59 they do
16:00 gonna help you to actually communicate
16:02 with them better because then you can
16:03 tell them i listen i was sitting with
16:04 you
16:05 i saw that you're doing x y and z and
16:07 this is why i change actually my process
16:09 to adapt it better to what you do or
16:11 maybe this is something wrong let's try
16:13 to do a different approach
16:15 and it doesn't always to go through a
16:18 third party you're gonna we're gonna
16:19 manage everybody
16:20 there is a one function as i see it
16:24 that is a grow function that is built
16:27 with
16:27 the tech side and the business side and
16:29 both of them should enrich each other
16:31 and give them basically the ability to
16:34 grow and
16:35 learn new stuff the business can come
16:37 with new ideas of automation
16:39 or how to improve the models the data
16:41 side
16:42 should come to the business and tell
16:43 them listen i see that you're doing this
16:45 in these
16:46 operations usually why don't we change
16:48 it why don't we do it better so for
16:50 example
16:51 the most stupid thing that i i i saw was
16:55 uh somebody was
16:58 having five to six clicks to to change
17:00 his bidding
17:01 on on a certain platform and the data
17:04 engineer who was sitting with them was
17:06 like
17:06 hold on but why do you do this i can i
17:08 there is an api i can write it for you
17:10 i can throw you a front end it's going
17:12 to take me maybe a week to build
17:13 something for you an mvp
17:15 and you don't need to do all of these
17:17 clicks around and you just can
17:19 optimize it from one place and it came
17:21 only from the fact that they were
17:22 sitting one next to each other
17:24 and communicated on a level that i
17:27 showed you what i'm doing
17:29 and i will show you what i can do for
17:31 you afterwards
17:33 yeah which which i can totally relate as
17:36 a data scientist i remember
17:38 that once i worked in a team that was
17:41 creating tools for moderators so
17:43 moderators are people who look at uh
17:46 in our in my case uh i work at helix so
17:49 this is a company where you can sell
17:51 things
17:52 and there are people who actually look
17:53 at the content that users produce
17:56 at the listings that people produce
17:59 and they see okay this is something that
18:02 shouldn't go live on the platform
18:03 and they reject they they remove it from
18:05 the platform
18:06 and we were building things for for
18:09 these moderators and remember for me the
18:11 most
18:12 enlightening uh experience was actually
18:15 talking to the moderators sitting or
18:18 watching them how they work
18:19 uh working with them together and
18:21 actually using the system
18:22 uh together with them to to moderate
18:24 content
18:25 so just sitting with the users with the
18:28 the with those people who are going to
18:31 consume the data products consume the
18:33 machine learning services
18:34 i think this is uh i can totally agree
18:37 that it's it brings the understanding on
18:39 the next level
18:40 and also this experience that you see
18:43 the first hand
18:44 what kind of problems they have uh
18:47 like it gives you a different
18:49 perspective right
18:50 yeah and to remember data
18:54 is not an enabling function it's a
18:56 leading function at the end of the day
18:58 without having the right data having the
19:01 right
19:02 outcome of the data nobody will be able
19:05 to do anything
19:06 it's not only enabling it's also growing
19:08 it's also part of the growth
19:10 of the organization and and making the
19:12 organization much stronger even if
19:13 you're working so for example for me
19:15 i was working as a as a freelancer for a
19:18 while for cisco
19:19 in the recruitment team and one of the
19:22 most
19:22 important parts for the recruitment team
19:24 was actually
19:26 the recruitment process and to analyze
19:29 it and to understand
19:30 which positions actually were issues or
19:32 not or which position can be improved
19:35 with the candidate so maybe we are
19:36 missing something that we don't see
19:37 today
19:38 and you can only drive this stuff
19:42 when you're sitting with the recruiter
19:44 together and you're understanding how
19:45 he's working
19:47 and the same thing goes to the marketing
19:48 and the same thing goes to every place
19:50 and a lot of these recruiters are also
19:52 frustrated many times from their job
19:54 because
19:55 there is a hiring manager that's stuck
19:57 in the process
19:59 and maybe you can actually create some
20:02 panel of some dashboard for them that
20:03 they can go and say okay
20:05 you are stuck in my process let's see
20:07 how we can move faster
20:08 how we can improve the process and
20:10 actually bring better candidates or if
20:11 candidates feeling that they are
20:13 suffering
20:14 how can you actually improve it and i
20:16 think that this is one of the points
20:18 that
20:19 only by sitting together and combining
20:20 forces you can actually try this
20:22 this growth and
20:25 then i was just thinking about the
20:29 example you gave like when somebody was
20:31 taking six clicks and the data engineer
20:33 approached and said
20:34 hey we can make it easier for you
20:38 but i imagine then there are some cases
20:40 when the data engineer would have a
20:42 pushback
20:43 like maybe in cases when there is not
20:45 enough trust between
20:46 between the technical part and the
20:48 business part yet
20:50 uh when they think okay this is some
20:53 uh i don't know somebody coming from
20:56 outside
20:57 who's telling us how to do things
21:00 uh like no we will keep doing things the
21:03 old way
21:04 so how how to deal with these sort of
21:06 pushbacks like
21:07 uh when you say hey i want to help you
21:10 do your job better
21:11 but yeah so not everyone
21:16 gets immediately excited about this idea
21:20 go to the juniors no i'm joking
21:25 one one of the key things that i i was
21:28 encouraging people is actually to go
21:30 into either to do it on the hackathons
21:32 then
21:34 and use a hackathon as an opportunity to
21:35 actually present it to a
21:37 larger crowd the other part is that if
21:41 you think that this is something that
21:42 really not going to take you that
21:44 long work on it as a side hustle uh
21:48 when you have some free time and then
21:50 present it and tell him like
21:51 you can keep doing your own stuff there
21:53 but let's try
21:55 let's let's give this one a try for a
21:56 week or week and half and see what
21:58 happens
21:59 if you trust enough that what you
22:00 constructed and what you created is
22:02 actually something that's going to
22:03 serve them to the better and you're
22:07 going to give it to them and then i'm
22:08 like
22:08 let's try for a week what can go wrong
22:10 right nothing can go wrong if you're
22:12 going to try it for a week
22:13 there is no chance that they're going to
22:15 push it back
22:17 and i think yes there is a lot of
22:19 pushbacks for tech people no don't do
22:21 that
22:22 i have a i have a bigger strategy that i
22:24 need you to to work on
22:26 but right now i see that there is a
22:28 problem that i can solve you quite
22:30 quickly so why
22:30 don't you let me work on it for a week
22:33 so we're gonna have a seed back of a
22:34 week and
22:35 a lot of companies that working for
22:36 example with okrs and stuff like this
22:39 okay so you're going to reach out to 0.5
22:41 instead of 0.7 because you
22:43 had an extra week working on something
22:46 else
22:47 but it saved you the amount of time that
22:49 you saved you
22:50 this is what actually counting at the
22:52 end of the day if you're thinking about
22:54 an organization that have 14 people that
22:57 all their job is just to download
22:58 reports from different
23:00 platforms and then do copy paste of them
23:03 into excel sheet
23:05 this doesn't make any sense right it's a
23:07 waste of time it's 14 employees that
23:09 working an entire month
23:10 or half of the month just on downloading
23:12 data no organization gonna come and tell
23:15 you like you know what
23:15 no that's a that's a stupid idea to
23:18 automate it why would we do it
23:19 on the contrary organization wants to
23:21 automate this process so these employees
23:23 can actually do their
23:24 actual job which is not sitting there
23:28 and download reporting but actually
23:29 going over the data make the right
23:31 decision change the bds
23:33 change the right the right approach
23:36 for for the growth so if it's for
23:38 example removing items or adding items
23:40 to the shop
23:41 this is what their job is their job is
23:43 not to download the data and just
23:44 copy paste it into excel and this is
23:47 where we're coming into the picture and
23:48 we should
23:49 push quite hard and find our right way
23:52 to actually
23:53 present stuff but we also need to think
23:55 always in a lean way in an mpvp way
23:58 which this is another point that i will
24:01 add here
24:02 don't get complicated with stuff don't
24:03 go into development now of three months
24:05 or six months for a product
24:07 because in the industry that we're
24:08 working in sometimes
24:10 three or six months means the end cycle
24:13 of of feature of a product maybe by the
24:15 time you're going to finish it it's not
24:16 going to be relevant so you need to
24:17 think about
24:18 what can i achieve in a week or week and
24:20 a half or maximum two weeks
24:23 and i can release it outside and
24:26 showcase
24:26 what it's used to and then on top of it
24:29 start building it so start with a lean
24:31 approach
24:32 and then if it's catching move into an
24:34 agile approach
24:35 and again this is this is what i i
24:37 always hate like using these
24:39 okrs or lean or agile because there is
24:42 no one
24:43 one system that fits everybody but we
24:46 need to think about it
24:47 as a cycle you're starting with a lean
24:49 you move into an agile
24:50 after you have agile for a while you can
24:52 move into okay hours because it's
24:53 already more stable and it's more
24:54 morbid and i look at it like a plant
24:57 when i'm starting sitting for example my
24:59 tomatoes to put in the garden
25:01 i'm starting it from the seed and it's
25:02 slowly growing and i need to move it
25:04 into a new pot
25:05 and then when it's in this pot i need to
25:07 let it grow there and i need to move it
25:09 to another pot
25:10 and only in i'm starting it in february
25:13 and only
25:13 may june i'm going to put it into the
25:15 ground and it's going to
25:17 catch with the roots into the soil
25:19 itself
25:20 but until i'm arriving to this point i
25:22 need to have different approaches to the
25:24 plant right when i'm
25:25 seating it i need to make sure it's dark
25:27 and moist for him
25:28 when it's opening up and the leaves are
25:30 coming out i already need to change my
25:32 approach and start
25:33 growing it in a different way and and
25:36 this is also when i'm talking about
25:38 hummus in my book i'm talking exactly
25:40 about that hummus is so simple it's just
25:43 chickpeas tahina lemon a little bit of
25:46 salt
25:47 and garlic and that's it there is no
25:50 magic behind it
25:51 it's so simple and so fast and this is
25:53 how data should be this is how
25:55 people should actually think about their
25:57 their approach to that it should be
25:59 simple but it's filling you up so much
26:01 that you don't want to eat anything else
26:03 afterwards
26:04 it's that simple yeah i'm not sure if it
26:07 makes any sense for me to ask what's
26:09 your favorite food because i think it's
26:11 clear
26:12 [Laughter]
26:14 i will go with hummus most likely yeah
26:18 yeah i thought so yes we will talk a bit
26:21 about who will send your book later but
26:25 i like the metaphor you had like about
26:28 the
26:29 gardening plant but i'm wondering what
26:33 could be the right how can we
26:36 find the right balance between
26:39 complexity and simplicity like
26:41 because i understand that this
26:43 development mvp
26:44 have this hackathon create something
26:47 quick and dirty that just
26:48 to prove value but then at some point it
26:50 becomes a project that
26:52 needs to be maintained and if i as a
26:55 data scientist hack something together
26:57 then any sane engineer would look at
26:59 this and say uh
27:00 i don't want to touch this code right
27:02 but on the other hand
27:04 maybe this is something that i hacked in
27:06 a week
27:07 that works it's far from ideal
27:10 but it doesn't fail all the time uh
27:13 so how do we find the the balance
27:15 between you know this moving fast
27:17 um and doing things may be simple
27:22 versus something complex like how do we
27:25 make sure that we're
27:26 uh you know not doing too much but doing
27:29 right now
27:30 just enough so if if we're looking at it
27:34 it's really it's it should be very very
27:36 simple at the beginning and yes it's
27:37 going to be
27:38 bad it's not going to be beautiful code
27:40 will never be beautiful
27:42 and this is why i stopped coding as well
27:44 because at some point i realized that my
27:46 code is horrible people didn't want to
27:47 deal with it
27:48 and i don't want i didn't want to have
27:50 this feeling of oh i did a really
27:51 really bad job
27:53 i wanted max i want to make it much
27:55 nicer and
27:57 you start with something ugly you see
27:59 that it works if it works
28:01 then you're creating this approach of
28:03 somebody taking over
28:04 fixing the code building it up creating
28:06 the system of how we're going to grow it
28:08 so what is the end goal of it
28:10 and and how it's going to become a
28:12 better process for us in the future
28:14 and i think that this is basically the
28:16 points that are most relevant for us
28:19 take it the ugly as much as it is check
28:22 that it's
28:22 actually working and you know you know
28:24 what and and i know that a lot of people
28:26 say
28:26 yeah you're talking about about tech and
28:28 needs to work it's going the same thing
28:30 for the business if business wants to
28:31 have a dashboard or they want to have
28:33 some calculation being done
28:34 they need to do it on an excel sheet and
28:36 run with it for several times
28:38 and i am i am my my philosophy is kill
28:41 excel
28:42 there is no use of excel but there are
28:44 certain cases when you want to
28:45 start something and even if the tech
28:48 don't trust it
28:49 you need to start it on an excel sheet
28:51 show that it's actually working you're
28:52 actually using it
28:53 and only then send it up for development
28:56 and it goes
28:57 both sides on the code back disgusting
29:00 code at the beginning
29:01 you're making better or you're starting
29:02 with an excel sheet horrible
29:04 i will kill somebody if i'm gonna see
29:06 him using excel but i have to accept it
29:08 and then it's gonna move into automation
29:10 we need to convince each other and show
29:12 them that actually there is a purpose
29:14 and there is a use for what we do
29:15 and this is the only approach for us
29:18 yeah so as i understood
29:20 having ugly code is fine if we know that
29:23 it's going to be rewritten
29:24 and then even before that even before
29:26 having any code
29:28 try simpler things try excel
29:32 try to see that the idea you have like
29:34 maybe try to solve the problem
29:36 without any code at all at first and see
29:38 if it's valuable
29:40 if it's valid uh i think i heard this
29:42 expression
29:43 uh do things that don't scale first and
29:46 then
29:46 try to automate them right so maybe this
29:49 is uh
29:50 yeah but other thing i am also i'm also
29:53 wondering and this is also it's
29:56 something i experienced in the past
29:59 so you said okay there is some ugly code
30:02 yes
30:03 and then somebody will take this over
30:06 and make it better but how do can we to
30:08 convince somebody to take this over
30:11 uh because i usually have problems with
30:14 uh with that like how do i convince that
30:17 uh
30:18 okay this is my quote i know it's ugly i
30:20 know it's bad
30:21 but it's also a problem how do we
30:24 convince people to actually take this
30:26 over
30:26 and you know make it better
30:30 look at your code and look at it as an
30:33 excel sheet at the end of the day
30:34 it will go to the garbage because we're
30:36 going to automate it you wrote the code
30:38 just to prove a point the pro the point
30:40 was proven
30:41 there is now a use case for it there is
30:43 a business
30:44 uh that's standing behind it that can
30:46 actually push for it
30:48 then start rebuilding it from scratch or
30:50 take the old code and try to improve it
30:52 but
30:53 don't also don't get insulted if
30:55 somebody tells you okay listen i don't
30:56 like your code i want to rebuild it
30:58 it's completely fine he's taking
30:59 ownership and at the end of the day when
31:01 he own it
31:02 it's his responsibility to make sure
31:03 that the court is looking better
31:05 and it's his responsibility to also
31:06 understand and being able to explain to
31:08 others
31:09 what is he doing uh and and this is
31:12 again something that
31:13 i learned quite heavily when i'm running
31:16 now my company so we're using a lot of
31:18 external resources for different parts
31:21 of our code
31:22 we cannot always run all over it and
31:24 ensure that
31:25 we can cover everything and sometimes
31:27 this code is not
31:29 the best but at least he's doing the
31:31 function
31:32 is is creating the id it's creating the
31:34 concept and the demand
31:36 and then from there we're gonna take it
31:37 and we're gonna streamline it we're
31:39 gonna fix it we're gonna
31:40 we're gonna create something that can be
31:42 used in the future
31:44 but we need to start somewhere and then
31:46 from the moment that there is enough
31:47 clear
31:48 use case and an ownership everything can
31:51 run smoothly and i think
31:52 nobody going to come and tell you like
31:54 nah i don't think that
31:56 there is i want to use this tool if
31:58 there is a used case
32:00 this is the reason why you're developing
32:02 code you're not developing code just to
32:03 to say
32:04 yeah i'm sitting here and i'm writing
32:06 python no
32:08 you're sitting here because you want to
32:10 solve a problem that's going to help
32:11 your company to grow
32:13 and this is exactly the reason why
32:14 you're there this exactly the reason why
32:16 you should take this now
32:18 and start working on it and fix it yes
32:20 and
32:21 basically don't get attached to the to
32:23 the code so if i
32:24 wrote my code and somebody says um
32:27 yeah just don't get attached to this
32:29 right so
32:32 if somebody wants to rewrite and it's a
32:34 reasonable
32:35 time frame right so it doesn't take it
32:38 doesn't it's not going to take six
32:39 months
32:40 then it's fine right you know how many
32:43 times people were telling me that
32:45 something i was
32:46 doing looked disgusting so i was for
32:48 example
32:49 in in many many times i used to be the
32:51 first one to build dashboards
32:53 my color picking is horrible okay
32:56 let's let's put it this way uh when i
32:59 was 18 years old i was requested to do
33:01 some presentation for somebody
33:03 and the only reaction that i received
33:05 was the colors you picked
33:07 were the most horrible colors i've ever
33:09 seen in my life and i don't know how
33:11 somebody can survive with such a call or
33:13 a call or pet
33:14 and i didn't care and i told him like it
33:17 doesn't matter did you understand
33:18 the message i tried to transfer to you
33:20 through the presentation
33:21 and he was like yes and i was like great
33:23 so now you can take it you can
33:25 create the right color schema for that
33:27 you can add whatever images you want and
33:30 cut them whatever way you want
33:32 the the most important part is that the
33:34 message and the use case here are
33:36 transferred
33:37 and i think that this this is life this
33:40 is life at the end of the day and
33:42 since then every time i'm building a
33:43 dashboard i know already it's not going
33:45 to be beautiful somebody's going to come
33:46 and make it much more beautiful than
33:47 what i do
33:48 and i accept it i accept it i don't i
33:51 don't fight against it
33:54 yeah that's uh
33:59 i i was again going back to this ugly
34:01 code and when we
34:02 moving fast so it creates uh
34:06 a reaction from engineers okay this is
34:08 called this
34:09 is a bad code we want to rewrite but
34:12 the other thing it might create it might
34:14 cause business to think
34:17 that this speed is the usual speed so
34:19 this is the speed you can
34:21 expect things to happen in the future
34:23 right so
34:24 next time the new thing the new feature
34:27 added to this
34:28 uh raw prototype it will also be added
34:31 in a week it will also be added
34:33 i don't know after a couple of days and
34:36 so i think it creates this
34:37 false sense of you know moving very fast
34:41 so do you have some tips how to handle
34:45 expectations from from business when it
34:47 comes to
34:48 you know mvp versus development
34:52 so one of the one of the things that
34:55 i'm talking about a lot is is
34:58 and almost
35:03 you can do it in the slow way the quick
35:05 way you're just going to go and buy
35:07 chickpeas in a can you're going to wash
35:09 them a little bit ground them at some
35:10 tahina and here you go you have humus
35:12 and it's hummus i'm not gonna fight with
35:16 you it's hummus at the end of the day
35:17 you have chickpeas you have the hina you
35:18 have the mess the basic ingredients
35:20 and it's great but is it actually
35:24 the taste you were after no if you
35:27 really want to get this taste you will
35:29 need to
35:30 soak the chickpeas for 24 hours you will
35:32 need to cook them for
35:33 two to three hours until they're getting
35:35 soft you need to grind them you need to
35:37 cool them down
35:38 you need to mix them with tahini there
35:40 is a large large large process and what
35:42 i'm always explaining is that
35:43 yes this one is my who moves from from
35:46 from a can
35:47 this is just to give you a taste of what
35:50 hummus can be
35:52 now let's move and work on the hummus
35:54 itself
35:55 and if i'm going outside of this
35:56 metaphor of almost the reality is that
35:58 yes
35:59 the beginning is always fast because
36:00 you're doing the minimal things that you
36:02 need to do
36:03 but now every feature that you need to
36:05 develop on top of it
36:06 going to take time it's going to take
36:07 much more thinking because hold on
36:09 now we made sure that it's relevant and
36:11 it's needed and required
36:13 now let's figure out actually how we're
36:15 making it not only
36:16 needed and required but also used and
36:18 loved and this is
36:20 two different stories it's a
36:23 chickpeas from a can a chickpeas you
36:25 cook yourself they will have two
36:27 different tastes it's gonna be this
36:29 completely different and this is exactly
36:30 how i'm looking at development of code
36:33 i know what i will use next time when i
36:35 explain why it's
36:36 taken so long
36:42 yeah great i was also i wanted to ask
36:46 you a bit
36:47 i i really loved the metaphor i even
36:49 forgot what i wanted to talk about
36:51 so i think i wanted to also cover
36:54 talking to people who do not know how to
36:57 code
36:58 right so let's say again
37:01 we're talking to business but they don't
37:03 always
37:04 understand the effort you put so maybe
37:07 they don't care that
37:08 between the difference between you know
37:10 this fast hummus and
37:11 uh uh proper hummus right
37:14 so because they don't see all these
37:17 intricacies they are not into hummus
37:18 they
37:19 they are not into coding so how do you
37:22 talk to people
37:24 uh who don't understand all these
37:27 complexities about
37:28 coding um how
37:31 how to structure the conversation uh
37:35 with them so so if they don't understand
37:38 coding and this is
37:39 a lot of people don't understand coding
37:40 and to be honest i i think i'm very
37:43 lucky that i had a chance to actually
37:45 sit down and understand how to write
37:46 code and how to work with it
37:48 but uh if we're looking at how we're
37:51 creating basically a process
37:54 that is meaningful it's to go and sit
37:57 down
37:58 with the people who don't understand
38:00 code and explain to them
38:01 why you're doing what you do and why is
38:03 it taking time
38:04 and speak to them in their language that
38:06 they're going to understand but on the
38:07 other side also
38:08 show them your code explain to them bro
38:11 bring them into your process
38:12 explain to them there is a certain way
38:15 of how i'm working so there is the
38:16 definition of done
38:18 but this is how my code look like and
38:21 when you sing for example that you
38:22 committed for something that gonna take
38:24 you two weeks
38:25 and you don't think you can make it in
38:27 two weeks come
38:28 early enough to them and tell them like
38:30 listen guys i have this this and this
38:32 right now that disturbing me
38:33 i have this issue that don't allow me to
38:35 keep developing
38:37 and i won't be able to i won't be able
38:39 to deliver it on time
38:40 they gonna understand it and not only
38:42 that you know what i had a
38:44 very very uh non-technical director i
38:47 was working with
38:48 uh and every time he got he saw a code
38:52 he started to have a rush he couldn't
38:53 sit in the room anymore once he saw the
38:55 code
38:55 but when a developer came to a material
38:57 like listen i'm blocked because x and y
39:01 you could have seen him sitting there
39:02 not have not understanding
39:04 one line of code and asking questions in
39:06 a very structured way of okay why
39:08 doesn't it work
39:09 what are the issues where is it blocked
39:11 what can i do to actually help you
39:13 and then go and back then it was it was
39:16 calling to facebook
39:18 to talk to them about an issue that the
39:19 developer had with an api
39:21 and it's just because he had the right
39:23 connection and he knew exactly the right
39:24 people to reach out to
39:25 and and sometimes this can
39:29 create this good communication also
39:31 between the business and the tech
39:33 even if it doesn't understand code
39:35 you're going to understand problems
39:36 you're going to understand brokers you
39:37 understand why
39:38 this is not going to be ready right time
39:40 and this i think what is important to
39:41 actually make sure that we're doing
39:44 yes again uh back to the point we
39:46 discussed at the beginning is
39:48 just sitting together uh trying to build
39:51 trust
39:52 trying to show uh trying to learn from
39:55 each other
39:55 like i as a data scientist and willing
39:57 to learn from
39:59 uh from you i want to see what kind of
40:02 problems you have
40:03 and then if i am a business person
40:06 i am willing to learn what kind of
40:09 problems the data scientist
40:10 has right or data engineer and then if
40:13 we do that
40:14 if we sit together and try to understand
40:17 what's on our mind what's on the mind of
40:20 uh
40:21 you know the opposite sort of not
40:23 opposite but uh
40:24 like for business to understand tech
40:26 protect to understand business
40:28 uh what kind of problems we have then it
40:31 will develop this sort of trust it will
40:32 develop this sort of connection
40:34 it will develop deeper understanding of
40:37 uh problems
40:38 we have right and then
40:42 then we will not need to explain why
40:44 last time it took one hour to prepare
40:46 something but now it takes one
40:47 one month right because we can show them
40:50 these are the processes this is what we
40:52 need to do this is the the kind of code
40:54 we need to write
40:55 and they will believe us because there
40:56 is trust between us right
40:59 break down the silos so for example one
41:01 of the things that i really loved when i
41:03 worked at
41:04 la vu and also when i worked for the
41:06 lando and also when i worked at cisco
41:08 if there were no stylos between the
41:10 different functions so if i'm
41:12 developing something in code or when i
41:15 am need to deliver some dashboard
41:18 i gonna sit down with my consumers
41:20 together
41:21 and we're gonna have conversations
41:23 together we're gonna go for lunch
41:24 together
41:25 and it sounds a little bit stupid but
41:27 it's working
41:28 because suddenly you have a common
41:30 language because you have a common goal
41:32 together to do
41:33 and and when you don't have these silos
41:36 of okay i'm sitting there i'm in the bi
41:38 team and i'm sitting in my corner
41:41 it's you all the time it's happening
41:43 that will never you will never have a
41:44 good communication once you're gonna go
41:46 down from your i'm sitting in my corner
41:50 and i'm going now sitting with the
41:51 marketing for one day
41:53 and i'm joining their chats and i'm
41:55 listening to what they're talking about
41:57 now when we're working from home for
41:58 example
41:59 one of the key components is actually to
42:01 join or ask to join to their chat so you
42:03 can see what they're talking about what
42:04 is concerning them
42:06 and find your connection points to them
42:08 through that
42:10 and when you are working on something
42:12 that is
42:13 managed by them or needs to be delivered
42:15 to them
42:16 try to also share it on their channels
42:20 not only in the bi channels great we
42:22 finish the sprint will release it no
42:23 go to the marketing or go to the finance
42:26 and tell them hey guys i finished it
42:28 i would love to get the feedback before
42:29 i'm announcing it to my team
42:32 think how it's changing suddenly the way
42:33 that they're looking at you because
42:35 you came to them before you even went to
42:37 your team because you want to get their
42:38 feedback
42:39 so you can actually release something
42:42 you develop for them it's showing them
42:44 also that
42:45 you value their feedback and you value
42:47 their communication
42:50 and it's changing the game completely in
42:52 many cases
42:55 yeah yeah yeah now it's a bit more
42:58 difficult to
42:59 to have these lunches uh together like
43:02 uh
43:03 yeah i remember at some point we had
43:04 this uh uh
43:08 donut in slack this is something like an
43:10 app that randomly connects people
43:12 uh and oftentimes what happened was that
43:16 i am connected with somebody from
43:19 marketing
43:20 or advertisement or some other
43:21 department that i usually
43:24 don't interact with right but they still
43:27 they use data science uh
43:29 products in their work and then having
43:31 this conversation with them
43:33 understanding what kind of things they
43:35 worry about
43:37 even if it's remotely connected to my
43:39 work develops this
43:40 i don't know what's the right word
43:42 empathy understanding what they do
43:45 and deep thinking as well right because
43:48 it's sitting somewhere here in your
43:49 brain
43:50 thinking about it and now since
43:53 everything is remote so one thing
43:55 you suggested to do is uh asking to
43:58 take part in their meetings or maybe
44:00 just uh
44:01 i know maybe having uh random zoom calls
44:04 at some point or whatever to
44:06 we use for for meetings just
44:09 have a conversation maybe a coffee chat
44:11 or something
44:12 don't waste too much of your time
44:14 because your time is is important
44:16 and you still need to to work on other
44:18 stuff but yes at least
44:20 sit in their chat room and see and then
44:22 if you see some something that is
44:23 relevant
44:24 you can always ask them to jump on a
44:25 call or jump on a conversation and then
44:28 you have a trigger and you have a
44:29 connection
44:31 so it's not that joining the meetings
44:33 because i don't believe that
44:35 joining for every week or every second
44:37 week meeting
44:38 going to give you an advantage because
44:40 most of the communication runs through
44:42 today through the chat rooms and then
44:44 when you arrive into the meeting it's
44:46 either already solved or it's already in
44:47 the process to get solved
44:49 it's already too late or it's not
44:50 relevant you're just going to sit there
44:52 and you're going to be bored and you're
44:52 going to start
44:53 coding or you're going to do other stuff
44:55 and you're not going to be focused and
44:56 this is not what we want to
44:58 create we want to create a communication
45:00 that is triggered based on
45:03 important parts so something that
45:04 happened is relevant right now
45:06 yeah clear more clear now so basically
45:09 it could be
45:10 if we use like it could be a slack
45:11 channel right that
45:13 yeah and then just looking what kind of
45:15 problems they talk about
45:16 if something is broken then just pay
45:18 attention to these kind of things
45:20 exactly clear then
45:23 moving on to your favorite topic which
45:26 is uh
45:27 you know what almost
45:30 yes so one of the questions
45:35 uh we have is why data specialists
45:39 don't like hummus but business people do
45:41 and i think you asked me to ask
45:44 you this question because i don't know
45:47 but i'm really curious too a little
45:50 curious to know
45:51 what you what do you have in mind so
45:54 yeah why data specialists don't like
45:55 hummus but business people do
45:58 can you guess
46:00 [Music]
46:03 no because i i am as a data specialist i
46:06 do like hummus do you so
46:10 my my the reason for the expression is
46:13 that business people most of the time
46:15 looking at the very
46:16 end product and the very simple one
46:20 and they don't care about all the nodes
46:23 that goes around
46:24 it and this is why they like hummus and
46:26 data engineers don't like humans because
46:28 they want to see all the details around
46:29 it and they want to
46:30 to understand how the rooms was created
46:32 as well otherwise they're not going to
46:34 trust it
46:35 and this is where we're going on the
46:36 code right you want to know how your
46:38 hummus was created you need to see the
46:39 code that's happening behind me and
46:42 this is why i said it but the reality is
46:44 that
46:45 we need to create this there is love for
46:47 humans for both sides
46:49 just that each of us looking at it in a
46:50 different way me as a business person
46:53 going to look at it only on the top of
46:54 like okay the rooms looks really good
46:56 there is chickpeas there there is a lot
46:58 of olive oil like i like
47:00 and there is some sumac that i really
47:01 enjoying
47:03 and the engineer will look at it in a
47:05 different way is going to start okay so
47:06 what is the hummus made of
47:08 and how can i make it better and this is
47:10 the biggest difference
47:12 when we're talking to each other as well
47:14 when we're communicating
47:15 the view of the of the data engineer or
47:19 the data scientist
47:20 is very deep into the understanding of
47:23 what
47:24 stands behind it the businessman at the
47:26 end of the day his goal is to understand
47:27 that
47:28 what he sees in front of him fitting to
47:30 what he needs
47:31 and he can start using it he can eat it
47:33 he can start consuming it
47:34 and we need to it's really important for
47:36 all of us to actually remember this
47:38 in every process that we're doing that
47:41 yes there is
47:42 looking backwards on the code and
47:44 understand how it works
47:45 but there is also people that looking at
47:47 the end only
47:49 on your end product they don't see what
47:50 happened behind it and they will never
47:52 maybe even understand the process
47:54 why do you suck it for 24 hours or not
47:57 for 12. but they don't have also the
48:00 experience and this is what we need to
48:01 explain to them i did it for 24 hours
48:03 because
48:04 i was switching water in between them so
48:06 i had 12 hours in
48:07 with water that had baking powder inside
48:10 it
48:10 and then i washed it and i put it for
48:12 another 12 hours with the baking
48:14 without the baking powder and this is
48:17 what causing actually the chickpeas to
48:19 be
48:19 software when i'm cooking them and
48:22 we need to really really focus on
48:26 both views and use
48:29 hummus as the main
48:32 way that we're looking at stuff think
48:34 always about the hummus when you're
48:35 dealing with data
48:36 simple as that okay yeah so let's say if
48:40 our company is a kitchen
48:42 then the data engineer is the chief
48:44 right this is the person who prepares
48:46 who cooks the comments right exactly
48:49 then who are the business people are
48:51 they the the visitors right so they
48:54 are the consumers consumed yes so the
48:57 data engineer produces
48:58 a product almost and then the business
49:01 people
49:02 they are actually visitors they go and
49:05 eat hummus and they say oh this is uh
49:08 delicious
49:08 humorous right oh it's a shitty one and
49:11 then you should be ready for that you
49:13 know reviews on google don't lie
49:16 and i always say that in israel in many
49:19 many places where you go to eat homes
49:21 you're gonna go into a place that looks
49:24 really really shitty you're gonna see
49:27 dog peas
49:28 on the floor around the place it's not
49:30 going to look the most attractive one
49:32 but when you're going to go inside
49:33 you're going to eat the best foods for
49:35 your life
49:35 and it's because they have the same
49:37 recipe for the last 50 or 60 years that
49:39 they were working on and they created an
49:41 experience they understood
49:43 how each ingredient that they included
49:46 is
49:46 changing their end issue and me as a
49:49 consumer what i'm after
49:50 is an experience that i'm going to
49:51 remember and when i'm using data
49:54 i need to remember this experience it's
49:56 not just that i'm using data
49:57 don't just create dashboards don't just
49:59 create more kpis don't just create
50:01 another
50:01 forecasting think about what
50:05 you the client will want to eat and be
50:08 very very precise in the way working for
50:10 you
50:12 yes which reminds me of my future of
50:14 sorry
50:15 x manager from former manager from my
50:18 previous company
50:19 he's in israeli and he suggested me
50:22 uh the best place to try hummus in
50:24 berlin so i went to that place
50:27 and it looked super shady like i wasn't
50:29 sure i want to be there in that place
50:33 let me guess azam
50:36 yeah i don't remember it's somewhere in
50:38 um
50:40 in british slaughter burke so near
50:41 chicago
50:43 yeah okay but that was a strange place
50:47 so but hummus was delicious
50:50 so if there are people in berlin that
50:52 wants to go to really really good place
50:53 they should try either
50:55 ako if they want to have like a good
50:59 experience
51:00 or azam which for me is like the top of
51:02 the woman's
51:03 and there is another nice place in the
51:06 middle which is called the eatery
51:09 it's iranian guy strangely enough is
51:12 making really really good hummus
51:14 and he he created the right experience
51:17 for people
51:18 we should add this to the show notes i
51:20 don't know how many people listen
51:22 uh for it from berlin i see one
51:25 uh ankush uh so he commented in uh chat
51:29 i know that he's from berlin
51:31 so yeah if you're into humus ankush you
51:33 know now where to go and
51:36 yeah so why did you call your book uh
51:40 data is like a plate of hummus i think
51:42 i'm getting some ideas from our
51:44 conversation
51:45 uh so this is a great metaphor but maybe
51:48 there's uh
51:49 maybe you have like a short answer to
51:51 that question like why did you call it
51:52 this way
51:53 the the idea behind the book was that i
51:56 wanted to have a book that combining my
51:58 passion to cooking and my passion for
52:01 data
52:02 and i i think that data is like cooking
52:04 at the end of the day you need to cook
52:06 it
52:06 the right way and you need to serve the
52:08 right dish
52:09 one day in the future maybe i will be
52:11 able to actually create some
52:12 a very nice restaurant instead of
52:14 working in the startup world
52:16 if anybody wants to patron me i'm open
52:19 we can talk about that
52:21 but the idea of the book was actually
52:23 that let's try to
52:25 simplify it for people that do not deal
52:28 with data
52:28 so business people they don't understand
52:30 sql they don't
52:32 understand data warehousing they don't
52:35 understand
52:35 aws versus google these views for them
52:39 are very
52:40 banalic of like okay this either these
52:41 two or these two tell me how much it
52:43 cost and we're going to make a decision
52:44 what is the difference between tableau
52:46 and
52:48 aws quick side they they don't have this
52:51 feeling and i
52:52 in my book what i want to say is like
52:54 guys it's really simple
52:56 if you're going to cook it correctly and
52:57 you're going to follow the orders you
52:59 can create create
53:00 great experience and this where i'm
53:01 coming from actually trying to bridge
53:03 these two different worlds into
53:05 a very easy to process
53:09 i would say yes so your main
53:12 the main target audience for the book
53:14 are the business people or
53:17 the tech people or both it's it's mostly
53:20 for the business people but it's also
53:22 for tech people who actually wants to
53:23 understand a little bit better about
53:25 how they should direct the business
53:27 people to work
53:28 so if you think about it there is a
53:30 business strategy
53:32 that goes somewhere there and the tech
53:35 is somehow involved
53:36 but the problem is that the business is
53:39 creating a lot of pressure
53:41 on the tech side and what i'm trying to
53:43 do in my book i'm talking about creating
53:45 the
53:46 or forming the data strategy so how do
53:48 you actually understanding what is
53:49 important and what not
53:51 and where you should put your emphasis
53:53 on as
53:54 a data engineer at the end of the day as
53:57 a data scientist
53:58 is it on the models or is it on on apis
54:01 and
54:01 cleaning the data and sorting it and the
54:04 only way to achieve it
54:05 is by getting the people into
54:08 the understanding of there is a process
54:10 let's let's try to create a
54:12 some flow where we all agree on what we
54:15 are doing and what is important and what
54:16 not
54:17 and then slowly we're gonna we're gonna
54:19 increase it but first let's
54:21 let's feel comfortable with what we do
54:22 let's create the base and then on top of
54:24 it we can beat whatever we want and this
54:26 is i think my my main philosophy in life
54:28 start with something that is very simple
54:30 and stable
54:32 and then build on top of it whatever
54:35 models
54:37 breakouts call it whatever you want
54:39 buildings
54:40 you won't be able to build a building in
54:42 the middle of the river right
54:45 you need to have a ground that you can
54:47 build it on so
54:48 let's start with creating this ground
54:50 cleaning the river from the water
54:52 drying him out and then creating the
54:53 space for the building
54:55 before you starting building it and i
54:56 think that is one of the most important
54:58 parts
54:58 where i'm trying to talk about in my
54:59 book will i also learn how to cook
55:02 hummus from the book there is a recipe
55:05 uh
55:06 my recipe there you are more than
55:08 welcome to try and let me know how it
55:10 came out
55:12 some people were complaining that it was
55:16 good but not as good as they expected
55:21 but but as i mentioned it's really i
55:23 think it's really about
55:24 the taste of people so for example for
55:26 me as i said azam is the top of the
55:29 of the hummus place in berlin
55:33 for others they're going to say it's
55:34 really bad homes they don't like it they
55:35 prefer to go someplace else and
55:37 it's completely fine it's our taste buds
55:40 that at the end of the day controlling
55:41 what we like and what not
55:43 and it's completely fine if we will
55:46 decide to go in a different direction
55:49 okay thanks that was great um do you
55:52 have any
55:53 last words any tips and tricks maybe you
55:55 want to share
55:56 more i i just want to say one thing that
56:00 i think is really really important to
56:01 know
56:02 or to send it out there we are
56:06 living in a world that is controlled by
56:09 data chaos
56:11 and we all getting underwater with the
56:14 amount of requests for data that we have
56:17 and i think that we
56:20 as data people our job
56:24 is actually to clear this mess for
56:26 people
56:27 it's to educate them on the one side and
56:29 on the other side is also to
56:31 make them feel comfortable with data
56:34 a lot of people don't use data or don't
56:36 trust data and go by their
56:38 guts feeling just because of simple
56:41 stuff that happened in the past and they
56:44 don't trust it
56:45 or they now on everything that they see
56:47 they're asking for 500
56:49 other requirements just to trust the
56:51 number
56:52 and our job at the end of the day is not
56:55 to be the the
56:58 sec that getting beaten every day it's
57:00 actually
57:01 to be the ones who's going there and
57:02 showing people how it should be done
57:05 and we should be the leaders of the
57:06 company when it's coming to growth
57:07 because we are the only one we actually
57:09 can find
57:10 the gyms inside this entire surrounding
57:13 of
57:14 mud and and find it out for them and let
57:16 them grow

57:19 is something we all need to remember
