1:15 we have a special guest today
1:18 is a CTO at analytics for a better world
1:22 non-profit organization aiming to use
1:24 analytic techniques to contribute to
1:25 sustainable development goals and she
1:28 holds a professional doctorate degree in
1:30 data science from Eindhoven University
1:32 of Technology welcome
1:35 thank you so much Alexi yeah so the
1:38 questions for today interview for
1:39 today's interview were prepared by
1:41 Johanna Bayer thanks Johanna for your
1:43 help and also I would like to thank
1:45 Adonis tell us for introducing us and
1:48 introducing me to parvathi so thanks a
1:51 lot for that and let's start before we
1:54 go into our main topic of improving our
1:57 world with analytics let's start with
1:59 your background can you tell us about
2:01 your career Journey so far yeah so I
2:04 started in uh 2007 in India I studied my
2:08 bachelor's in electrical electronics
2:09 engineering uh and after completing the
2:13 bachelor program I really wanted to work
2:16 in renewable energy sector because yeah
2:18 with my background in electrical
2:19 electronics it was a obvious choice for
2:22 me to go into renewable sector because I
2:24 was also very passionate about
2:25 sustainable development at that point
2:27 even though I didn't know the depth and
2:29 width of this field
2:31 um being a very young graduate so I did
2:35 a masters in energy management and
2:37 climate change technology I realized
2:39 that collecting and using data is
2:42 becoming more and more prominent in this
2:44 field and I started learning a lot of
2:46 modeling simulation data analysis
2:48 specifically in the energy management
2:50 sector
2:51 um and I started working in India itself
2:54 so I worked in research and development
2:56 throughout uh in a few research
2:58 institutes in India
3:00 um predominantly working with solar
3:02 photovoltix uh and in the data side of
3:05 that I saw a really good job opportunity
3:08 in Singapore at that point at the
3:10 National University of Singapore where
3:12 they were collecting a lot of data from
3:14 cross-climatic photovoltaic systems and
3:16 analyzing it so I jumped at that
3:19 opportunity to learn more about data
3:20 science and I applied and I got in so I
3:23 worked there for almost uh more than two
3:25 years
3:26 um and then I realized data is not just
3:29 usable in renewable energy sector it can
3:32 be used for other fields in
3:34 sustainability as well
3:36 um and I realized I do not have a
3:38 education in data science so I decided
3:42 to pursue an education there as well so
3:44 I moved to Netherlands I pursued a
3:46 professional doctorate program in Tu
3:48 Eindhoven and I'm based currently 921 in
3:50 the Netherlands and after graduation I
3:53 started working in the public sector so
3:55 I started freelancing for World Bank in
3:57 United Nations uh specifically undp in
4:00 India on a series of sustainability
4:02 projects uh leading the data part of it
4:05 across Healthcare Transportation
4:07 infrastructure and others and last year
4:10 uh the University of Amsterdam together
4:13 with some private sector players decided
4:15 to set up this analytics for a better
4:16 world Institute and they were looking
4:18 for a CTO and uh thanks to my good luck
4:23 I got the offer and last year I started
4:25 working with them so I still continue to
4:28 consult for both World Bank and un on a
4:30 series of projects but
4:32 um yeah majority of my time I work as a
4:34 CTO there and that's basically my career
4:37 Journey
4:38 hmm interesting what do you do there as
4:40 a city
4:42 uh so uh basically what analytics score
4:44 a better world does is we connect
4:46 non-profits with research and uh private
4:49 sector expertise so not just
4:52 organization but with expertise so what
4:54 we see is that many non-profits have
4:56 questions that sometimes require deep uh
4:58 research but in many cases they require
5:01 uh things to be set up scaled uh
5:04 developed tools
5:05 dashboards visualization so for that but
5:08 they internally may not have the
5:10 capability so what we do at analytics
5:12 for better world is try to make this
5:14 connection and start projects for
5:16 non-profits either a research projects
5:18 or implementation and analytic projects
5:21 um and uh I lead some of them I help in
5:24 brainstorming idea thing coming up with
5:27 digital Solutions also we try to
5:29 understand the maturity of the
5:30 non-profit and based on that we create a
5:34 tech and a tool set because with not
5:37 every non-profit you can directly go to
5:38 machine learning and deep learning you
5:40 need to start a smaller I trade fast
5:43 because that's the only way we can drive
5:45 digital transformation so we start from
5:48 the beginning we ideate we brainstorm we
5:50 understand the maturity we have a
5:52 long-term partnership kind of a model of
5:54 working with non-profits
5:56 um and I deal with most of the technical
5:58 stuff uh data part uh we have a managing
6:01 director who looks at more the business
6:03 development uh making Partnerships work
6:06 uh way of working Etc
6:08 um so I sometimes lead data projects
6:10 sometimes lead brainstorming workshops I
6:12 even create a curriculum for training
6:15 and upskilling non-profits and others
6:20 that's a lot of collaboration I'm trying
6:22 to now uh
6:24 so what you do is you connect
6:29 non-profit organizations so you helped
6:31 on profit organizations with analytics
6:33 right and that means you set up all this
6:37 technical infrastructure
6:39 and even before that you do some
6:42 brainstorming sessions with them right
6:43 to understand what they actually need
6:45 what kind of tools they need so maybe we
6:47 can start with this brainstorming
6:49 sessions like let's say a non-profit
6:52 organization comes to you and says help
6:54 us with digital transformation
6:56 right so how do you start that how do
6:59 you work with them what things you talk
7:01 about in these brainstorming sessions
7:04 um
7:05 really we try to understand the
7:07 different
7:08 different levels of the organization so
7:10 uh let's say we can summarize into three
7:13 categories so we have uh Executives who
7:16 made like uh long-term strategy plans
7:19 for the organization then there are like
7:21 managers or project leads or program
7:23 leads or organization Department leads
7:26 who uh put together teams who Define and
7:29 deliver and Implement projects then
7:31 there is Hands-On practitioners
7:33 um who are actually implementing uh
7:35 projects and not all non-profit project
7:37 is a data project their goal is let's
7:40 say to deliver humanitarian Assistance
7:42 or to make sure that schools in the
7:46 neighborhood have access to food
7:48 electricity so their goal is totally
7:50 different but they might have a data
7:52 component in their project so during the
7:54 brainstorm what we try to understand is
7:56 these at these different levels in the
7:58 organization what level of data maturity
8:01 is already existing then we try to
8:03 understand
8:04 what are the things that is required in
8:07 their strategy for them to grow in data
8:10 science do they
8:12 um really need to invest in resources do
8:14 they need to invest in infrastructure
8:16 like you said or do they need to invest
8:18 in a long-term strategy and plan so we
8:21 try to understand this through a series
8:22 of interviews
8:24 um with different uh groups within the
8:27 team
8:28 um or organization and then we try to
8:31 come up with a roadmap but also not
8:34 every non-profit is the same some
8:36 non-profits come to us with a really
8:38 good already defined problem statement
8:41 then we help them implement the solution
8:43 for it so
8:44 um it totally depends on at what level
8:47 of maturity the non-profit is and do
8:49 they already have a problem statement
8:50 yes or no so uh yeah I would say it
8:53 depends on the nonprofit but this is
8:55 this gives you a flavor of how those
8:57 brainstormings work
8:59 just curious if you I don't know if you
9:02 can tell us or not maybe you can just
9:04 pick an example without naming maybe
9:07 organizations or if you can name that
9:09 would be interesting and then a project
9:11 that you did for them recently and would
9:14 be interesting to see like how you took
9:16 it like from uh you know from the start
9:19 and then worked on that like Define this
9:21 roadmap did this I did this
9:24 brainstorming defined roadmap and then
9:26 on the solution
9:28 uh yes definitely I can give you one
9:31 example so uh this is not a direct
9:34 example of a project because yeah we
9:36 cannot devil all the information due to
9:39 privacy and others but uh we recently or
9:42 last year uh later uh part of October we
9:46 started an academy where we uh trained
9:48 non-profits and it was a open free
9:50 program where we invited non-profits
9:53 from around the globe to apply uh for
9:55 practitioners so we received more than
9:57 340 applications from around the globe
10:01 um and we from that we selected 43
10:03 fellows or non-profit uh data
10:06 practitioners to work with us uh and go
10:09 through a eight-week program and in the
10:11 first few weeks they did some data
10:12 science courses then in the second half
10:15 we did brainstorming with them in your
10:18 non-profit let's try to identify a
10:19 problem that you would like to solve uh
10:22 and I will give one example uh from the
10:24 United Nations environment program in
10:26 Nairobi Kenya so we worked with the
10:29 fellow from there uh who had a problem
10:31 that in Kenya based management is a huge
10:34 issue and what they were seeing on the
10:37 ground was that there were not enough
10:39 um waste collection points throughout
10:41 the city uh they wanted to use analytics
10:44 and optimization models to understand
10:45 how can we improve this situation uh so
10:48 what we did is we paired them up with
10:51 mentors and who are already experienced
10:53 data scientists and we paired them up
10:55 with some of our trainers from
10:57 University doing some optimization
10:59 research because it requires
11:01 mathematical modeling as well and they
11:04 jointly did a very simple proof of
11:06 concept pilot where they used data what
11:09 is openly available to say population
11:11 densities they overlaid the road network
11:14 data and others to say this is where you
11:17 need to establish more more race
11:19 collection points but then it was an
11:22 eight feet program of course and the
11:24 brainstorming came up with a really
11:25 solid idea to take forward and
11:28 um now what we are doing is we are
11:30 having a student plus a small team
11:32 supporting them to scale this up because
11:35 that was a proof of concept it worked
11:37 fine as a test case but now we are
11:39 working with them to implement it as a
11:41 proper solution even using for example
11:43 satellite imagery to identify a
11:45 large-scale dumping grounds on ways to
11:47 see maybe in those areas you need not
11:50 just data solution but you might need
11:51 more advocacy for Waste segregation and
11:54 plastic waste collection so this is one
11:57 example where we started with just a
11:59 brainstorming and an idea we went all
12:01 the way to actually now developing a
12:03 solution and I just want to make this
12:05 very clear the data part is just one
12:08 part of the solution you have
12:10 um the other parts like you need to have
12:13 some officials you need to have advocacy
12:15 for better data collection you need to
12:18 have advocacy for on-the-ground training
12:21 for people to actually do these
12:23 segregation so the data part is helping
12:25 the official preach there but there is
12:28 much more beyond that to get the
12:30 solution to work and scale
12:32 um yeah that's uh and uh probably I
12:36 don't know if I'm right maybe I'm wrong
12:39 um but I expected the level of maturity
12:42 when it comes to data in these
12:44 organizations in the public sector is
12:47 probably lower compared to I don't know
12:49 a typical startup internet startup right
12:52 a typical uh internet company is it the
12:56 right observation what what kind of
12:57 level of maturities maturity data
13:00 maturity do you usually see in these
13:02 organizations
13:04 uh so
13:12 so in terms of digital they have like a
13:14 data science team uh they might already
13:17 have data scientists working with them
13:19 from other organizations they might have
13:21 research teams but if you look at the
13:24 overall landscape yes there is a
13:26 resource Gap there is a lot of Need for
13:30 data scientists in this sector and the
13:33 sector also have huge competition with
13:35 the private sector right because private
13:36 sector have uh a lot of Need for data
13:39 scientists as well and then the data
13:41 scientists have an option to choose
13:42 either to work in a public or a private
13:44 sector company and um in many cases
13:48 what I see is in a non-profit data is
13:51 not their first order of business like I
13:53 said before their main goal is not to
13:57 collect and analyze data but their goal
13:59 is something else and data is one part
14:00 of it so um you need also data
14:03 scientists who have that kind of
14:04 affinity to work with them who
14:06 understands the big picture and not just
14:09 start developing machine learning every
14:11 time they see some data set but to
14:12 understand where to contextualize it so
14:15 there is definitely a resource Gap and
14:17 there is a huge demand so this is where
14:20 I uh think I mentioned before from our
14:22 analytics the academy that we set up
14:25 um it was our first time setting up an
14:27 academy and we are a new organization we
14:29 do not have that much visibility yet we
14:32 do have a lot of Partners and
14:33 non-profits working with us but if you
14:35 look at it we are relatively new so uh
14:38 even then we received so many
14:40 applications from Top organizations
14:42 around the world so it really shows that
14:45 there is a need and one more thing is um
14:47 it is it was a free program and usually
14:50 free educational programs the dropout
14:52 rate is high and the retention because
14:54 it's a eight week program there can be
14:56 very less number of people who actually
14:59 graduate but that Pro level we did not
15:02 have at all because we really looked at
15:03 the motivation and the fellows were
15:06 motivated throughout the program and
15:07 yeah we had really high uh retention
15:10 rate and attendance plus the program
15:13 completion rate so yeah I have to say
15:16 extremely motivated uh resources who are
15:18 existing but there is a huge uh skill
15:21 Gap yes how do you solve this skill Gap
15:24 because I imagine that like if you
15:27 compare the public sector with a private
15:29 sector
15:30 that I suspect that the usual internet
15:34 companies who are in the private sector
15:36 they probably can pay more right and
15:39 then it's kind of hard to compete
15:40 because like people who I don't know
15:42 graduate from University or people who
15:45 are already experienced they might want
15:47 to go there because already data
15:49 maturity is maybe better there like
15:51 there's better compensation
15:53 and other things right so how do you
15:56 actually
15:58 I know manage to close this Gap manage
16:00 to find people who want to work in the
16:04 public sector who want to contribute
16:07 um yeah so how do you do this
16:10 uh what we see at least is that uh
16:12 nowadays young people are extremely
16:14 driven by uh purpose not always
16:17 Financial benefits alone uh and uh I do
16:21 not um I have worked both in private and
16:24 public sector and I wouldn't speak for
16:25 the rest of the world but uh sometimes
16:28 you uh when you are working especially
16:30 in public sector you get that sense of
16:31 purpose much more than when you are
16:33 working in a private sector company uh
16:35 it's not always the same for all
16:37 companies uh disclaimer here but um what
16:41 we try to help uh and I think one
16:45 organization alone cannot solve this
16:47 problem it is a huge problem and we need
16:50 Partnerships and we need like uh
16:52 um like a combined effort from different
16:55 organizations to actually achieve this
16:57 but I can talk about what we try to do
17:00 to help so we have
17:02 um analytics for a better world courses
17:04 uh both here at University of Amsterdam
17:06 and MIT actually are assigns to impact
17:10 co-director is currently in Boston
17:11 giving that course so we do this course
17:13 both at Bachelor level and Masters level
17:17 and this is for let's say training new
17:19 young people to know that there is this
17:22 field so everybody is not aware that
17:24 there is the stream that they can go uh
17:26 after they do a programming data science
17:29 and also to get them excited that the
17:32 problems are actually quite
17:34 mathematically challenging as well it's
17:35 not straightforward problems that we
17:37 have to solve it's quite
17:39 um mentally and this one the one you
17:42 mentioned about Waste Management right
17:44 so it's like it's a very difficult
17:46 problem like where do you exactly put
17:48 this waste collectors right it's it's a
17:51 difficult modeling problem
18:02 I get really excited so uh I we as an
18:05 organization want to inspire young
18:07 people to realize that this is
18:08 definitely possible and there are these
18:10 interesting problems to solve out there
18:12 secondly we also see that a lot of
18:15 non-profits already have people working
18:16 with data we want to upskill them and uh
18:20 plus we want to get organizations also
18:23 to invest in improving their data
18:25 maturity because like you said before a
18:27 lot of data scientists need to feel that
18:29 they are working in a more mature
18:32 organization to understand uh that how
18:34 they can com like contribute and they
18:36 need to have all the tools and
18:38 techniques and support to develop these
18:40 Solutions right so that's exactly why I
18:43 mentioned these three levels so we have
18:45 Executives we have managers or analytics
18:47 translators uh very commonly used for
18:50 then we have data science practitioners
18:52 so at analytics for a better world we
18:54 have have an academy and through Academy
18:56 we last year hosted a program for uh
18:59 practitioners which is Hands-On data
19:02 science skills this year we will repeat
19:04 that cohort plus we are adding a new
19:06 course for analytics translators and in
19:09 the pipeline for next year we have plans
19:11 to or uh like host a program for
19:14 executives as well but we need some more
19:17 preparation time for it because for
19:19 practitioners we have 8 clicks for
19:22 analytics translators it's going to be a
19:24 shorter program and for executives it
19:25 have to be two days or so because they
19:27 are getting them engaged for more so the
19:30 curriculum requires more research and
19:32 that's exactly what we are doing now we
19:34 are planning to interview a lot of
19:36 Executives who are working in the
19:37 non-profits uh to develop their
19:39 curriculum uh it is also difficult to
19:43 set up a curriculum for them because if
19:45 you look at I mean you know you probably
19:46 know uh there is course that are udemy
19:49 there is so much data science content
19:50 out there but how do we tailor it for
19:52 non-profits and how do we tailor a
19:55 curriculum which speaks to them and
19:57 their language it's also not very easy
19:59 so we are also learning in the process
20:01 last year was a success and we are very
20:03 happy for that but we can still improve
20:06 when we are working on doing much
20:08 research into developing such a
20:10 curriculum for these three levels within
20:12 organizations so as I understood like
20:15 maybe in summary you solve this skill
20:17 Gap by education and you educate people
20:20 at different levels you start with the
20:23 students from universities like MIT and
20:26 University of Amsterdam but then you
20:28 also work with the companies up Skilling
20:31 people there on all the three levels
20:33 that you mentioned
20:34 and I'm wondering
20:36 so you create a lot of educational
20:39 content is any of this content publicly
20:42 available do you have like maybe courses
20:44 from mat or university of Amsterdam
20:47 somewhere in public
20:50 so we are a huge proponents of Open
20:52 Source uh as you can probably uh imagine
20:55 that's the whole purpose of this uh so
20:58 whatever we develop for example for the
21:00 fellowship most of the lectures you can
21:02 find in YouTube uh channel of ours uh
21:05 where uh of course the interactive
21:07 sessions and the mentoring cannot be
21:09 captured completely but the courses are
21:11 there many of the lectures from our uh
21:15 from The Bachelors and Masters program
21:17 they give workshops on also specifically
21:21 about these for students uh we also like
21:23 do a lot of Showcase of our projects uh
21:26 for people to see and it is all
21:28 available in open domain and if I can
21:30 add one more thing not just about the
21:32 academy but we also have a GitHub
21:34 repository where whatever we are
21:35 developing uh for
21:38 um non-profits not the data of course
21:40 the data is proprietary and it stays
21:42 with the non-profit but the algorithms
21:44 and models if we see it is applicable
21:46 for other use cases we make them also
21:49 openly available and and we try not to
21:51 use proprietary Tools in general but in
21:54 some cases we cannot Escape but in most
21:58 of the cases we try to use open source
22:00 and both knowledge and any deliverables
22:04 or results we openly make up available
22:06 that's really cool so please send us the
22:09 links to these resources so we will
22:11 include them in the show notes but I'm
22:14 wondering maybe you can tell us more
22:15 about these courses that you have with
22:17 universities so like what kind of
22:20 modules do you have there what what is
22:22 the focus uh what do you teach there
22:25 uh so I not teach myself we have a
22:28 science to impact co-directors to
22:31 professors so one is Professor Dimitris
22:33 bertimus he's from MIT Sloan School of
22:36 Management and then of course in
22:37 Amsterdam we have Professor dick tell
22:39 her talk so they are the ones who are
22:41 leading let's say most of the
22:43 educational programs in universities and
22:45 we have other professors like Joachim
22:47 romicho who also uh take sessions uh so
22:51 it's not just us we have a big extended
22:54 team behind us who does these courses uh
22:56 just to give you in a nutshell what the
22:58 courses
22:59 um talk about if you look at the data
23:03 analytics ascendancy metrics as we call
23:06 it you usually start with descriptive
23:08 analytics which is just knowing what is
23:10 happening and you visualize you
23:13 um gets a data clean all those things
23:16 then you do diagnostic analysis where
23:18 you see why things happen and what are
23:20 the root causes then you can do
23:22 prediction so you can forecast you can
23:25 create early warning systems you can
23:27 make machine learning models you can do
23:30 some uh image detection geospatial
23:33 analysis but the last step which is
23:35 quite difficult and it is more impactful
23:38 is optimization which is talking about
23:41 how can we make things better so I will
23:44 give you a very uh quick example of what
23:46 we did with the World Bank um or what we
23:49 are actually doing now also continuing
23:51 to do with World Bank
23:52 um
23:53 we went to Timberland State together
23:55 with World Bank to study how the current
23:58 uh Hospital network intimoleste is and
24:01 do people actually have access to
24:03 Primary Health Care Centers so we make a
24:06 map of all the population points we map
24:08 the existing hospitals remap roads then
24:11 we calculate the travel distances and we
24:14 see at five kilometers 10 kilometers 15
24:16 kilometers how many people are what
24:18 percentage of people have access now
24:21 this is uh descriptive basically you
24:24 have just know the asset scenario but
24:27 then we try to do some more analysis to
24:30 see why it is so is it just the road
24:32 network is it new hospitals are required
24:35 but then the last step is the
24:38 prescriptive part where we are actually
24:40 using a mathematical model to say where
24:42 do you place new Hospitals now that is
24:45 the decision making point
24:47 because uh knowing all the previous
24:49 steps is necessary to make that decision
24:51 but that model the optimization model is
24:54 what will give you the decision making
24:56 capability saying that put a hospital in
24:59 this County or a sub-county to give
25:01 access to X person more population and
25:05 this is going to cost you so much if you
25:07 had five more you go from 50 to 100 just
25:10 example of course but giving that power
25:13 is what we try to incorporate into all
25:16 our training programs so how you can
25:19 actually go from descriptive and
25:22 diagnostic to this optimization model
25:24 and how you can use mathematics or
25:27 others to actually come up with that
25:29 decision making capability uh I think
25:32 that summarizes the core of all our
25:34 training programs
25:35 so from what I understood
25:38 um like
25:39 of course like you have multiple you
25:41 have multiple training programs uh and
25:44 they each of them have a different
25:47 target audience
25:49 right but the ones
25:52 um in these universities MIT and
25:54 University of Amsterdam who is the main
25:57 target audience is it people who I don't
26:01 know who study management or is it
26:03 people who study data science and
26:05 analytics Academy more technical other
26:07 less technical
26:10 um that's a good question they are
26:12 technical uh so we have for example uh
26:15 MBA in Big Data uh program that's an MBA
26:18 program but they have a big data uh
26:20 component so they do learn uh some of
26:22 this we also have a business analytics
26:25 course uh both here and uh at MIT the
26:28 Sloan School of Management so uh these
26:30 are the kind of students who take up
26:32 these courses but we are also uh have
26:35 been brainstorming it's not done yet
26:37 it's on seeing if um Healthcare or
26:40 education or these kind of programs can
26:43 also have such components but uh yeah
26:46 that's uh just an idea at this point uh
26:49 but uh like you asked in universities
26:51 most of our courses are targeting
26:53 students who are learning business
26:55 analytics or
26:57 um me in Big Data so all links are both
26:59 management as well as technical yeah so
27:02 they already know analytics and you just
27:04 show them the application of analytics
27:07 from
27:08 well for non-profits right foreign
27:19 [Music]
27:20 is that already no analytics you just
27:23 throw them uh how they can apply this to
27:26 solve real world problems
27:28 okay that must be quite inspiring I
27:31 imagine
27:33 yeah yeah that's
27:36 that's they are all very excited and we
27:38 have a lot of
27:40 their thesis as well so that shows that
27:42 yeah they get do get inspired and they
27:44 want to work with non-profits for their
27:46 thesis
27:47 and interestingly we also get uh
27:50 requests from other students who are not
27:52 really from these programs uh writing to
27:55 us asking if they can do thesis with us
27:57 and yeah we do encourage that as well so
28:01 these are not just open to University of
28:03 Amsterdam or MIT or any of your
28:06 Affiliates let's say universities we do
28:09 encourage other students also to come
28:11 and work with us do their thesis
28:14 um yeah to see how this actually uh
28:19 I see this question coming up in the
28:22 community in slack quite often people
28:25 come and ask hey I need to write a
28:28 thesis but I have no idea what to write
28:29 about can you suggest good topics
28:32 and yeah so maybe for these people for
28:35 these students who come and ask these
28:37 questions
28:38 how can they contact you inside and find
28:41 out how they can help with their skills
28:44 how can they take part in this what's
28:46 the best way of doing this maybe you
28:48 have like a a publicly somewhere with
28:51 possible topics
28:52 or like how do they go about this
28:56 yeah actually this is not that uh let's
28:58 say
28:59 straight forward because we usually
29:02 Define it together with non-profits and
29:04 the problem can evolve over time so it's
29:06 not like there is a list somewhere and
29:08 people just choose it have to be it is a
29:12 bit more personal uh let's say
29:14 um just to give one example so we have a
29:17 student who says we want to do thesis
29:18 with that with us then we know that are
29:21 some of our non-profits have some
29:22 pressing issues we send the student and
29:25 the non-profit in a brainstorming
29:27 together with us to define a problem
29:29 statement which works for both of them
29:31 because it's not just that it should
29:34 match what the non-profit want it should
29:35 also appeal to the students
29:37 because they are investing a lot of time
29:39 we wanted them to get excited about it
29:42 as well and passionate so I couldn't say
29:44 this that uh industrialized yet where
29:47 they can choose plea but they can always
29:49 reach out to us uh in our website we
29:52 have a page specifically for researchers
29:55 and students where they can just write a
29:57 message we always get back to them or I
30:00 think you have our LinkedIn
30:02 um page you have my LinkedIn Roberts
30:05 LinkedIn you can just reach out to us we
30:07 are always
30:08 um yeah open to all these uh we are not
30:11 that busy that we don't have time to
30:13 answer these so just reach out to us
30:15 personally yeah so we'll make sure to
30:17 include all the links you send us so
30:19 what I understood if I don't know there
30:21 is somebody a student in India or in
30:24 Germany or any other country which is
30:27 I don't know not from any University
30:30 which is not MIT or university of
30:32 Amsterdam if there is a student and if
30:34 they want to write it this is with you
30:36 what they do is they go to your website
30:38 there is a section
30:39 for students and researchers and they
30:42 simply contact you right and then you
30:43 take it from there
30:45 sounds good yeah okay and I want to go
30:49 uh back a bit so when we discussed your
30:53 different uh educational initiatives and
30:55 one things you one of the things you
30:58 mentioned was that you want to improve
31:01 data maturity of existing organizations
31:03 and you do this by upskilling people and
31:06 perhaps something more so I'm really
31:08 curious how exactly you go about this so
31:10 you come you join or you work with an
31:12 organization and you see that the data
31:14 maturity could be improved so what are
31:17 your next steps what do you do for that
31:20 uh so first we need to measure to
31:22 actually improve right so we do some CD
31:24 of interviews like I said we also have
31:27 standard questionnaires standard formats
31:30 of these uh measuring the maturity let's
31:33 say and then using the template we say
31:36 okay currently you are here in terms of
31:38 people or you process in technology so
31:40 it is not just about technology it's
31:43 about the process and people as well
31:45 um together with the management they we
31:47 look at their strategy for uh next uh
31:50 one year three year five year then we
31:53 say that based on this strategy this is
31:55 the road map so we help them create a
31:57 roadmap for data and digital
31:58 transformation so you need to upskill
32:01 um people around these sectors these are
32:03 the options for fundraising these are
32:06 the training programs
32:08 um also these are the tools that you can
32:11 internally use to
32:14 maximize operational efficiency because
32:16 sometimes um we see that a process is
32:20 not correct they have set up something
32:22 but it needs some optimization there
32:25 then we help them set it up so it's not
32:28 just about training but it goes much
32:30 beyond that
32:32 um I can give one example without naming
32:34 the non-profit is that we saw in a
32:36 nonprofit that there is already a
32:39 cloud environment setup but there were
32:41 configurations which are which were
32:43 actually
32:45 um
32:45 like not optimize that they are spending
32:48 more money than what is necessary a lot
32:51 of the unused uh resources or clusters
32:54 were not turned off or uh they are still
32:56 running which is running up costs so uh
32:59 there also we have to first of all shut
33:01 them down reduce cost but also come up
33:04 with a standard operating procedure so
33:07 that next time any team in the
33:09 organization set it up they follow a set
33:11 of criteria you know if you are no
33:14 longer using it uh you this is what you
33:16 have to do so it's not just about
33:18 shutting it down optimizing you have to
33:20 document it and make them aware that
33:22 yeah these are these are the standard
33:24 operating procedures so
33:26 um and it is again I have to go back to
33:29 what I was saying it's totally dependent
33:32 on the non-profit sub nonprofits require
33:35 more investments in people some more in
33:37 technology
33:39 um but yeah we kind of try to tailor it
33:42 to the non-profit uh the whole process
33:45 but usually maturity scan discussions
33:48 and then we create a roadmap we help
33:51 them implement the roadmap in stages so
33:53 it's not like at once you come and
33:55 change the whole organization it's a
33:57 long process uh usually we have like
34:00 short-term goals and long-term goals in
34:02 the roadmap and we implement it in
34:04 pieces so yeah you mentioned three
34:07 aspects or three dimensions uh that you
34:10 measured during the interview so people
34:12 processes and Technology maybe can you
34:16 give us a little bit more insight into
34:19 what exactly you measure there like in
34:21 terms of you know people processing Tech
34:23 what exactly you look at
34:27 like you said if the strategy of an
34:29 organization let's say is to collect and
34:32 analyze more health related indicators
34:34 just one example they are working in the
34:37 ground with Healthcare professionals and
34:41 hospitals we look at are they collecting
34:45 the right amount of data are they having
34:48 the capacity to analyze this data so
34:50 that is where resources that's the tech
34:52 part or people part or process part it's
34:54 actually uh let's start with the people
34:57 part
34:57 so if you look at people so they need
35:00 people who know how to collect the right
35:03 amount of data people who know how to uh
35:06 structure the questions let's say or
35:08 even set up that uh collection system or
35:12 a mobile app to collect this data that's
35:15 like researchers right like social
35:17 scientists or uh people who have this
35:20 background of doing uh
35:23 you know asking questions and making
35:25 sure they are not biased and all that
35:26 stuff right yeah plus you need uh some
35:30 technical experts or data science people
35:33 who can help them create or a web app
35:37 and connect it via an API to an
35:39 analytics part so it have to be a team
35:41 so including let's say people who can
35:45 set up the questionnaire but also
35:47 digitally collect the information put it
35:49 into a
35:51 server somewhere hosted so you need a
35:53 team who can do all this right so that
35:55 is people but
35:57 um so if they have a team then they are
36:00 already more or less mature if there is
36:02 no team then you understand okay there
36:03 is a gap because if you want to collect
36:05 data how are you going to do this if
36:07 there are no people who know how to do
36:09 this right
36:10 yeah uh and let's say there there are
36:13 people who can collect data but there is
36:16 no analytics capability who can analyze
36:18 this data to make decisions then they
36:20 are at a different stage in the maturity
36:23 um but if they don't have any data
36:25 collection at all then they are at a
36:27 different stage if they do everything
36:29 then they are totally at a different
36:31 stage so there is a group groups of
36:34 categories yeah I understand okay and
36:36 then the process part what is there
36:39 so in the process
36:46 part so organizationally do they have
36:49 all the support required
36:51 um and are they actually looking at the
36:53 Privacy security are they following all
36:56 the best practices out there so you can
36:59 create a form uh anybody can create a
37:02 form but are they actually following the
37:03 best practices
37:05 um are they following the right order of
37:09 things for example before collecting a
37:11 form is there a clear guidance from the
37:13 management or from the team who needs
37:17 this data uh on why they want to use
37:20 this data so you need to have that
37:22 process clearly defined and in stages so
37:25 uh yeah they know uh that they are doing
37:28 the right thing at the right order so
37:30 that would be the process
37:33 so zero processes means low maturity
37:37 right I've done if there are some
37:38 processes then it's I don't know
37:40 mid-level and if there is a process that
37:42 explains everything like uh I think you
37:45 mentioned the standard operating
37:46 procedures right if they have these
37:47 things in place if everyone knows how
37:49 exactly to I don't know uh collect data
37:53 or process data or I don't know delete
37:56 things that are not used like what uh
37:59 what are the sequences what is the
38:01 sequence of steps you need to do then
38:03 it's a good thread
38:05 yeah it's you you are saying three three
38:08 categories but there is much more it's
38:10 not that crisp right it's fussy uh so uh
38:13 yeah it is not just three levels there
38:15 is like a whole level of maturity scam
38:17 but you are right in the overall picture
38:20 yes and then the tech part I guess also
38:24 quite interesting uh you mentioned Cloud
38:26 at some point right so what are the
38:29 stages there in the tech dimension
38:32 also in the text uh Ben I would say uh
38:35 do they have let's say a collaborative
38:37 kind of working uh style because
38:41 um
38:41 you will be working yeah like git of
38:44 course but are they all working in their
38:46 local machines having local copies of
38:48 the data or do they have a centralized
38:51 one source of Truth is uh everything
38:53 accessible it's the tech configured
38:56 properly uh today and also from the
38:59 organizational side are they aware of
39:01 the technologies that they require
39:04 um from the management and we look at
39:07 that as well like in terms of Technology
39:10 uh not just whether they are using it
39:12 but are they aware of what are the
39:14 Alternatives and they have chosen
39:16 something that is best and we look at
39:18 their Tech stack we look at their
39:20 analytics stack and see uh if something
39:23 needs to be optimized so that will be
39:24 technology
39:26 and uh yeah I kind of wanted to use this
39:30 as a segue to talk about different
39:32 Technologies and analytical tools uh so
39:36 what are the tools that you typically
39:37 see or typically recommend your clients
39:40 to use how do you go about
39:44 you know suggesting these tools to the
39:46 customers
39:47 yeah
39:49 that also depends on the maturity of the
39:52 organization but
39:53 but we have a few
39:55 views let's say so if we are looking at
39:58 data visualization we do not usually
40:01 make decisions uh for the nonprofits but
40:03 we give them the options and the pros
40:05 and cons of each if they don't have
40:07 anything let's say uh just let's take
40:10 the example of data visualization So
40:12 within the organization if they want to
40:14 make dashboards many organizations
40:17 prefer one platform which they already
40:19 are using and they are aware of like
40:21 power bi or Tableau so they already have
40:24 capabilities to use it then we try to
40:26 upskilling them in that itself because
40:29 usually they have a shared platform and
40:32 the organization have invested in it so
40:34 we try to upskill them in it as an
40:36 organization we do not have priorities
40:38 for any technology to be very fair we
40:42 look at the non-profit and see if they
40:45 already have capabilities in something
40:46 then we try to identify from our side
40:50 people who can help the non-profit in
40:52 those Technologies and when you say
40:55 Technologies um we also try to tell them
40:58 if there are open source Alternatives or
41:01 um
41:02 tools like for example python or others
41:06 that are very easy to configure for a
41:08 data scientist but then connect them to
41:11 good visualization and dashboarding so
41:13 that the managers and Executives don't
41:15 get too overwhelmed with the results
41:18 that they don't they are afraid to take
41:20 decisions so
41:21 um from the technology point of view we
41:23 see a lot of dashboarding because many
41:26 organizations are at the mature let's
41:28 say uh beginning their transformation
41:30 Journey so they are still exploring and
41:33 visualizing data and when we need to do
41:36 machine learning or predictions we
41:37 prefer python or R depending on the
41:41 organization and then when we have to
41:43 develop a product and deploy it we
41:46 suggest them different Cloud options
41:48 like Azure AWS gcp and then we see which
41:52 fits the organization best and many
41:54 non-profits already have such
41:57 environment set up then we try to stick
41:59 with that and go with that instead of
42:01 changing the entire thing because like I
42:03 said we do not really have any
42:04 priorities and
42:07 um
42:07 just to add from the technology point of
42:10 view we see a lot of non-profits have
42:12 different types of data so it's not
42:14 always like just
42:16 um Excel file with so many rows or data
42:19 frames they have a lot of geospatial
42:21 data they have a lot of Text data so uh
42:24 to handle these you might they might
42:26 need different Technologies for example
42:28 uh for geospatial data they might need
42:31 more knowledge in platforms like qgis
42:33 and for text mining in Python itself
42:36 they need to know more about packages
42:38 which are especially dealing with text
42:41 so um yeah we try to identify that as
42:45 well and then suggest them a tech stack
42:48 which will fit their requirements
42:52 yeah so just to maybe summarize uh you
42:55 mentioned multiple categories you
42:56 mentioned databilization it could be
42:58 tools like power bi Tableau some open
43:01 source Alternatives then he also
43:03 mentioned machine learning and then you
43:05 suggest to go with things like python or
43:08 python packages and R then you also
43:11 mentioned Cloud this is as a way to
43:14 deploy this machine learning Solutions
43:16 and then they mentioned like Azure and
43:18 others
43:19 what are the other categories uh I think
43:22 you mentioned like the this is a few
43:23 specific examples like geospatial data
43:25 Text data and then for them you have
43:27 like specific tools do you have any
43:29 other categories like I don't know when
43:32 it comes to maybe collecting data or
43:34 storing data uh
43:36 or something like that
43:41 so we usually see these categories
43:44 currently in the non-profits like uh
43:46 dashboarding visualization we have uh
43:49 python R uh and of course for deployment
43:53 but uh by other Technologies do you mean
43:56 like uh like defining Technologies or
43:59 defining categories what exactly what
44:01 categories what kind of categories are
44:03 there categories are there because I
44:04 imagine that you need to keep the data
44:06 somewhere maybe you have like some data
44:08 warehousing Solutions or maybe you need
44:10 to collect data you need some Data
44:12 Tracking Solutions or I don't know like
44:15 what are the categories you look at
44:17 uh so data warehousing and let's say
44:20 storing data there also we uh a lot of
44:24 non-profits use like open uh prefer
44:27 let's say open platforms and there are
44:30 solutions specifically made for
44:32 non-profits so they tend to use that
44:35 um and we see a lot of like postgresql
44:38 databases because yeah it's uh open uh
44:42 we also see like copper toolbox being
44:44 used actually it is a digital public
44:45 good it is meant for non-profits to
44:48 collect data in structured formats even
44:51 including images and store it securely
44:54 and they a Kobo toolbox have a
44:56 humanitarian section which deals
44:59 specifically for non-profits and it is
45:01 registered in the digital public good
45:03 registry
45:05 um so there are specific tools that
45:08 non-profits do use and prefer and they
45:10 are specifically targeted and made for
45:12 them which is amazing and they all
45:15 follow like uh what we call the nine
45:17 principle of digital development uh yeah
45:20 that's one of the resources that maybe
45:22 the viewers are also interested to see
45:24 it's about
45:26 um developing solutions that can scale
45:28 for specifically in the public and
45:30 non-profit sector so uh yeah there are
45:33 there are tools like a cover toolbox uh
45:36 that are uh very frequently used and uh
45:40 also uh tools like like I said for a
45:43 data collection and databases they use
45:46 like postgresql quite frequently as well
45:50 then wondering what kind of profiles
45:53 for these tools I imagine that you need
45:55 different profiles I don't know data
45:57 analysts would be usually more involved
46:00 in data utilization visualization and
46:03 doing and like using these data storages
46:06 databases like postgres to analyze the
46:08 data Maybe also collect data then
46:11 perhaps the data scientist profile uh
46:14 the data scientists are more involved in
46:17 I don't know machine learning training
46:19 models also getting data deploying them
46:21 to the cloud
46:23 um right do you have other profiles like
46:25 I know data Engineers or deployment
46:28 Engineers or some other other people who
46:32 are also in the data world
46:36 um so it just also totally dependent on
46:39 the non-profits but many of them that we
46:41 see if they are at the lower levels of
46:44 maturity you see a lot of unicorns let's
46:46 say they try to do everything because
46:49 like there is a resource Gap right so
46:52 there is and a lot these these words
46:55 right data scientists data analysts data
46:57 Engineers Architects Cloud Engineers ml
47:00 Ops these are all like
47:02 somehow merged together that is not a
47:05 clear definition I think even in private
47:07 sector companies not always so
47:10 um yeah it is not always very clear what
47:13 roles are there but if you look at a
47:16 particular project I can tell you there
47:19 will always be
47:21 um in a team
47:23 there is always people who are let's say
47:25 collecting analyzing data
47:29 um there is always like uh people who
47:31 try to make business decisions out of
47:33 data right
47:35 um who are trying to uh understand what
47:38 these models are saying in the and
47:40 putting it into the context of
47:41 operations and usually uh in non-profits
47:45 we see a lot of research teams who are
47:48 looking at it from a totally different
47:51 like research perspective because they
47:54 need to know what more data have to be
47:56 collected and what more use cases can be
47:59 developed so
48:01 um we see a lot of data science profiles
48:04 but to be very fair most of the
48:08 non-profits are not at the stage where
48:10 they are deploying like large scale
48:12 machine learning models on cloud it it's
48:14 just not there yet at least with the
48:16 non-profits we work with or the
48:18 development sector organizations we work
48:20 with this is not what we see most of
48:22 them are still trying to figure out
48:25 um or defining key performance in Gators
48:28 so it's still descriptive some cases
48:32 predictive just one example is uh early
48:35 warning system so you might have heard
48:38 the Great Horn of Africa have had the
48:40 biggest drought in many many years and
48:43 how can you predict or give early
48:46 warning for these kind of situations or
48:48 governments can act way well in advance
48:50 so early Warning Systems a lot of um
48:53 prediction on whether climate using
48:56 satellite based observations and
48:58 historic data so a lot of these things
49:00 are done
49:02 um but when it comes to deploying to
49:04 scale like Large Scale Models I do not
49:07 see a lot of such applications so I
49:09 don't see right now like a lot of mlops
49:12 cloud architects in this sector yet I
49:15 understand well the reason I'm asking
49:18 about this is right now we have a course
49:21 it's happening right now we are on week
49:23 four the course is about data
49:25 engineering so in this course we show
49:28 how to use
49:30 different tools for collecting storing
49:33 and processing data so the focus is more
49:37 like how do you move data from one place
49:38 to another place in a reliable and
49:41 repeatable way reproducible and then
49:44 like as a part of the project they will
49:46 need to do a dashboard
49:48 and yeah so what I want to ask is
49:53 like people with this kind of profile if
49:55 they want to take part in some of your
49:57 initiatives
49:59 um how can they do this or do you even
50:01 meet people with these kind of skills
50:05 uh we do need them definitely but it is
50:09 not like uh nonprofits are going to
50:11 directly hire them because it's not like
50:13 there is a constant source of not all
50:16 nonprofits let's say there are some who
50:18 require this but because there is no
50:20 constant source of these kind of
50:22 projects right but we do see uh some of
50:26 these applications and uh I can give you
50:28 one very simple example so we worked
50:30 with a researcher who have developed a
50:32 very amazing solution for smallholder
50:35 farmers in Brazil
50:37 um and what we want to do is take and
50:39 it's a very impactful model they have
50:42 demonstrated on the ground but how do
50:44 you build that gap between research and
50:46 then scaling it and deploying it is we
50:49 want to create like a
50:50 um like a mobile application that will
50:53 fetch all the required data and process
50:55 it immediately give results so that they
50:58 can immediately act on it and this have
50:59 to happen in uh
51:01 um because it's not just a visualization
51:04 we are running machine learning models
51:06 at the back to give those results right
51:08 so we are we were looking for the right
51:11 set of people to support such a project
51:14 another example uh I told you in uh
51:17 tumor estate uh we went and we were
51:19 optimizing for the location of
51:21 healthcare facilities right and we see
51:23 that a lot of these use cases
51:25 recurrently appear for example
51:27 um we work together with the World
51:29 Health Organization during the covet
51:31 pandemic in Nepal and they wanted to
51:34 know where should we place
51:36 um uh covet test labs
51:38 so it's a similar problem to what himala
51:41 state did but the data stack is
51:43 different so we are actually building a
51:45 web application where in the back end
51:47 these optimization models will run and
51:49 give you results depending on the data
51:51 and the country that you feed and for
51:53 bigger countries it is actually a very
51:55 resource intensive problem because if
51:57 you look at Vietnam we try to do this in
51:59 Vietnam for uh Hospital Healthcare
52:01 facility access the population is fueled
52:04 it's a large area to run this
52:05 optimization model it requires a lot of
52:07 resources right so um yeah we do need
52:10 machine learning Engineers for specific
52:13 projects and we need these deployment
52:15 capabilities and we always are looking
52:18 for uh yeah such people who want to join
52:21 this Mission but also be aware that this
52:24 is not like constantly we are looking
52:26 for these resources it comes when such
52:28 interesting projects come come to us do
52:32 you have any open positions right now
52:35 um
52:36 not necessarily data engineering but
52:38 data analytics too because there is a
52:40 question uh if you have any if there
52:44 will be in the future any open positions
52:45 but I guess you can also talk about if
52:48 you have them now
52:49 right now no not as far as uh not until
52:54 today morning say things change very
52:56 fast but um what we also try to do is we
53:00 have a list of people and resources who
53:03 we can tap into so when a project comes
53:05 we can reach out to them but also like I
53:08 said we have a lot of private sector
53:09 organizations who are our partners so
53:12 one of the examples is our Tech and otic
53:15 is one of the founding partners of
53:17 analytics for better world together with
53:19 University of Amsterdam they are
53:21 mathematical they are a mathematical
53:23 optimization company we also have are
53:26 currently working with a lot of other
53:27 organizations who support us and when
53:29 such requirements come we first reach
53:32 out to them and see do you have
53:34 resources who can work on this project
53:35 for four months or five months or
53:38 sometimes one week or two week depending
53:40 on the project of course
53:42 um but we would really love to welcome
53:44 others who would like to contribute as
53:47 well and see uh if we can work together
53:49 and and yeah I'm always looking for
53:52 opportunities to connect with people who
53:55 are inspired to join us
53:58 and this is the same question the first
54:00 part of this how many data and this
54:02 current currently work at analytics for
54:05 a better world
54:06 uh like I said we are very new last year
54:09 we
54:13 saw let's say four people core team so
54:18 we have managing director Robert I am
54:20 the CTO we have Professor dick then her
54:22 talk and Professor Dimitris from uh they
54:25 are co-chairing or they are called signs
54:28 to impact co-directors and they lead
54:30 research Academy and others
54:33 um we also have other data scientists
54:35 who are working like kind of full time
54:37 with us one is Claudia she's based in
54:40 University of Amsterdam uh we have Brit
54:42 who's a PhD student we also have other
54:45 researchers supporting us but we are a
54:47 very small core team but we have a huge
54:49 extended team of researchers from
54:52 universities uh we have supporters from
54:55 our
54:56 organizations that are supporting us so
54:59 just to give an example during the
55:01 academy we had more than 20 uh
55:05 professionals from private sector giving
55:07 courses so all of them came from our
55:10 network from the people who are in
55:13 organizations and if I can look at the
55:15 number of projects we currently have
55:17 around
55:18 um running parallely like four or five
55:21 and all of them are um staffed with like
55:24 three or four but it's not always data
55:27 scientists we have sometimes data
55:28 scientists data engineers and others so
55:30 we do have an extended Network and a big
55:33 team but our core team is very small
55:37 yeah yeah thanks and then we have a
55:39 question from Adonis but I should have
55:42 asked this question earlier so I don't
55:44 know if you'll be able to answer it in
55:46 two minutes but we can try so the
55:48 question is which are the most important
55:51 factors that help organizations become
55:54 more data driven organizations that you
55:56 worked with and the organizations that
55:58 uh perhaps start from zero from zero
56:02 data maturity and then eventually become
56:04 data driven so what are the most
56:06 important factors that help them
56:09 um I think long-term strategy to include
56:12 data in there uh portfolio because
56:16 um
56:17 the U.S what are the factors if I have
56:20 to explain that two minutes is not
56:22 enough so I'll tell you what is the main
56:24 factor that we see is that uh
56:26 organizations which have a strategy of
56:29 um and and understanding that data is
56:32 required are motivated to come up with
56:34 projects and come want to upskill their
56:36 uh people to become more uh data
56:39 intensive in their work and they need to
56:42 make the right Investments and for
56:44 Investments you need drive also from the
56:47 organization perspective and like I said
56:50 before the Investments have to be in
56:52 three steps like people process and it's
56:54 not steps but in three sectors people
56:57 process and technology and understanding
57:00 this as an organization
57:02 um is the most important thing because
57:04 we see a lot of value in data and
57:06 analytics being added from into the
57:08 public sector organization and we
57:10 believe
57:11 truly uh from what we have seen in the
57:13 last year and uh non-profits can benefit
57:16 equally from data but uh as an
57:18 organization they know most of them know
57:21 that data is important but do not have
57:24 made it a strategic part of their goal
57:27 yet uh in many cases so I think that
57:30 that Clear Vision and strategy to
57:32 include data is the first step after
57:35 that comes all the Investments on people
57:36 process technology and
57:39 um clear understanding of uh why and how
57:43 data can be used and that's what we try
57:45 to do with our academy uh yeah making
57:48 them realize how can data help that's
57:50 not always very obvious I think and you
57:53 don't immediately see results right
57:55 especially in non-profits you cannot see
57:57 the Health Care system in a country
57:59 improving in one day it takes years to
58:02 show real impact of course there are
58:04 output and outcomes from programs and
58:07 upskilling initiatives but to see the
58:09 change it takes time so to have that
58:11 patience and long-term vision is equally
58:14 important and thanks for the question
58:16 it's a really good good one but I wish I
58:19 had more time to yeah
58:21 asked that a bit earlier uh maybe it's
58:25 the last one so this is usually the
58:27 question I ask everyone is if you have
58:29 any good book or resource that you can
58:33 recommend to the listeners I think one
58:35 thing is you mentioned all this
58:37 educational initiatives that you have
58:39 that would be a great resource that you
58:41 probably can recommend that you will
58:44 recommend to the listeners is there
58:46 anything else that you would add to that
58:49 um resources
58:51 for me I always read a lot of technical
58:54 stuff so I follow like for example I
58:56 spend every day every day at least 30
58:59 minutes and towards data science it's
59:01 very uh Tech but I really love it and on
59:05 books uh I can recommend a book that I
59:08 just finished reading it's called the
59:09 culture map
59:10 um it's about how uh different people
59:13 from across the world because we usually
59:16 live in our bubble we know what is
59:18 happening in in our neighborhood we know
59:19 what is happening in TV in media but a
59:22 world is so much bigger and different
59:24 cultures uh you have to understand the
59:26 context how people think uh lead and get
59:29 things done it's actually a really good
59:31 book called the culture map
59:33 um and I am also currently in one of the
59:37 books that I'm reading is called The
59:40 Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
59:42 I find it also very interesting I do
59:45 have a lot of Technical Resources uh not
59:47 just the our resources let's say from
59:50 analytics for a better world but others
59:52 as well that could be interesting I will
59:54 share this across with you and maybe you
59:56 can send it to your subscribers I think
59:58 it will be useful we will definitely
1:00:00 include all the links that all the
1:00:03 resources that we talked about in this
1:00:05 uh interview and I think there are quite
1:00:08 a few of them in the show notes in the
1:00:10 description and yeah with that I guess
1:00:13 uh we don't we are a bit over time so
1:00:16 thanks a lot for joining us today for
1:00:19 sharing your experience expertise with
1:00:21 us thanks everyone for joining us today
1:00:23 for asking questions and yeah it was fun
1:00:26 thanks
1:00:27 thank you so much for the opportunity it
1:00:29 was really good chatting with you as
1:00:30 well yeah
1:00:32 yeah have a great weekend everyone
