1:40 okay so this week we'll talk about
1:41 freelancing in data engineering and we
1:44 have a special guest today adrian adrian
1:46 worked as a data engineer but four years
1:48 ago
1:49 if i'm right he will correct me if i'm
1:51 wrong he decided that
1:53 of his life is not for him he wants to
1:55 be a freelancer so welcome
1:59 thank you
2:00 um it's actually five years now
2:02 five years
2:03 yes five years since two days ago
2:07 wow
2:09 so uh thank you for having me
2:11 yeah yeah thanks for joining
2:13 so before we go into our main topic of
2:16 freelancing in data engineering let's
2:18 start with your background can you tell
2:19 us about your career journeys
2:21 sure so i studied economics with the
2:24 specialty marketing
2:27 in romania and i thought you know it
2:29 would be a platform to statistically
2:32 analyze people's behaviors or like a
2:33 method too
2:35 but i discovered that the marketing
2:36 industry was mostly people that wanted
2:39 to be creative
2:40 and not so much look at results
2:43 we even had a joke
2:45 about pr that
2:48 that's basically when you throw the
2:49 money out the window and you don't look
2:50 at the results but that aside um i came
2:54 to berlin at 25
2:56 i wanted to do things more mathematical
2:58 and more logical so i started a business
3:01 analyst role
3:02 five years later i started um
3:06 working in a corporation i didn't like
3:08 it so i switched to freelancing
3:11 um
3:12 i have to say i really love the journey
3:14 um and i would given the choice to make
3:19 those choices again i would just
3:20 freelancing again but sooner
3:24 so you would skip the corporate
3:26 the working corporation part
3:29 i wouldn't but you know
3:33 okay okay
3:35 so can you tell us about this story how
3:37 did you become a freelancer
3:40 well um
3:42 in all honesty so i had worked in
3:44 startups for quite a while and startups
3:46 are known or especially you know like 10
3:49 years ago were known for being very
3:51 poorly paying
3:53 and
3:54 i joined the corporation uh
3:58 about five years into my career and i
4:01 found that uh despite the better level
4:04 of pay the level of challenge was much
4:06 lower so both the
4:08 standards
4:09 and the opportunities to do things so
4:13 i didn't like it
4:14 i actually couldn't quite adjust to the
4:17 environment i couldn't make it work for
4:18 myself
4:19 and
4:22 i wasn't able to actually perform my job
4:25 duties and i was let go um and i was
4:28 actually too uh demotivated at the time
4:31 to look for a new job
4:33 i literally couldn't see the good thing
4:35 about joining another company
4:37 and so what happened was i just told
4:39 recruiters uh yeah if you want to place
4:42 me place me on the project
4:46 so that's the end of the story so how
4:49 did it go after that so
4:51 actually he got back to me uh the
4:53 recruiter that i was talking to got back
4:55 to me with a couple of projects
4:58 within a couple of conversations i was
5:01 already signing a contract
5:03 um so my first project was uh helping a
5:06 team
5:07 clean up a lot of legacy that were
5:11 had been left behind over the years and
5:13 implement airflow was pretty nice it was
5:15 actually the first time i was doing that
5:17 and
5:18 i guess i was worried in the beginning
5:19 that
5:22 you know work would be difficult to come
5:24 along but actually the projects just
5:26 kept coming i
5:28 i didn't even take vacation for the
5:30 first year and a half
5:33 it seems like it was quite easy for you
5:35 a recruiter just reached out to you and
5:37 you said no you know what i'm more
5:38 interested in project-based work rather
5:40 than full-time job
5:42 and then the recruiter got back to you
5:44 right it pretty much sounds quite easy
5:46 was it like that
5:48 it is actually like that so when it
5:50 comes to the fit between yourself and
5:53 the job you normally have a lot more
5:55 steps involved
5:57 so you know you want to look for a good
5:59 company you want to look for a good team
6:01 you have maybe four maybe six interviews
6:04 with freelancing it's not like that it's
6:06 more or less like they look at your
6:07 history um they ask you if you can do it
6:10 what you think about it and you should
6:12 be honest because uh frankly
6:15 if you can't do it it's just going to
6:17 follow your reputation
6:18 um so
6:21 you know if
6:23 everybody has a good feeling then it
6:25 usually takes only one or two talks
6:28 there is no
6:30 job uh security so if they don't like
6:32 working with you you could get fired
6:35 within a day or five
6:37 so that's why the process is much easier
6:39 right because to get a job at a
6:41 corporation you need like as you said
6:43 four to six interviews and there are all
6:45 sorts of interviews like behavioral
6:47 interviews i don't know coding exercises
6:49 take home assignments
6:51 uh and so on right but here you just
6:53 talk they tell you what to do you say if
6:57 you can or cannot do this and that's
6:59 pretty much it or
7:00 yeah
7:01 um that sounds
7:02 way easier
7:04 why not everyone is doing this
7:06 yeah i think uh the reason why not a lot
7:10 of people are doing this is because
7:12 nobody likes risk
7:14 and there is an element of uh risk
7:16 involved so
7:18 um ultimately you need to calculate with
7:20 some kind of occupancy rate and i think
7:23 if you calculate with it at around
7:25 75 percent then you might be on the same
7:29 level as a salary depending on how well
7:32 you negotiated your salary
7:34 uh what is that capacity rate
7:37 excuse me
7:38 what is occupancy occupancy rate you
7:41 said like depending like it should be 75
7:43 or something for hours you're going to
7:45 manage to occupy and sell
7:48 so you have about 2 000 in a year maybe
7:50 less
7:51 so you know if you can calculate with
7:53 occupying 1 500 that would be
7:56 good so this is the risk of not being
7:59 able to
8:01 uh occupy all the hours
8:03 yes apparently you know the risk is real
8:07 and for a lot of people uh you know
8:10 there there is a lot of risk if you take
8:12 a salary that's equivalent to 75 of what
8:15 you could make as a freelancer and
8:18 um you know people's expectation of you
8:21 might also be different uh the process
8:23 with feedback and adjustment might be
8:25 different
8:27 some people say you know that's a false
8:29 security i would agree since i've worked
8:32 in my share of startups and i've been
8:36 on the list and i've seen other people
8:38 on the list and i keep seeing them
8:41 this keeps happening
8:43 the list
8:44 what is this
8:45 goal
8:46 i think only in the last couple of
8:48 months we've seen a few right
8:51 this kind of lists
8:52 okay yeah but still uh like a full-time
8:55 job is probably more
8:57 secure in a way that it's not easy to
9:00 let
9:00 people go
9:03 maybe
9:04 yeah and ultimately you know you have an
9:06 unemployment insurance so where's casey
9:09 going to unemployment as a freelancer
9:11 you can optionally pay it but because at
9:13 least in germany it's
9:15 kept at such a low amount
9:17 it wouldn't be worth it really because
9:19 you'd be paying a very large percentage
9:21 of a large sum of money which you would
9:24 never be getting back
9:27 and what was the most what was the
9:29 scariest part for you when you were
9:31 transitioning to freelancing so okay you
9:33 told the recruiter that you were more
9:35 interested in projects and then the
9:37 recruiter told you okay we have this
9:39 project
9:40 like
9:40 very scared here like well did you worry
9:43 about this
9:45 i
9:46 was more worried about imposter syndrome
9:48 in the beginning and
9:51 also let's say on my second project the
9:55 we didn't have a very good chemistry or
9:57 team fit
9:58 so i didn't enjoy working in that team
10:01 and i wanted to end it early which i did
10:04 and i was
10:06 it was the right decision
10:08 everybody was happy with it and
10:13 you know i was initially worried am i
10:15 going to find work but
10:18 i did
10:20 okay so
10:22 you're saying that it might happen that
10:24 because there are just two interviews
10:25 right maybe it might happen that during
10:28 these interviews
10:29 you don't
10:30 know if you're going to like the company
10:32 it might turn out that you don't but
10:34 it's fine
10:35 there's nothing to worry about you can
10:37 just say okay
10:38 looks like it's not working for us let's
10:40 part ways right
10:41 i think the biggest
10:43 scariest thing in freelancing is that
10:45 you're not so much in control over your
10:48 flow of projects so
10:51 you know if you want to get a job you
10:52 know what to do you can make a list of
10:54 50 jobs you start applying to them in
10:56 order or
10:57 five at a time eventually you're gonna
10:59 get one um it's in your power but when
11:02 it comes to freelancing it's not like
11:04 that usually the set of
11:06 uh projects is kind of limited over a
11:10 short period of time so if you look out
11:12 there you see all of them
11:14 or recruiter will tell you all of them
11:16 and if you check back next week it might
11:18 be a different set or not but
11:21 that's kind of it and unless you have
11:23 your own personal network that is coming
11:25 to you which again is kind of like they
11:27 come to you
11:28 and it's not so much in your control
11:31 um then you know you might start feeling
11:34 a little scared
11:36 probably we should
11:38 talk more about personal network but a
11:40 bit later now i wanted to ask you
11:43 about your first project so i think you
11:44 mentioned uh you talked a little bit
11:46 about that so you said that your first
11:48 project was to set up clean
11:51 legacy setup careful right this was this
11:54 the kind of services you provide like
11:56 building data pipelines setting up
11:58 airflow removing legacy
12:00 do you remember what exactly there are
12:02 the services the skills the the things
12:04 you yeah
12:06 um so i developed a quite diverse skill
12:09 sets skill set before because i did
12:11 end-to-end while work in
12:15 startups and when you do that you have
12:18 to do everything
12:20 so i was
12:21 pretty flexible actually and i was more
12:23 concerned about
12:25 being a freelancer than the specific
12:27 type of work so i have to say i was
12:29 quite flexible
12:31 so the first work was essentially
12:35 engineering programming
12:37 the second project was
12:39 data science
12:41 the third project was
12:44 actually it was a funny one just uh
12:46 today helping with an ico
12:50 so went in
12:51 office in some strange building to
12:54 get
12:55 to be all right with the data privacy
12:57 laws it was interesting
12:59 um
12:59 charge doubled my rate because it was on
13:02 short notice on a sunday
13:04 um
13:05 that aside um
13:07 i think my third project was actually
13:10 one that took about a year uh so it was
13:13 building a data warehouse and later uh
13:17 creating a team for urban sports club
13:25 houses and products
13:27 but for this one the one that took one
13:29 year for you building a very data
13:31 warehouse on the team
13:32 isn't this kind of uh
13:35 stuff usually like don't don't companies
13:37 usually have like a full-time employee
13:40 like i don't know head of data or
13:42 whatever taking care of that i think so
13:45 and i think a lot of people believe the
13:47 same
13:48 uh so you know if you are actively this
13:51 is why i think it's not a great idea to
13:53 be actively looking for work as a
13:54 freelancer
13:56 uh some people already know that you're
13:58 not the right solution just because
14:00 you're not employed or something like
14:01 that but other people
14:03 just want to solve a problem
14:06 so this is how it comes to be ultimately
14:09 if you are reliable if you are able to
14:11 deliver independently if you are
14:13 proactive
14:14 you will see a lot of interesting work
14:18 so i guess they didn't hire you to build
14:20 the team but eventually you just proved
14:23 yourself to be reliable and then
14:26 one project after another with this
14:28 company you ended up ended up building a
14:30 team for them i pushed them right
14:32 because we i built a data warehouse and
14:35 uh then i pushed
14:37 data warehouse built took two weeks and
14:39 then it took like three months to
14:40 actually properly define what we should
14:42 be looking at and to get everyone to
14:44 agree
14:45 um and then you know came the point okay
14:48 well now you're going to want to have
14:50 someone in house taking care of this
14:53 so you know hired the first people
14:55 we
14:56 got some embedded analysts because now
14:58 the teams were consuming the data
15:01 trained some people and finally hired
15:03 the replacement
15:08 and how did your services evolve over
15:11 these five years what are you doing now
15:13 is it much different from what you did
15:15 right now is actually quite different
15:18 so
15:19 i would say my last major project was uh
15:23 building um i would say a
15:26 prototype or you know not quite
15:28 production ready i think it's just
15:29 getting polished for production
15:32 um of a loading framework you know kind
15:35 of like five trend but for a specific
15:37 client for a specific space and
15:44 now i actually founded a company with
15:49 two other people one of which i met on
15:52 my previous project
15:54 and um i still do a little bit of
15:57 consulting on the side
15:59 so but
16:00 i have a max capacity of one day so i
16:03 usually try to do more fun things like a
16:05 little coaching
16:07 okay so you don't actively freelance or
16:10 consult right now it only takes 20 of
16:12 your time but uh you still do this and
16:15 you spend the rest of your time working
16:17 on a product prototype as you said a
16:19 tool like five tron and then you have a
16:21 company
16:22 what does the company do
16:24 so actually this company that uh we
16:27 started uh didn't have a clear uh
16:30 let's say objective in the beginning
16:32 uh
16:33 we yeah you know when i think when it
16:36 comes to starting companies one of the
16:38 most important thing is to have a very
16:40 high functioning team
16:42 and this is what we had and we didn't
16:44 have a clear idea of what we were going
16:46 to do
16:47 but we decided to do it
16:49 so we ended up building a
16:51 data pipeline for a
16:57 company that
16:58 one of my co-founders is invested in so
17:00 that would be
17:02 raza
17:04 and
17:06 after
17:07 doing this
17:09 data pipeline
17:10 we
17:11 realized you know that
17:13 the core component that we used for
17:14 building this data pipeline is
17:16 essentially something that we have all
17:19 data engineers have written so many
17:21 times over and over
17:23 uh so what we're doing now is actually
17:25 we're going to release it as an open
17:27 source uh component
17:30 i would guess it's about a week away
17:31 from version 0.1 so don't consider that
17:34 a launch just uh you know
17:39 so you have a company but this is more
17:41 like uh
17:42 at the beginning it was more like a
17:44 consultancy company anyways even though
17:46 maybe you weren't doing the actual
17:48 groundwork but there were people
17:50 who would go and do this and you
17:53 you were you are one of the founders of
17:56 this company and one of the things you
17:57 do at the company is this open source
18:00 project or like this project
18:02 yeah i mean right now this company we're
18:04 just building this stuff we don't have
18:05 employees we don't even have
18:08 this point
18:09 okay
18:10 really early
18:12 yeah
18:12 interesting okay um but let's say now
18:15 you're pretty advanced in your
18:17 freelancing consulting career
18:20 but back then when you started um i
18:22 guess one of the
18:23 difficult things maybe it wasn't
18:25 difficult for you i don't know but it
18:26 looks pretty difficult to me
18:28 is deciding how much to ask the clients
18:32 like should it be hourly rate should you
18:34 ask for project if it's hourly rate how
18:36 much to ask
18:38 how did you solve this problem
18:40 so
18:41 for me it was pretty easy um
18:44 to go for hourly
18:46 partly because it was offered to me like
18:48 that on the first contract
18:50 and then i quickly realized how amazing
18:52 it is to work hourly because this means
18:54 you don't actually need to sit for eight
18:56 hours in the office
18:58 you know so if you want to go after
19:01 seven hours you can go after seven hours
19:03 if you're finally taking the pay cut if
19:05 you
19:06 have somewhere to be for a few hours in
19:08 a day for whatever reason you know as a
19:11 freelancer you tell your availability
19:14 you're not necessarily expected to be
19:16 there all the time so it's way more
19:18 flexible and i find it to be kind of
19:20 like a better
19:21 quality of life and if i do want to do
19:23 overtime then i get paid for it
19:26 okay
19:27 and how did you select on the rate was
19:29 it uh did they just
19:31 come to you saying hey this is straight
19:34 we can offer take it or leave it or
19:36 this was the first project and i have to
19:38 say the rate was really low uh i didn't
19:41 know that at the time um
19:43 so i would say the rate that you should
19:45 be charging is the best that you can
19:47 um and i say that because depending on
19:50 how you position yourself and what kind
19:52 of clients you have and what kind of
19:53 skill set you have you might
19:56 be taking let's say as low as 60 per
19:58 hour if you're working uh not for not in
20:02 germany let's say
20:03 uh not for german sixty 60
20:06 yeah
20:07 yeah or euro or pounds or you know it
20:10 depends
20:12 um but you know if you're a little more
20:14 senior if you're going on site if you
20:17 know the people if you don't have a
20:19 middleman if it's not a corporation that
20:22 has a strict budget
20:25 ranges and they just want to get stuff
20:27 done and they want good talent then you
20:30 might be charging as much as 150 per
20:32 hour
20:34 [Music]
20:35 um 150
20:37 the rate depends very much you know also
20:40 what you're brave enough to ask
20:43 a lot of people it reflects more their
20:45 own opinion of their own value rather
20:47 than
20:49 now because i can ask i don't know 500
20:51 but how many people will actually uh buy
20:53 this
20:55 will be willing to give me 500. i
20:57 imagine that not so many right
21:01 and part of the reason is simply because
21:03 they think you know well 500 per hour is
21:06 just unreasonable for a person
21:08 but other people just think about the
21:10 value and if you
21:11 are doing something that is special and
21:13 unique you can get paid that
21:17 and
21:18 a couple of questions ago you mentioned
21:20 that
21:21 you
21:23 like in startups i guess you learn how
21:25 to do things end to end so you will find
21:27 doing pretty much everything so your
21:29 first job was engineering and
21:30 programming data engineering and then it
21:32 was data science
21:33 and it was built in data warehouse how
21:35 did you acquire this versatile versatile
21:39 skill set
21:41 um by working a lot i would say
21:45 so
21:46 you know i think it's good to always
21:49 find work that challenges you at least a
21:51 little bit so when i look for job fit in
21:54 a project i look to have let's say
21:57 somewhere between
21:59 um 80 and 60 percent
22:03 match on skills and this allows me to
22:06 learn on every project and the thing is
22:08 when it comes to freelancing
22:09 people
22:10 expect that you will not be skilled or a
22:13 specialist with the specific thing that
22:16 they're working with so usually they
22:18 do accept that you might not be great at
22:21 the specific technology or whatever
22:24 and you will have time to learn on the
22:26 job and get paid for it that's quite
22:28 nice
22:29 but why would they hire
22:31 a freelancer
22:33 to learn a job if they can hire a junior
22:36 to learn on the job
22:39 i think a freelancer that has years of
22:41 experience
22:43 in both doing things and in learning
22:46 things
22:47 is going to be able to learn much
22:50 quicker and apply
22:51 way more context and also handle things
22:55 more maturely than an employee
22:58 to give you
22:59 an idea you know i view myself as an
23:02 entrepreneur in what i do not just a
23:04 freelancer because i need to make sure
23:06 that i am getting paid that i am getting
23:09 clients and so on
23:11 so um
23:15 sorry i got anxiety i lost my track
23:19 yeah i i also don't remember i was
23:22 checking questions in youtube and i
23:24 don't remember but uh
23:26 yeah maybe other thing i wanted to ask
23:28 you i know
23:30 i got contacted myself by agencies so
23:33 these agencies the way they work is they
23:35 have some clients they have some work so
23:38 they contact me say hey there is some
23:40 work
23:41 please work for for our client and they
23:44 take a cut right so they offer you
23:47 x amount of
23:48 i don't know hourly rate but they charge
23:50 the client x plus 50 for example right
23:54 um
23:56 so how how
23:58 is it this how they work or like do we
24:01 as a freelancers do in like should we
24:04 work with them should we try to find
24:06 clients ourselves is it worth
24:08 talking to them
24:10 that's really up to you right so
24:12 and how you like to work give an example
24:15 there are multiple types of
24:17 intermediaries so there could be a
24:20 really big staffing agency like haze or
24:22 modis or i think now they have a new
24:24 name something with dis in the name but
24:27 essentially uh what these guys do is
24:30 they just
24:31 intermediate kind of a transaction and
24:33 you are interfacing with the client
24:35 directly so this means you can actually
24:37 create a relationship with the client
24:39 and if you don't have your own
24:40 relationships or other revenues
24:42 this is okay um it's probably one of the
24:45 worst earning possibilities simply
24:47 because these agencies will often take a
24:49 third of the project value
24:50 and they do not negotiate good rates for
24:52 you because
24:54 you know they just want to sell a
24:55 project they don't care about your
24:57 bottom line
24:58 um
25:00 so
25:01 i would say that's fine if you don't
25:04 have your own network um you know 80 per
25:07 hour is still a lot
25:10 so would you suggest
25:12 somebody who is getting started in who
25:14 just wants to start in freelancing
25:16 to
25:17 get in touch with heise or some other
25:20 agency and work with them first
25:22 absolutely i think you know if you want
25:24 to be autonomous that is a good way an
25:26 alternative if you're just getting
25:28 started would be to get in touch with
25:29 smaller agencies as well
25:31 when it comes to smaller agencies
25:33 usually they are expected to do project
25:35 management as well since they are the
25:37 ones selling a piece of work to the
25:39 client
25:40 so you know that means you need to sync
25:42 with the agency and with the client so
25:44 in my experience this is harder
25:47 because now you have you know two
25:49 different personas that you need to
25:51 make sure you understand well
25:54 and synchronize
25:55 so it's not my it's actually not my
25:57 favorite way if
25:58 if it was up to me i would either go
26:00 with something like haze because you
26:02 know you're completely relaxed they do
26:04 the finding for you or with my personal
26:07 clients
26:09 and the first uh your first project was
26:12 it from an agency
26:14 it was from such an agency so
26:17 it was
26:18 and the second one
26:20 from the same agency
26:22 okay and at which point it was not from
26:24 an agency but from your own network
26:27 um well
26:28 i can
26:30 give you a pretty simple history so
26:32 actually this agency was paying me 60 to
26:34 70 per hour which was quite low uh even
26:38 for the time
26:40 so i started looking on my own and i had
26:44 started in this time to kind of like
26:46 create a network so talk to people uh to
26:49 other freelancers to potential clients
26:52 and essentially i was able at that point
26:55 to just
26:57 answer to people coming back to me and
26:59 ask for a higher rate and i stopped
27:02 working with those agencies
27:04 okay and now you find new customers
27:08 projects without this right without
27:10 agencies yes i would say now also the
27:12 market has changed a little bit uh if
27:15 you have freelance data engineer in your
27:18 title on linkedin you will get contacted
27:20 a lot
27:21 so
27:22 it changed in a good way right changed
27:24 in a good way yes so i think you know
27:26 these data scientists that have been in
27:29 training for the last years have finally
27:31 matured as professionals on the job
27:33 market
27:34 and there is a lot of missing
27:36 engineering to support them
27:38 you know for someone it's a bit more
27:40 generalist it's a wonderful time
27:44 yeah so how do you find new customers
27:47 projects now through your network
27:51 now i actually don't look
27:53 so much for projects so
27:56 right now for example i was looking for
27:58 what we call design partner so somebody
28:00 that works closely with us with this new
28:02 tool that we're building to you know
28:05 help us find bugs and use cases
28:08 and uh
28:09 for those people yeah through network so
28:12 you know sometimes asking people that
28:14 i've worked with before or um even if i
28:17 see like a new fitting project
28:20 well but you said you still spend 20 of
28:22 your time on consulting
28:24 like how
28:25 how do you feel this 20
28:27 where do customers come from um
28:31 so the last customer actually came from
28:34 network and it was the third time around
28:39 so
28:40 he previously came as a customer on two
28:42 separate projects
28:45 it's good to have a network what can i
28:47 say when you network with other
28:48 freelancers
28:50 it happens very often that
28:52 if you
28:54 have a good relationship and by good
28:56 relationship i mean
29:00 be a decent person
29:04 i don't mean sucking up and uh you know
29:07 um
29:09 if you are a decent person you can
29:10 communicate well
29:12 then you will get follow-up work quite
29:14 often
29:17 okay
29:18 that sounds simple
29:20 right be a decent person
29:23 be honest and communicate directly and
29:25 you know this way
29:27 i think the biggest fear for people is
29:29 that you create problems when they bring
29:32 you in so the one way to create problems
29:34 is by not communicating
29:36 directly and honestly
29:38 if you do communicate usually everything
29:42 can be resolved
29:44 so how do you make sure how do you tell
29:46 the clients that you will not
29:49 create new problems for them
29:51 uh you you listen
29:53 you are out and if you see that there is
29:56 something that is you know you set
29:58 expectations
30:00 and if you see that those expectations
30:02 are at risk of not being met so i don't
30:04 know if your work is too slow due to
30:06 whatever reasons maybe it's you maybe
30:08 it's something else
30:10 communicate asap
30:13 okay language expectations
30:16 and another thing i wanted to ask so you
30:18 started as a freelancer but now you say
30:20 you do consulting for 20 of the work
30:23 what is the difference so in my opinion
30:26 from what i understood so freelancing is
30:28 more often you do the actual work
30:30 yourself but consulting is you tell
30:32 others what to do is it correct
30:35 flexibility i guess
30:39 in a way yes
30:41 practically
30:43 my experience has been that
30:45 by this definition you're only purely a
30:47 freelancer when you're coming through an
30:49 agency
30:51 because in any other situation you're
30:53 also doing the sale so you're consulting
30:55 people
30:56 um like you know if you're in this stage
30:59 who's taking care of your stack then
31:01 maybe you could use this or that
31:03 so
31:04 then it eventually ends up well now that
31:06 you've told them what could be a
31:08 solution that works you could actually
31:10 implement it for them or find something
31:13 that can help them
31:15 okay so
31:16 the the lines are blurry right you can
31:18 call yourself uh a consultant but uh
31:22 i guess the distinction is that uh
31:25 for me right now uh due to the limited
31:27 amount of time that i can spend with the
31:29 topic i'm not going to spin up your
31:32 repository and do any programming
31:34 because it's just not feasible for me to
31:36 change between
31:38 yet another
31:43 yeah we have quite a few questions so
31:45 one of the question is when you talk to
31:47 a company to a potential customer
31:50 and they tell you about your problems
31:53 about the use cases
31:55 do you get usually enough clarity of
31:58 what they expect from you before taking
32:00 a project or it's usually more weak okay
32:02 something is broken we don't know what
32:04 to do
32:06 um
32:09 it depends right something is broken we
32:12 don't know what to do is also clarity
32:16 you know and then you can
32:18 usually try to create a scope of work
32:20 document before we start working
32:22 because this helps you
32:24 define and manage
32:26 expectations um so
32:30 you know that scope of work might be
32:32 that we do a spike for two weeks and
32:35 identify all the problems and what we
32:37 need to do as next steps and we agree on
32:39 that and then we reassess after two
32:41 weeks if we're going to continue
32:45 so
32:45 how does this scope of work document
32:47 looks like is it like i don't know a
32:49 google document with
32:52 a description of a problem or something
32:54 like that i mean um
32:56 you know you can google it the way
32:59 that i do it is
33:01 quite personal i've gotten the feedback
33:02 that it's quite specific
33:05 um so i like to put in as much detail of
33:09 what goes in the scope what is not in
33:11 scope
33:13 you know things about expectations what
33:14 they can expect also about working style
33:16 and things like this
33:18 timelines
33:20 is it something that you can share like
33:22 an example or maybe there are examples
33:24 online
33:26 i
33:27 i can share an example afterwards i will
33:30 need to anonymize
33:32 okay so i'm taking a note to ask you for
33:34 that because it looks quite interesting
33:37 and then you said you do a spike for two
33:39 weeks
33:41 for those
33:42 of us who don't know what the spike is
33:44 can you tell us about the process
33:46 yeah
33:47 so it's just you know
33:50 taking
33:51 taking a defined amount of time to
33:54 refine a problem that is not defined
33:57 so when you have a problem and you don't
33:58 know what it is then you can't say
34:00 if it's worth solving it might take too
34:02 long it might yeah
34:05 so the first thing you do is actually
34:06 define it
34:08 and i guess uh like here the main
34:10 message is working
34:12 iterations right so you you don't know
34:14 what to do you don't know what are the
34:16 deliverables what what is expected for
34:18 you what is the scope
34:20 so let's take an iteration to figure
34:22 that out
34:23 and then after each iteration we can see
34:25 if it still makes sense to continue to
34:28 what extent to continue what will be the
34:30 scope of the next iteration what will be
34:32 i don't know milestones the projects and
34:34 so on right
34:37 you know the scope of work documents
34:39 i don't know if it's worth overthinking
34:41 it simply because my experience has been
34:43 that different agencies have asked me
34:45 for different formats
34:47 so you know whatever works ultimately
34:49 it's a document that
34:52 you use for managing expectations and
34:54 that you know you can refer to on a
34:56 contract
34:58 okay yeah
35:01 i by now i understood that having a
35:03 network is very important when
35:05 freelancing
35:07 so how do i go about building a network
35:10 do i do this
35:11 online i'm showing this work online or
35:13 nobody cares about online and you need
35:16 to network offline
35:18 um
35:20 you know i think when it comes to
35:22 actually building a network you're not
35:24 building really a network you're
35:26 building relationships with individuals
35:29 so
35:30 it goes without saying that
35:32 the best way to build a relationship
35:34 with someone is actually being present
35:36 and being there and having the
35:37 opportunity to communicate in all the
35:39 non-verbal ways
35:42 ultimately what needs to happen is that
35:44 at the end of the conversation uh you
35:47 know what this person needs and this
35:48 person knows what you need and they will
35:50 remember you so maybe two years later
35:53 they might get back to you and say hey
35:54 you're that guy that was doing that
35:56 thing are you available
35:59 okay so the best way to build this
36:01 relationship is i guess work show how
36:04 well you work
36:06 and then they will contact you or maybe
36:09 recommend you to their i don't know
36:11 friends who needs help
36:13 be proactive what i did actually in my
36:15 first year of freelancing um i tried to
36:18 have a target of meeting at least two
36:20 people per week so i would schedule i
36:23 would write people on linkedin and i
36:24 would schedule breakfast
36:27 like you know just before going to work
36:30 i would ask them where they're working
36:31 and find some kind of midway or
36:33 something that works
36:35 and
36:36 that was a pretty quick way
36:39 how does the message look like when you
36:41 write hey let's catch up i'm interested
36:43 what you're doing
36:45 uh
36:46 i can come to the place where you live
36:49 and let's have profit so you know it's a
36:52 good idea to at least from my experience
36:55 it's a good idea to express your goals
36:57 like why you want to meet this person so
37:00 for example i think it's important in
37:02 the beginning to meet a lot of people
37:04 that are doing the same thing that
37:05 you're doing but that had for a year or
37:08 two longer than you because this way
37:10 they have already gone through the steps
37:12 that you will be going through
37:14 um and they have already established
37:16 some network um and they might actually
37:19 be able to forward you some clients as
37:21 well and help you out with advice and
37:24 the thing is
37:25 it's a win-win situation because if you
37:27 tell them what you need
37:30 remember i was telling you about those
37:34 percentages or fees so freelancers will
37:37 often um charge each other a small fee
37:40 um if it makes sense so for example if
37:43 it's my client and i sold them something
37:45 and
37:46 i would like you to help me on the
37:48 project i might take a five or ten
37:50 percent
37:51 if i'm actually managing you on the
37:53 project and i have to you know check
37:55 your work tell you what to do and stuff
37:56 like that and i will take maybe twenty
37:58 percent
38:00 okay so you work for a client let's say
38:02 you're building a data warehouse and
38:04 then you see that you need help with
38:06 i don't know some part of the pipeline
38:08 and you know somebody or somebody you
38:11 met
38:12 before who
38:13 has this kind of skills you're looking
38:14 for so you just write them on linkedin
38:17 saying hey i have this project i need
38:19 this kind of help uh i free now right
38:22 yeah exactly personally i keep close uh
38:26 you know a small core of people that
38:28 i've worked with before and that i enjoy
38:30 but this is how you start in the
38:32 beginning
38:34 okay and then in the same way like when
38:36 you meet people other freelancers they
38:38 might contact you
38:41 and they kinda an agency in this case
38:44 because they will take i don't know a
38:46 small part of your fee
38:48 uh but still it's worth it right in a
38:50 way so you know this doesn't need to
38:53 always happen first of all second of all
38:55 the relationship between freelancers and
38:57 clients is usually a little different so
39:00 you know there is
39:03 you when you bring another freelancer on
39:05 a project you are kind of responsible in
39:07 the face of the client uh for the
39:09 outcomes so it's okay that you do charge
39:12 a buffer and you might actually need to
39:14 use that up if the person you hired is
39:17 not performing
39:21 and i think it's also beneficial because
39:23 a lot of
39:24 new freelancers are actually smart
39:26 experienced people that are too afraid
39:29 to ask for what they're worth so they
39:30 got offers for 60 per hour from some
39:33 british agency
39:35 when
39:36 you could be putting them on a project
39:37 where they would be making 100 per hour
39:39 or something so
39:45 what do you think about platforms like
39:46 upwork
39:48 i think they're a waste of time but
39:50 other people have had
39:52 their own experiences
39:55 it looks to me like you know if everyone
39:57 can access there
39:58 the biggest problem really when you're
40:00 hiring a freelancer usually is that you
40:02 don't know
40:04 what a good professional looks like so
40:06 you know if you have a good relationship
40:08 with a person you will try them out and
40:10 see if they're helping you and if not
40:12 then not but when you're doing this
40:15 online
40:16 there's no way you will know and frankly
40:18 you will have a lot of people that are
40:20 writing and bidding really
40:22 extremely low on projects stuff like
40:26 five dollars per hour for development
40:28 let's get real it's not gonna work out
40:30 but uh the client doesn't know that
40:34 uh and because of that you're wasting a
40:35 lot of time so i think you should always
40:37 consider what your time is worth
40:40 and let's say you set yourself a goal
40:43 for the month and say okay i have 170
40:45 hours i want 100 per hour on average so
40:48 i need to make 17k
40:50 give it a shot if you think this
40:52 platform is making you that money then
40:54 you know you can keep using it
40:57 okay
40:58 and
40:59 when you work with your clients do you
41:02 normally choose if you want to work
41:04 remotely or on-site or it's up to the
41:06 client
41:10 there are many projects where the client
41:12 has an expectation
41:14 so it's up to you whether you take the
41:16 project or not
41:18 in my experience if you
41:20 have developed a network enough so you
41:22 can refuse projects you will find a
41:24 remote project all you need to say is
41:26 just no to the ones that
41:28 want other ways
41:32 yeah thanks um so you said you are
41:34 working on something right now uh
41:36 on a prototype can you tell us more
41:39 about this or it's a bit early
41:41 it's it's i can tell you a little bit uh
41:43 but if you stay tuned i think within a
41:45 week i will have this first version so
41:48 the problem that i'm trying to solve is
41:50 that data loading is hard
41:53 so why is it hard because it takes some
41:56 engineering knowledge understanding how
41:57 to design good pipelines but then you
41:59 also have the problems that are
42:01 unrelated to engineering such as
42:03 data typing
42:05 unpacking data
42:07 schema migrations so
42:10 actually none of the frameworks that we
42:12 currently have out there have solved
42:13 this problem gracefully and what's worse
42:16 the loading frameworks that exist out
42:18 there have a very tight coupling between
42:21 the source concept and the target
42:23 concept so this means you need to learn
42:25 the entire framework
42:26 you need to understand it in depth you
42:28 need to learn object oriented
42:30 programming you need to be a really good
42:32 software developer to be able to do a
42:34 simple source and use one of these
42:36 frameworks
42:37 so actually what i've been working on is
42:39 a framework that makes this very easy
42:41 you give it a json
42:44 list or
42:47 a json generator
42:50 and it automatically unpacks it
42:53 optionally it types it it generates a
42:56 yaml schema that you can then
42:58 you know manually edit and reuse and
43:01 use as a loading manifest so like the
43:04 merge columns if you want to
43:06 load
43:09 incrementally
43:11 so basically it decouples the source
43:13 from the loading so if you are able to
43:15 produce a json object or a pandas data
43:18 frame it doesn't matter if it's nested
43:19 as hell or whatever this unpacker is
43:21 going to manage it
43:23 type it rename the columns to something
43:25 that works in the database and
43:27 then you can access it with sql
43:30 it looks pretty useful is it something
43:32 that you saw that many clients have
43:34 problems with and you ended up
43:36 implementing this it's something that we
43:39 ended up uh creating because of this
43:42 rasa data pipeline project that we did
43:45 what happened there is essentially the
43:47 data is available for consumption as a
43:50 conversation object and this
43:52 conversation object can be extremely
43:54 complex because it has the entire
43:56 conversation and all the technical
43:58 actions that happen like all the guesses
44:00 the bot might make and stuff like that
44:02 so if your brother is a chatbot company
44:05 right
44:05 chat about
44:07 source chatbot company
44:09 and
44:11 essentially
44:12 you don't know what you will find in the
44:14 subject because it depends on
44:15 implementation
44:16 so even the schema is not really fixed
44:18 so we needed a way to manage a very
44:22 volatile schema but also be able to
44:24 freeze it if we want to
44:28 okay
44:29 because i heard this
44:31 many people want to go to consulting to
44:33 freelancing
44:34 but they don't want to do it forever
44:37 so they'd rather be because here you
44:39 exchange time for money right but at
44:42 some point maybe
44:44 yeah you just want to get money without
44:46 spending time right is it how usually
44:49 freelancers uh
44:53 like do like a tent they see a problem
44:55 that is repeated many times so they
44:57 ended up we end up packaging this in a
45:00 product and then i don't know sell it as
45:02 a product some people yes
45:05 because they get bored but you know each
45:07 person has their own ambitions and
45:09 approaches
45:10 so some people simply go to three days a
45:13 week and enjoy a richer life
45:17 other people
45:18 start companies other people um
45:21 don't care and just work like that
45:26 other people put all their money in
45:27 bitcoin and cash out enough to retire no
45:31 joke one of my mentees and freelancing
45:33 did that
45:35 um
45:36 yeah every person has their own
45:39 dreams and ambitions
45:41 when did he invest
45:43 in bitcoin like in 2012
45:47 you know
45:48 i i i don't really want to talk about
45:50 his finances but he took whatever
45:52 there's a freelancer and i think he
45:55 invested
45:56 in january before the last year
46:01 when it was already expensive right so
46:03 what
46:04 yeah so i think he went like three or
46:06 five x or something and he cashed it out
46:08 in portugal where he didn't have to pay
46:10 tax
46:11 so like he moved that's smart
46:13 yeah yeah well
46:14 freelancer you can do that
46:17 okay
46:19 okay thanks uh we have a bunch of other
46:21 questions so would you recommend
46:22 building a portfolio to showcase your
46:25 skills and
46:26 for reaching out to new customers
46:28 i recommend building a portfolio of
46:32 products you can reuse and
46:36 basically do it again for other
46:38 customers and that's going to be
46:39 efficient because in my experience
46:41 customers if you
46:43 if they like you and you tell them that
46:45 you can do it then they will give you a
46:48 shot
46:49 and they don't
46:51 yeah
46:51 this tool that you're developing is one
46:54 of such
46:55 things right that you can if somebody
46:56 has a problem and then you can say hey
46:58 you know what i actually have a solution
47:00 for you
47:02 let's uh let's give it a try right this
47:04 is the solution
47:06 i can implement it for you if you want
47:08 to let's try and and they typically will
47:11 agree right exactly so for example this
47:15 tool that i'm talking about for data
47:16 loading
47:17 i'm personally using it to create really
47:20 good pipelines but you know it's also
47:22 usable by someone that doesn't want to
47:24 create really good pipelines but just
47:26 wants to throw some stuff in a database
47:28 um if a client wants it done commercial
47:31 grade and then with a nice dbt package
47:34 on top that has iterative uh what's
47:36 called
47:40 database compatible and
47:43 all the nice stuff with
47:46 you know rebuilding state having a nice
47:48 dimensional schema maybe even some so
47:51 for example for rasa we
47:53 even inject
47:54 templates into metabase
47:56 through the api so yeah if you want
47:59 something like that of course it's
48:01 not open source anymore
48:07 but still the
48:08 you want to show them that you can solve
48:11 their problems as quickly as possible
48:13 right
48:14 yeah
48:15 okay and uh so your portfolio but i
48:18 guess a portfolio is a good start
48:21 anyways right if you don't have a
48:22 portfolio of reusable things a portfolio
48:26 with projects you solved is already good
48:28 enough
48:29 the question is who you're talking to
48:32 and i think you know if you go through
48:34 uh agencies like haze then you will
48:37 probably be talking to a technical
48:39 person that is hiring you and then maybe
48:41 a portfolio is useful
48:43 if you are talking directly to your
48:45 clients then chances are that those
48:47 might be business people
48:48 uh people that already know you and then
48:51 they won't care about your portfolio
48:53 personally i talk to the second type of
48:55 people
48:57 okay got it
48:58 and oh what do you think about uh
49:02 like character how to say
49:04 so the question is like is freelancing
49:07 better suited for extroverts or
49:09 introverts can also do this
49:11 i'm an introvert
49:14 so i would say if you're an extrovert
49:17 that is a nice bonus
49:19 um
49:21 yeah what what you need to do is just
49:24 not get in your own way ultimately
49:27 you're the only person who can stop you
49:30 okay
49:31 um
49:32 what about so you said some people when
49:35 we were talking about you know uh trying
49:37 to stop in uh
49:38 exchanging time for money you said that
49:40 it's not that everyone wants some people
49:42 want to work less
49:45 is it feasible to let's say work on the
49:47 three months per
49:49 i don't know per year or it's too little
49:51 like is it even possible other people
49:54 who
49:55 are interested in this kind of stuff
49:58 look at the companies
50:00 so i would say i've had projects that i
50:03 could run either
50:04 between one and three days a week or one
50:07 and four four days is already considered
50:08 full time actually
50:10 um
50:12 yeah some projects might run
50:15 you know
50:16 a week if it's just like a small helping
50:19 something might run a year
50:23 ultimately you can also say you've had
50:25 enough after three months or you can
50:27 stay ahead of time
50:29 but would it be enough money let's say
50:32 income wise if i just work three months
50:34 per year or probably not you are working
50:37 three months per year and only taking
50:40 the projects that were paying you a
50:41 decent enough rate so let's say 120
50:45 multiplied by
50:47 um eight that's like a thousand per day
50:49 multiplied by
50:51 60 for three months
50:53 so i would say 60k if you live in
50:55 germany you probably have to pay about a
50:57 third of that as taxes
50:59 uh subtract health insurance for about
51:02 10k but that's the max if you earn 55k
51:06 and you're left with i think 30 000
51:08 which is actually very comfortable
51:12 outside of berlin
51:14 but if you live in berlin then you spend
51:16 most of the time most of the money on
51:18 rent
51:18 my apartment was eight years ago so i'm
51:20 not entirely sure okay
51:23 okay
51:24 yeah you're lucky
51:27 okay um
51:29 so now
51:30 i guess now you said that you are not
51:32 actively looking for new projects
51:35 but at some point you were looking for
51:36 new projects and you said you always
51:38 wanted to
51:40 leave some room for
51:42 learning for yourself
51:44 and in this case like do you have a
51:47 strategy between deciding which project
51:49 to take which skills to learn next
51:53 i would say i don't necessarily have a
51:56 skill strategy it's very much
51:59 also about what i like to do because
52:01 being a generalist i already have such a
52:04 broad array of skills that finding work
52:07 is not a problem
52:09 and
52:10 being a specialist doesn't necessarily
52:12 help me either find more work or
52:15 do much better that works so i really go
52:18 by interest
52:21 okay
52:22 so
52:23 if and
52:24 they want to use like interest can be
52:27 interesting technology or interested in
52:29 domain or interested in working with
52:31 specific people right it doesn't matter
52:34 okay
52:35 um how can i check if freelancing is for
52:38 me so let's say i work
52:40 well i have a full-time job
52:42 and i hear to this conversation and it
52:44 all sounds nice like working
52:47 three
52:48 months per year you know uh doing all
52:51 that and then developing a product and
52:54 then selling this for millions
52:56 this is all good
52:58 in my imagination but how can i check if
53:00 it's actually for me so i can tell you
53:04 the about the people who haven't
53:06 managed freelancing successfully and why
53:08 they failed and i think you know if
53:10 you're
53:11 that kind of person then maybe it's not
53:13 the best option for you
53:15 so
53:16 there are two types of people that fail
53:18 the ones that don't put themselves out
53:20 there because they think ah it's fine
53:22 i'll find the work when i need it but
53:24 you know it's
53:25 you need to build a network and then
53:27 this is not a
53:29 deterministic
53:31 action if you do this this will happen
53:33 it
53:34 might happen might not so you you need
53:36 to keep at it
53:38 and the second thing is you definitely
53:40 need to ask for a decent rate if you're
53:43 too afraid to ask for a good rate if you
53:46 are asking for the equivalent of a
53:48 salary or something like that then you
53:50 will fail because you won't be able to
53:52 make ends meet due to the added risk and
53:55 occupancy rate and all that
53:58 so you said a good occupancy rate is uh
54:01 75
54:03 yeah
54:04 and uh so it means that you work only 75
54:07 percent of the year
54:09 where it means you would be working
54:11 1700 hours or 1700 yeah hours uh
54:17 yeah and you don't control when this uh
54:20 when you work when you don't like a
54:22 project might end and it might take i
54:24 don't know uh two weeks to find a new
54:26 project right and so these two weeks
54:28 you're not working yes
54:31 in all honesty i've only really had down
54:34 time when we had the first corona wave
54:36 and everybody panicked and they cut all
54:38 the contracts
54:43 yeah i think you said that market is
54:44 different right now so talking about
54:46 berlin uh because there's a question
54:48 about berlin like is it
54:50 the market in berlin currently good for
54:52 freelancers in terms of pay
54:54 opportunities and
54:56 everything
54:58 yes but you do need to put yourself out
55:00 there and make your own opportunities if
55:02 you're going to wait for the few
55:03 projects that come at you then you will
55:05 compete with the other people who are
55:07 doing the same so unless you're
55:10 as good
55:11 or better than them
55:13 um you know it's going to be hard but i
55:16 would say one of the most important
55:18 things to being able to take freelancing
55:20 job is to be available
55:22 so
55:24 yeah i think
55:26 you will find something
55:28 okay
55:29 and
55:30 in terms of expectations from clients so
55:33 let's say if we compare a
55:35 full-time employee from a company
55:37 and a freelancer
55:39 does would a company expect more from a
55:42 freelancer in terms of i don't know
55:44 being more proactive driving decision
55:46 making um like i don't know
55:49 coming up with architectural proposals
55:52 or not like or all of that is in the
55:55 scope of working document that you
55:57 mentioned i would say people are people
55:59 so it really depends i'm the kind of
56:01 person that does get involved
56:04 even if
56:05 i just can't let it go
56:07 um
56:08 so
56:09 you know
56:10 other people
56:12 even as employees
56:14 you have to back them to do their thing
56:16 or you know they don't get involved they
56:18 don't they're not proactive and so on
56:20 um
56:21 i would say if you are a proactive
56:24 person that wants to get stuff done
56:27 uh you will get access to the best
56:28 clients and the best rates
56:31 okay and again just to make it clear by
56:34 practice you mean
56:35 uh
56:36 you said putting
56:38 yourself out there and by that you mean
56:40 networking with people
56:42 uh keeping in touch with i don't know
56:44 past clients or exactly i mean you don't
56:47 necessarily need to keep in touch with
56:48 past clients but yes keep networking
56:50 maintain a healthy network
56:53 i would say when you work
56:55 make sure you care like actually care
56:58 about the outcome of the project care
57:00 that it's a good outcome for the client
57:02 and the good outcome for the client
57:03 sometimes might be that the client is
57:05 happy and not necessarily
57:07 what you think is a good outcome
57:10 but if you actually do what people want
57:13 and help them and advise them then
57:16 they will usually find this so
57:18 invaluable that they will want to keep
57:19 working with you all the time
57:22 okay
57:23 what do you think about working for two
57:25 clients simultaneously
57:26 does it make sense does it happen
57:28 um so you know some people advise you to
57:31 do that simply like don't put all your
57:33 eggs in one basket i would say yeah
57:35 don't put all your eggs in one basket
57:37 and have some savings because focus is
57:39 important and if you want to do a good
57:41 job i think you know it's best that you
57:43 do focus
57:45 it might also depend on you if you have
57:47 the capacity to
57:49 do multiple clients i like to usually
57:51 have one main client and one side client
57:54 that is small enough
57:56 just for you know some extra learning or
57:59 networking so sometimes i take these
58:01 small projects just for
58:04 enlarging the network but
58:07 otherwise i would say just focus on one
58:10 uh if so
58:11 to make the best money just focus on one
58:14 so how does it look in practice let's
58:16 say you spend i don't know three days on
58:18 your main client one day on your
58:22 other client and i don't know one day
58:24 chilling on the beach
58:26 it could be like that i'm not the
58:27 chilling on the beach kind of guy if i
58:30 go to the beach then i'm going to be
58:31 walking around for the whole day but
58:34 yeah okay okay and in terms of managing
58:38 expectations like how do you manage
58:40 expectations of this
58:41 second client you yeah i guess you need
58:44 to tell them hey i actually have my
58:46 primary clients so
58:48 all i do for you will be like a
58:49 background activity for me sorry about
58:51 that
58:52 yes of course you need to tell them
58:54 ahead of time and you need to be very
58:56 clear because
58:57 otherwise they will have expectation for
58:59 you to answer and communicate in times
59:01 when you won't be able to and if you do
59:04 that then you will have a problem
59:08 okay
59:09 and i know that we should be wrapping up
59:11 i remember
59:13 no
59:14 we actually talked in person a month ago
59:16 i think and i was asking you about that
59:19 and he said there is some cooperative
59:21 freelance cooperative
59:23 can you tell us more about this what is
59:25 this and how to get in
59:27 um so to get in um i will send a link i
59:31 guess either to you
59:33 or yeah i think to you and then you can
59:35 send it further
59:37 essentially it's a slack group
59:39 that is a bunch of data freelancer that
59:42 are
59:43 loosely cooperating some of them know
59:45 each other well
59:48 and
59:49 we
59:50 do
59:51 you know this thing where we help each
59:53 other with clients
59:56 so we tell each other the projects that
59:58 we find we do take fees
1:00:01 but it's usually much smaller than what
1:00:03 will happen outside of the group
1:00:05 um
1:00:06 [Music]
1:00:07 yeah and there is also you know a little
1:00:09 bit of a mastermind network that allows
1:00:11 it
1:00:13 is it germany specific or it's worldwide
1:00:16 i started it with uh people from berlin
1:00:21 i started inviting some further people
1:00:23 but i have not advertised it broadly so
1:00:26 you know it's just kind of organically
1:00:28 grown to 20 something people
1:00:30 um
1:00:31 yeah there is more work there than we
1:00:34 can take usually so
1:00:36 definitely a good place for people who
1:00:38 want to start freelancing
1:00:47 uh would you suggest people to start a
1:00:49 similar cooperative let's say if they
1:00:51 are not from berlin if they are
1:00:54 i don't know from some other
1:00:55 geographical area
1:00:57 would you suggest studying like that for
1:00:58 them if you are starting freelancing i
1:01:00 suggest starting broader so rather than
1:01:03 creating a very narrow interest group
1:01:06 like a freelance cooperative i would say
1:01:08 create a broader interest group so like
1:01:10 a bi group for your or data group for
1:01:13 your hometown
1:01:14 and meet these people create personal
1:01:17 relationships and they will be your
1:01:18 network
1:01:21 any networking events in berlin that he
1:01:23 would recommend for freelancers
1:01:29 i wouldn't know off the top of my head
1:01:31 but you know in this
1:01:33 group sometimes we meet
1:01:36 yeah okay
1:01:39 well i think it's all we have time today
1:01:42 there are still quite a few questions
1:01:44 both in live chat and uh
1:01:46 slider sorry for not being able to cover
1:01:48 all of them so there is a lot of
1:01:50 interest in the topic thanks adrian for
1:01:52 coming today for
1:01:54 answering all these questions for for
1:01:56 sharing your experience and thanks
1:01:58 everyone for joining us today and for
1:01:59 asking questions
1:02:02 uh maybe last thing actually i forgot to
1:02:04 ask usually ask at the end is what's the
1:02:06 best way to get in touch with you is it
1:02:08 like linkedin is it this uh freelance
1:02:11 cooperative
1:02:12 email
1:02:13 um
1:02:14 yeah if you're on this co-op and one is
1:02:17 like me
1:02:18 slack is going to be faster but
1:02:21 i'm checking linkedin quite regularly
1:02:23 when i can
1:02:24 okay thanks i think i
1:02:27 accidentally forget to ask this at the
1:02:29 end but again thanks
1:02:30 thanks for for joining us today
1:02:32 and yeah i guess that's that would be it
1:02:35 thank you have a nice weekend and um
