0:00 everybody for coming today for our event
0:03 so this event is brought to you by
0:05 datatalks.club which is the community of
0:07 people who love data
0:08 we have weekly events and today is one
0:11 of them so we have two types of events
0:13 one is a podcast event like we have
0:17 right now with ben where we just talk
0:19 about different topics
0:20 and at any moment of time you can jump
0:22 in and ask a question and then we have a
0:24 different type of event
0:26 which we call webinars we have them on
0:28 thursdays on tuesday
0:30 sorry and if you want to see what kind
0:33 of events we have you can just go to our
0:35 website
0:36 datatalks.club slash events html and you
0:39 can see a list
0:39 so we have a couple of events lined up
0:43 for the next weeks
0:44 so just go there and check and
0:48 that's probably it so if you want to

1:14 and so i'll
1:18 just quickly pull my notes
1:23 and are you ready to start
1:28 yep i'm ready okay um
1:32 so this week we will talk about public
1:34 speaking
1:35 and we have a special guest today um ben
1:38 taylor and ben
1:40 is the chief ai evangelist at data robot
1:43 and if you use linkedin you must have
1:45 seen ben in your feed quite often
1:48 and if you don't you most likely saw him
1:50 on
1:51 one of the conferences or webinars or
1:54 somewhere on the internet so ben does a
1:57 lot of talks
1:58 at least once per week if i'm correct
2:00 maybe even more often
2:02 yeah it's it's a lot i i feel like it is
2:04 every week
2:06 um yeah so
2:09 yeah naturally yeah it's it was very
2:12 difficult for me to think of anyone
2:14 better for this talk than you and as we
2:17 see
2:18 you're right now sitting in a car and
2:22 so being ready to give a
2:25 talk like to do public speaking to be on
2:27 a podcast that
2:28 uh you know in any situation not in your
2:31 studio
2:32 this is also a very special moment
2:34 because typically people see you
2:36 in the studio in this uh you know like
2:39 you have some light bulbs there
2:41 like it's uh with maybe a
2:44 good microphone and you know all this
2:47 studio setup but today is different so
2:49 we
2:51 caught burn driving right
2:54 yeah but i'm stuck right now so i'm
2:56 being safe
2:57 okay that's good okay so
3:00 welcome back thanks for finding time in
3:02 your thai schedule to talk to us
3:04 and yeah welcome
3:08 yeah i'm excited to be here i i love
3:10 this topic i think it's very important
3:12 for anyone that's listening
3:14 anyone can become a great speaker and i
3:17 and i've definitely been a bad speaker
3:18 before
3:20 so you anything you want to become
3:22 better at you can get better through
3:24 practice
3:25 and so practice is important but it's
3:27 also there's a few rules that i've
3:29 learned along the way
3:30 that are useful okay totally short
3:33 circuit people's learning
3:35 yes we will definitely get back to uh to
3:37 these to these rules but maybe before we
3:39 go to that maybe you can just briefly
3:41 tell us about your background
3:43 so i know a bit about yours you because
3:46 i followed you in linkedin
3:48 uh but yeah maybe you can just tell us a
3:51 bit about your career journey so far
3:54 yeah so i studied chemical engineering
3:56 in college
3:57 and i planned on going to medical school
4:00 i'm really glad that didn't happen
4:02 i don't think i would have been very
4:03 happy being a doctor um i
4:05 went and worked for intel and micron for
4:08 five years in semiconductors so this is
4:10 semiconductor manufacturing
4:12 it was nan flash memory and i worked in
4:16 photolithography process control fault
4:18 detection yield analysis
4:20 and what that essentially says is i got
4:21 a really good sampling of applied data
4:24 in semiconductor um and then i went
4:26 worked at a hedge fund as a quant
4:28 building stock models and then i went
4:31 and joined
4:32 a sequoia capital company called hirevue
4:34 and i was their chief data scientist so
4:36 i builds out their data science team and
4:38 i helped them launch their ai product
4:40 and then four years ago i got the itch
4:42 to go do a startup
4:43 um that i co-founded with david gonzalez
4:46 and that was a deep learning automl
4:48 startup called
4:48 zeph.ai and we joined uh we were
4:52 acquired by data robot
4:53 a year ago and i've been working for
4:55 data robot ever since
4:57 okay i actually didn't know that it was
4:59 acquired so
5:00 i didn't know that part of the story
5:03 okay that's uh
5:04 congratulations well a bit late maybe
5:10 yeah it's um it's so funny going to do a
5:13 startup
5:14 you it's 100 times harder than you
5:16 thought it would be and so i feel like
5:18 after going through that process
5:20 i if if someone's a founder i feel like
5:23 they're
5:23 a brother or sister to me automatically
5:27 even if they're a competitor there's
5:29 just a very special thing
5:31 a special place in my heart for people
5:32 that understand the pains of payroll
5:35 in delivering on contracts
5:40 so just i think one thing i forgot to
5:42 mention that if at any moment of time
5:44 you have a
5:45 question to ben so there is a pinned
5:47 link in the live chat that you can just
5:49 click
5:50 and then ask any question on slider and
5:52 then
5:53 as we move along i will ask this
5:55 question so
5:57 let's start so what is evangelism
6:00 and what does a nai chief evangelist do
6:04 yeah that's a great question so
6:06 evangelism that's something that a lot
6:07 of tech companies have
6:09 and so someone who's an evangelist they
6:12 could be
6:13 a professional speaker or or be a
6:15 frequent speaker where they're out
6:17 speaking uh for my role it's
6:20 very much focused around um
6:23 not just evangelizing the data robot
6:25 product but figuring out how to
6:27 evangelize ai so how do we get companies
6:29 excited about using ai even if they
6:31 don't want to use
6:32 our particular product how do we get
6:33 people
6:36 you know thinking about the art of the
6:38 possible so how can we stir the creative
6:40 juices and get them thinking about what
6:42 could they do this year with ai
6:45 for some people i joke and say i'm the
6:47 ai missionary so i'm
6:49 you know if you didn't think your
6:50 company needed ai i
6:52 there's a good chance i can convince you
6:53 otherwise um with the right format
6:56 and to be a little bit more specific i
6:59 see evangelism
7:00 sitting in between product and
7:02 engineering and marketing
7:04 so marketing for a tech company is very
7:06 complicated because
7:08 a lot of marketing can be it's technical
7:12 so you have to you never want to have
7:14 marketing that feels
7:16 misleading or it's incorrect or
7:18 embarrassing because
7:20 for people that are traditionally
7:21 marketing they might not have the
7:22 technical background
7:24 to get the messaging right and so a lot
7:27 of times i'm reviewing
7:28 blog content and some of the messaging
7:30 stuff but
7:31 for me but i think that's a lot of fun
7:33 because
7:34 it feels like it's a tough challenge so
7:38 if you and i are competing on writing a
7:40 blog article
7:41 about ai or if anyone listening if we're
7:43 competing together
7:45 how can you and this all goes back to
7:47 speaking so how can you create
7:49 content that changes an audience or
7:52 moves them emotionally and the criticism
7:54 i'll throw out to end
7:55 this rant is um the common criticism is
7:58 people
7:59 fall into the rational mindset and
8:01 that's the features and speeds
8:03 so i want you to like my product because
8:05 it has one more feature
8:06 than the competition or i want you to
8:08 buy my hardware because it's a little
8:10 faster
8:10 than nvidia or intel and
8:13 that's a very weak argument because
8:16 that's not why
8:18 humans don't humans like to make
8:20 emotional decisions and then they like
8:22 to confirm their emotional decisions
8:24 with
8:24 rational insights the reverse doesn't
8:27 really work to just sell you on rational
8:30 arguments it's
8:31 yeah so i so i love studying that part
8:33 of it so
8:34 this is like your role is to speak
8:38 in public then like
8:41 promote ai promote your company as well
8:44 and uh did you also say you kind of you
8:47 are an editor in a blog so you also
8:50 review
8:50 the review yeah and we also um
8:54 we're also starting up a program this
8:56 year where we're going to be doing
8:57 active research
8:58 um where we where i am still programming
9:01 i am still doing
9:02 ai applications but normally when you do
9:05 r d
9:06 it cater it answers to products and it
9:09 answers to customer needs
9:11 or this will be very very different i'm
9:12 very excited about it this year where
9:14 we're doing
9:16 we're doing r d that answers to
9:19 the attention needs of the market so can
9:21 we
9:22 do an ai application that is inspiring
9:25 for you an ai application that's
9:26 relatable can we do an ai application
9:28 that
9:29 furthers this cause of everyone needs ai
9:33 and so that that's a very exciting thing
9:35 for me to be working on this year
9:37 and then the last thing i'll say is
9:40 really all of this is about
9:41 understanding a process
9:43 so it really isn't about me speaking
9:45 it's about can i
9:46 understand the recipe or the process for
9:50 developing an excellent keynote or or
9:53 training someone else to go give it
9:54 instead
9:55 and that's where things get really
9:56 exciting because you always want to
9:58 you know you hear people say nail it and
10:01 scale it with product but that's also
10:03 true with
10:04 you know individuals it's true with
10:05 yourself it's also true with marketing
10:07 if you can nail a process then you can
10:10 critique it you can measure it
10:12 and you can scale it so that yeah that's
10:14 really the
10:15 my obsession is around scaling okay
10:18 so this is like probably
10:21 uh like a way of scaling it like
10:25 i don't know if maybe it's a bit
10:26 ambitious but like being on this podcast
10:29 and then talking about public speaking
10:31 is like
10:32 kind of a way of scaling and writing
10:33 about educating other people how to do
10:36 uh oh yeah in public yeah so if for
10:39 anyone listening
10:40 if they can go give a better talk about
10:43 ai
10:44 that motivates an audience and changes
10:45 them that honestly helps me
10:47 so okay uh
10:50 do you know uh like i'm not sure like if
10:53 there is any difference between
10:55 evangelism and the developer advocacy
10:58 advocacy do you know if
10:59 like is it synonyms or like it's a bit
11:01 different maybe there's some overlap
11:02 there there could be some overlap
11:05 some of these titles are a little funny
11:07 um because
11:09 what do you actually do like it yeah so
11:12 i think
11:13 you could look at different companies
11:14 that have evangelism roles and what they
11:16 actually do could be very different
11:19 between the two of them it's like data
11:21 science right so
11:23 like you don't really know what
11:26 to what a company means by data science
11:28 until you actually see like the job
11:30 description and talk to them and to
11:31 figure out what they actually need
11:34 yeah yeah exactly i i i do like thinking
11:37 of evangelism
11:38 as um fitting in between marketing and
11:42 engineering because they have to they
11:45 have to know
11:45 both worlds they have to understand and
11:48 actually for me
11:49 i really like being stuck in the middle
11:51 and so at higher view i was stuck in the
11:53 middle
11:54 between the data science team and the io
11:55 psychologist so the i o psychologists
11:57 they're the ones that develop
11:59 hiring assessments you know you're going
12:01 to go fill out this assessment to go
12:02 work at a bank or something and they
12:04 want to
12:04 flush out your personality traits and
12:07 map that to
12:08 potential performance in the future
12:12 and so i love being in the middle
12:14 because when you're in the middle
12:15 and you can understand both sides you
12:17 you suddenly have a very useful
12:19 perspective
12:20 so if you're just in marketing you're
12:22 not going to appreciate engineering
12:24 you're not going to even understand how
12:25 to communicate and if you're just in
12:26 engineering
12:27 you're going to fall prey to the
12:29 rational mindset
12:31 and a lot of factoids that don't matter
12:34 emotionally they don't move the needle
12:37 and so by living in the middle
12:38 it it yeah so maybe if that's a theme
12:41 for me
12:42 i just want to spend my whole career
12:43 living in the middle of whatever that is
12:45 like whatever the next thing is
12:46 i just want to be right in the middle
12:48 because you get a very unique point of
12:50 view
12:53 so yeah well now you give one talk a
12:56 week right even more often maybe
12:58 but like i imagine that it wasn't the
13:02 case for you
13:03 all the time right do you remember your
13:05 first experience
13:06 uh speaking in public
13:09 yeah so i think it actually started when
13:11 i was at intel and micron so i remember
13:13 i was so excited um so if you want to
13:17 if you want to go back in time and find
13:18 the worst talks that ben taylor has ever
13:20 given on planet earth
13:21 they were inside intel and micron so i
13:24 remember
13:25 i was so obsessed so i had a math minor
13:27 at one point in my life i thought i
13:29 wanted to be a mathematician
13:30 i was so obsessed about some of this
13:32 math regarding
13:34 controllers so this math is pretty
13:36 intense like it's state space
13:38 linear algebra and i remember giving a
13:40 talk about some
13:42 breakthrough on a certain type of
13:44 controller for like state tracking
13:46 and the math was intense so like imagine
13:48 me like sitting you down to walk you
13:50 through an hour of math
13:51 like you and i are technical but even
13:54 today
13:54 you'd be like i'll pass no thank you
13:58 and i remember giving that talk and i i
14:00 think i wrote the whole talk
14:01 is it beamer or latex like it was just
14:04 awful like you should never give a
14:05 presentation in beamer
14:07 and so i'm giving this talk and i
14:09 remember looking over and there's a
14:10 senior engineer at the end of the table
14:11 and these rooms are dark we have the
14:13 lights off
14:14 and he's asleep with his head cocked
14:16 back and his mouth is wide open just
14:19 leaping during my talk and at the time i
14:22 think i took offense i just thought like
14:23 oh my gosh like
14:24 i can't believe this individual is
14:26 missing out on this good content i'm
14:28 sharing
14:29 but today i would say i gave an i gave a
14:32 terrible talk
14:33 i didn't understand my audience and it
14:37 you know it was awful or where today i
14:41 you know i i care a lot about the
14:44 audience feedback
14:46 because it's a it's a point of reference
14:49 did you give a good talk could you have
14:50 given a better talk
14:51 you need to consult with the audience
14:53 after the talk to kind of find out
14:55 um and you're not gonna make everyone
14:56 happy like you're you're always gonna
14:58 have some people that
14:59 it doesn't matter how good of a speak
15:00 you are speaker you are you're always
15:02 gonna have some people that didn't like
15:03 the talk or they've got some criticism
15:05 and then the the challenge that i fall
15:07 into is i've been criticized for giving
15:09 talks that are too technical i've been
15:12 criticized for giving talks that weren't
15:13 technical enough
15:14 and i've had those criticisms on the
15:16 same talk so that's an example of like
15:18 well
15:19 you're not going to make everyone happy
15:21 but you
15:22 but there's always room for improvement
15:25 and yeah so i yeah i've learned a lot
15:27 since then that was
15:29 seven years ago yeah eight years ago
15:32 making an engineer fall asleep
15:34 and i gave plenty of terrible talks
15:36 since then
15:37 but i my terrible talks are becoming
15:40 less frequent now
15:41 okay and i yeah so
15:45 that was like maybe the time when you
15:47 would give i don't know one talk a year
15:49 to the time yeah one talk per week
15:52 yeah i guess it happened you said in
15:54 like seven eight years
15:57 yeah i started to speak so higher view
16:00 they helped my speaking career so when i
16:02 started a higher view they needed
16:03 someone out there talking about ai and
16:05 data science
16:06 in the hr space so i started going to hr
16:08 conferences
16:10 and and i i think i kind of made my
16:13 a name for myself right out of the gate
16:15 and i
16:16 it's interesting because right out of
16:18 the gate i made a name for myself
16:21 maybe not because i was a great speaker
16:23 but because i was controversial
16:25 like i was i was rough around the edges
16:28 i remember presenting a psyop i think i
16:31 was one of the only data science
16:32 speakers there
16:33 and i was saying a lot of things that
16:36 were
16:36 um pretty i don't want to say
16:40 disrespectful but like
16:41 i remember i i gave a talk to an
16:45 audience
16:45 and i'm essentially telling the entire
16:47 i'm insulting the entire audience that's
16:48 a rule of storytelling
16:50 and speaking don't insult the audience
16:52 but i remember insulting the entire
16:54 audience and i said
16:55 you guys don't understand statistics
16:57 like essentially i'm insulting the
16:58 entire
17:00 industrial occupational psychology field
17:02 i'm saying you guys don't
17:03 understand statistics and so i'm going
17:05 to teach you how to do proper
17:07 cross-validation
17:08 and this talk was seven years ago in
17:10 philadelphia and i think i'm showing
17:11 them
17:12 how to do k-folding because i found out
17:14 they weren't doing that and so i was
17:16 upset about that
17:17 and i remember and i'm not thinking i'm
17:19 being the dick i'm not thinking i'm
17:21 being mean
17:22 i just give us talk like hey you guys
17:23 need to know this you're welcome
17:25 and i remember i remember
17:28 seeing i ran into someone six months
17:31 later who had been at the talk
17:34 up in park city utah and they were
17:35 saying hey um remember that talk you
17:37 gave in philadelphia
17:38 i'm like oh yeah like i'm thinking like
17:40 a compliment's coming like oh yeah
17:42 and he said yeah you were a real ass
17:45 i was like oh okay tell me why and and
17:48 he said
17:49 he essentially said like it was
17:51 interesting because
17:52 he agreed with everything i said he said
17:54 you were right
17:55 but what you said but he kind of said we
17:57 didn't like hearing it from you
17:59 and and part of that i don't want to
18:01 gossip or like go down another path but
18:03 it's essentially saying like i'm not a
18:04 nio psychologist i'm an outsider i don't
18:06 have a phd in io and i'm essentially
18:08 raining on their parade and insulting
18:10 their career but since then i've
18:12 i don't think i've really had i'm not a
18:14 controversial speaker
18:16 anymore like i i don't there are tricks
18:20 in storytelling where you actually can
18:21 offend the audience
18:23 but you have to be really careful how
18:24 you do it and you actually don't you
18:26 never want to leave a talk where the
18:28 audience still feels offended
18:31 so it's um yeah it's interesting so
18:35 i i guess to finish the thought is
18:37 higher view i started doing a lot of
18:38 speaking so i was you know
18:39 speaking all over the u.s i got to speak
18:41 in sydney and then when i went and did
18:43 our startup i started speaking even more
18:45 so i spoke in south africa madrid
18:48 dublin um all over the us and i got to
18:51 the point where
18:52 i started to get invited to go speak to
18:56 some impressive companies so like um
18:59 red bull goldman sachs procter gamble
19:02 amazon
19:03 different companies they like a rocket
19:05 company says hey will you please come
19:06 present to us
19:08 and and those invites were coming
19:10 because some of those employees had seen
19:11 my other talks
19:12 and so for me that that has been some of
19:16 them the most fun i've had
19:17 have been giving private talks to these
19:19 companies
19:21 um because you meet some really
19:23 interesting people
19:26 but yeah i'm happy to explain why
19:28 because i i think it's important for the
19:30 audience to know
19:31 there's nothing about me there's a
19:33 process here
19:35 so it's not like i'm better looking or
19:37 my voice sounds better than anyone else
19:39 there's nothing about me specific
19:41 there's a process here for anyone
19:43 listening to become
19:44 a better speaker and to become a great
19:46 speaker
19:48 yeah well maybe um let's jump into this
19:51 process so what the process is
19:54 yeah so it's um so you have this concept
19:57 of attention
19:57 so you walk out on the stage you being
20:00 the speaker
20:00 you you're given attention for free but
20:03 you can quickly lose it
20:05 so you can imagine if you or myself
20:07 we're walking out on stage
20:09 code's over we're in a walk out in front
20:10 of an audience of a thousand people or
20:12 even 100 people you all have their
20:14 attention
20:15 but they are going to quickly decide if
20:17 they're going to pull out their phones
20:18 their laptops or disengage
20:21 and so um i i like having
20:24 so there's lots of subtopics one of the
20:26 sub topics is around first impression
20:28 so how do you introduce yourself what's
20:30 the best way to introduce yourself
20:32 but getting into the meat of the talk i
20:34 think it's important to have a talk
20:36 that leverages storytelling you jump in
20:39 with vivid details you you have a story
20:41 that's engaging
20:42 because think of your audience as being
20:44 like cold taffy
20:46 you have to warm them up you can warm
20:48 them up with humor you can warm them up
20:50 with storytelling and if you can warm
20:51 them up
20:52 they're going to be much more receptive
20:54 to the key points you want to share
20:57 and and so if i had to simplify the talk
20:59 the beginning of the talk is the warm-up
21:02 and that could be storytelling it could
21:04 be something that's more creative
21:06 maybe something that's silly nonsensical
21:08 surprising
21:09 there's a lot of emotions you can play
21:11 with so i i when i would design my talks
21:14 i used to write the emotion on every
21:15 slide
21:16 that i wanted the audience to have and
21:19 the emotions could be
21:21 concern relief anxiety
21:24 happiness sadness like they could be all
21:27 all the emotions you can imagine
21:29 and by writing it down on each slide it
21:31 would allow me to amplify it or like
21:33 have like what is the goal
21:35 for the the felt audience experience and
21:38 i think of it as being a monotonic
21:39 speaker
21:40 no one wants to listen to a monotonic
21:42 speaker but in the same vein
21:45 i'm not going to warm up the audience if
21:46 i just have one emotion
21:48 so if i kind of have these whip saw and
21:50 warm them up
21:51 and the humor can be a very powerful
21:52 tool for that
21:54 then it's also really important to have
21:56 key takeaways because if i just
21:58 if i just have a talk that is
21:59 storytelling warming them up
22:02 then at the end you might say well what
22:03 was the point of this talk and you'd
22:05 have that'd be a fair criticism
22:06 what is the point of this talk like is
22:08 this a storytelling festival
22:10 like it's supposed to be a tech
22:11 conference so like you need both
22:14 and i think it's really important to
22:15 decide what is
22:17 the gift that you will give to the
22:19 audience and that probably sounds
22:21 erratic to say because it's not
22:24 like what i'm trying to say is you need
22:27 to give the audience something for free
22:29 some learned insight some key point
22:32 if they never see you again they need to
22:34 be able to leave and say thank you
22:36 thank you i that's useful for me
22:40 and so you need to identify what that is
22:42 so identify the warm-up
22:43 identify what the key takeaways are that
22:46 they can have and
22:47 it's hard because there can't be a lot
22:49 of them i i can't have
22:51 10 key takeaways like people don't
22:53 remember
22:54 because the the other thing for talk is
22:56 they need to remember it they
22:58 if i give a talk and everyone says oh
23:00 that was a great talk and then they wake
23:01 up the next morning
23:02 i forgot what the talk was about it
23:04 wasn't a great talk
23:06 that was a terrible talk so decide what
23:08 the key takeaways are
23:10 there's other tricks you can have in the
23:11 talk where you can have a call to action
23:13 you can have something at the end where
23:15 you try to engage
23:16 people to go to a certain place go watch
23:20 something or reach out to you
23:21 specifically
23:22 for further questions so sometimes
23:24 people forget the call to action
23:27 so you mentioned warm-up then
23:30 you know when you get to the middle of
23:32 the presentation you need to
23:34 use storytelling and then think which
23:36 kind of emotions you want to appeal to
23:38 right and then you really need to think
23:40 of the
23:41 key takeaway messages like and it should
23:44 be very few of them
23:45 one two three right and then at the end
23:48 there is call to action what do you want
23:49 the audience
23:50 to do right what you want them to do
23:53 after
23:53 this talk right this is the main
23:57 the main elements of the talk right yeah
24:01 yeah so how do you like i just imagine
24:03 like
24:04 let's say i go give a talk and uh you
24:07 know at the beginning i started saying
24:08 hey
24:09 i am alexi i am a leader scientist blah
24:12 blah blah and then
24:13 like is it a good way to introduce
24:14 myself like is there a better way
24:17 yeah there is a better way and there's
24:20 um there's different tiers of expertise
24:23 on how to introduce yourself
24:25 so the worst way oh
24:29 sorry my audio just switched
24:32 can you still hear me and see me i can
24:34 still hear you but not see
24:37 okay let me fix it there you go now you
24:39 can see me
24:40 yes okay i turned on my car to charge my
24:43 phone
24:44 um so the yeah there's
24:47 so the word you can introduce yourself
24:49 as just your name like i could say my
24:51 name is ben or my name is lexi
24:53 i'm going to talk to you today you
24:54 haven't given the audience
24:56 a reason what are your credentials why
24:59 should i listen
25:00 to you like are you some random homeless
25:02 person on the street like
25:03 who are you why should i listen to you
25:05 and the reason it's important
25:06 to give them a reason to listen to you
25:09 is it
25:10 you can think of just pulling the band
25:11 and storytelling like they're going to
25:13 lean in like
25:14 you get on stage should i put my phone
25:16 should i have my phone out or put it
25:17 should i listen to you if you introduce
25:19 yourselves with some credibility
25:22 then i want to listen to you so if you
25:23 say hey i have this much experience so
25:27 most people do a resume overview
25:30 like hey i worked here this is my title
25:33 this is my amount of experience i'm
25:35 going to give you this talk
25:36 and that's not terrible like that most
25:39 people do that
25:40 i've done that from a lot of my talks a
25:43 better
25:44 approach which is very difficult is
25:48 you would immediately jump into a story
25:52 where the audience concludes that you
25:54 are the hero of that story
25:56 you it's very interesting because if you
25:59 force conclusions for the audience it
26:01 weakens
26:02 the point so imagine if i
26:05 jump into a hero story like we're right
26:09 there in the action i'm talking about
26:11 an ai problem i was solving or some
26:13 impossible problem that i'm up against
26:16 and then if at the end of that if i say
26:19 and therefore i'm a great data scientist
26:21 like what just happened to your
26:22 confidence just like it just like
26:24 now i'm actually crossing the line into
26:26 arrogance but i tell a hero story
26:29 where there's chaos there's an
26:31 opportunity to fail
26:33 and then there's success that can
26:36 actually what i've done is i've taken
26:39 you on an emotional journey
26:41 because if i just do a cv overview
26:42 that's a that's a rational argument
26:45 but the the fun thing is if you win on
26:48 the emotional journey
26:50 if i tell you anything else it just
26:52 confirms your first impression so
26:54 if i tell you i was the chief data
26:57 scientist at this company or if i tell
26:59 you
26:59 that i did a startup like it just
27:01 confirms the first impression but if i
27:02 try to start with a rational approach
27:05 i actually won't be able to fill to that
27:09 i'll only be able to feel to the line of
27:11 if i'm lucky i'll get to smart
27:13 but the other approach you can actually
27:14 exceed smart
27:16 if you exceed smart you land in hero
27:19 territory
27:20 if you're in hero territory then the
27:22 perceptions are very very different
27:24 then you're perceived as being in the
27:25 top 1 which is interesting because
27:28 you're not being dishonest and you're
27:30 not lying and you're not
27:32 you're not trying to pull the wool over
27:33 people's eyes but you're entertaining
27:35 them
27:36 with the story and the last point
27:38 allowed is the hero's journey
27:40 is the story that's been told for
27:41 thousands of years through
27:43 all of society and if you look at these
27:45 disney cartoons or pixar cartoons
27:47 there a lot of them are templated after
27:50 the hero's journey
27:51 and it's almost like there's something
27:53 in our dna
27:54 where humans will celebrate any hero
27:58 that has some element of risk and it
28:02 usually comes back to them achieving
28:03 some value not just for them but for
28:05 society
28:07 like we benefit from a hero if you're a
28:10 hero i benefit
28:11 vice versa yeah that's a pretty high bar
28:14 so i'm wondering maybe if you
28:16 have like a 30 second example just to
28:19 understand
28:20 how it might look like
28:23 you remind me it's it is a high bar and
28:26 it's something that i don't expect
28:27 people to do
28:28 well there's an important alternative
28:32 that you can do
28:33 and that is having someone else
28:34 introduce you so a lot of times you'll
28:36 have a chair at a conference that'll
28:38 introduce you but i would say they do it
28:39 they don't do it well
28:41 because they're reading your bio so i
28:43 imagine me like i look at your bio and
28:45 i'm blah blah blah like i'm or you're
28:46 doing it for me just reading the bio
28:49 that doesn't feel authentic there's no
28:50 emotion to it but if i read your bio
28:53 through the lan storytelling labs and i
28:56 say
28:57 i am so excited about the next speaker
28:59 and we've probably like heard this
29:00 before the conference
29:02 but it really isn't something that
29:03 should be laughed at like if i say
29:05 i am so excited about this next speaker
29:07 alexi he is
29:08 one of the best you know go down the
29:10 list
29:12 um it changes everything because
29:15 i i could actually get you into hero
29:17 territory just with my introduction
29:19 of you but if you introduce yourself or
29:22 if i introduce myself we can't get that
29:24 high so
29:24 to go back to your question to tell the
29:26 hero's journey
29:27 i might pick an ai project in the last
29:30 six months
29:31 or 12 months where i've nearly failed
29:35 and i might just dive into the story
29:38 and and really it's about maximizing
29:41 attention so
29:42 for most the people in our industry
29:44 they're very technical
29:46 a lot of them tend to be more
29:48 introverted they're not going to dance
29:50 on stage or sing
29:51 and so mastering these storytelling
29:53 techniques is not something
29:55 that most of them feel comfortable with
29:57 but i but i want to kind of
29:59 plead with the audience that if you do
30:02 if you master these techniques
30:04 it's game-changing it's it can be
30:07 life-changing
30:08 you can you you can make an audience cry
30:13 talking about ai which is like the the
30:14 craziest thing like if i told you like
30:16 hey
30:17 give me a hundred dollars if you can go
30:19 find someone in the front row that
30:20 dropped and i'm not saying like i've
30:22 succeeded at doing this but i'm saying
30:23 it is possible
30:25 you you could go and give a keynote and
30:27 find
30:28 someone who who you've been able to
30:32 push past that emotional barrier in a
30:34 way that feels authentic where it feels
30:36 like
30:37 a lot of times we talk about the
30:38 technical gift like the factoids
30:41 but i would also offer with a really
30:42 good talk there's an emotional gift
30:45 you've given them a perspective or a
30:47 point of view or an experience
30:50 that they're grateful for and they'll
30:52 remember how they felt
30:54 during that experience okay well this
30:57 sounds
30:58 almost impossible for somebody like me
31:00 who is like a technical person
31:02 so i'm i'm a data scientist i'm used to
31:05 uh you know just uh
31:09 using facts and then uh like i
31:12 i think okay i am a data person then i
31:14 like data so i will
31:16 just show a lot of data to others and
31:18 they will like this data and they will
31:20 get convinced
31:21 so how somebody technical like me or
31:25 let's say like probably like a developer
31:27 data scientist uh
31:29 some other engineer like the technical
31:31 person how can they
31:33 go from this uh from this uh
31:37 flag based uh you know presentation to
31:40 something like to story based like
31:42 how do we craft this story yeah that
31:45 yeah that's a great question so i i
31:47 would say
31:48 that leaning too much on the data can
31:50 handicap you
31:51 it actually hurts your because i the
31:54 standard data science presentations that
31:55 i walk through
31:56 will be they're talking about one
31:58 project they did
32:00 but they're going to have 10 or 15
32:01 slides that go through their approach
32:04 and the approach is not useful like if
32:06 i'm an executive
32:07 like if i'm a data scientist i'm going
32:08 to critique you fine
32:10 like i can go through the approach so i
32:13 like to tease
32:14 data scientists that do this style of
32:16 presentation
32:17 by saying they're fishing for partial
32:19 credit or they're trying to remind you
32:21 that they're smart
32:22 and and i'm not criticizing i'm actually
32:24 criticizing myself so if i go back six
32:26 or seven years i remember giving some
32:28 presentations to higher view executives
32:30 where during the presentation the ceo
32:32 would interrupt me and say
32:34 ben we know you're smart that's why we
32:37 hired you
32:38 you don't have to keep reminding us and
32:40 that's not a compliment
32:42 that what that's telling you is i'm not
32:45 communicating executives they've got so
32:48 much bandwidth i'm not communicating so
32:50 so sometimes going through the data can
32:53 actually
32:53 hurt your ability to communicate like
32:57 you still want to have some data and
32:58 rational
32:58 um conclusion so i think for people
33:00 listening
33:02 storytelling is not just about giving a
33:04 presentation storytelling can be used
33:07 at a strategic dinner you're with you
33:10 know potential customers with customers
33:12 with prospects you're at a conference
33:15 networking with people
33:17 your ability to tell stories can impact
33:19 you on the personal level it can impact
33:21 you as a speaker
33:22 it's it's a very important skill set and
33:24 so i've become a fan
33:26 of for people that's saying that are
33:28 parents some you're a parent i'm a
33:29 parent
33:30 um our kids want us to street stories at
33:32 night
33:33 and you can read stories at night but i
33:36 would encourage you to tell stories
33:38 at night so you and i like we've been on
33:40 this earth for a while we've
33:41 we've made some mistakes we've been dumb
33:43 kids before
33:45 and so i noticed that me telling my kids
33:47 stories at night
33:48 they love my stories way more than they
33:51 love reading a book
33:52 like some book about a hen or some
33:55 chicken or
33:56 something that does something me telling
33:58 and so
33:59 one of the things i'd encourage people
34:00 to do is tell your kids stories
34:03 at night about you or about
34:06 things you've done and try to practice
34:08 some of these storytelling tricks and
34:10 see if you can captivate their attention
34:12 so if you tell a story at night and if
34:13 your kids are not asking you to tell
34:15 another one
34:16 you've got work to do but if you begin
34:18 to become a better storyteller
34:20 where every night your kids are begging
34:21 you for the second story or tell another
34:23 story please
34:25 you're making progress and that might
34:27 sound very silly
34:29 that you practicing telling your kids
34:30 stories at night is going to make you a
34:32 better speaker
34:34 but it's true you will be if you and you
34:37 can also read books there's stories that
34:38 stick there's the heroes ten thousand
34:40 faces there's
34:42 that one last point i'll point out
34:45 i i love that this feels very childish
34:47 it feels like storytelling like
34:49 hopefully people in data science are
34:50 rolling their eyes like
34:52 i'm grown up i don't have time for
34:53 storytelling but pixar
34:56 how much money do they make with these
34:58 movies like pixar makes hundreds of
35:00 millions of dollars with these movies
35:03 this isn't a guess it's not a game this
35:06 is a this is a science
35:08 when pixar comes out with a new movie
35:10 they're going to
35:11 invest hundreds of millions of dollars
35:12 sometimes in this production
35:15 this movie better work it better
35:18 get that type of return and so if you
35:20 look at it that way
35:21 if you're a data scientist working for
35:23 pixar or disney these movies are going
35:25 to make money and storytelling works
35:27 it's a science
35:28 it's not it's not some shaman or some
35:32 goofy person saying you know get on
35:34 stage and tell a story it's
35:35 there's real business attached to this
35:38 significant business and
35:39 and so it's not it's an opportunity for
35:41 anyone in tech
35:42 to um yeah
35:46 to learn from it leverage it use it
35:47 because it in the end you're trying to
35:50 maximize the tension of your audience
35:53 because because the saddest thing is
35:54 what if you get to your key point we
35:55 talk about two
35:56 two three points you want to share with
35:57 the audience what if you get to your key
35:59 point at the end to share
36:01 and half of them are on their phones
36:03 half them are checked out
36:05 even the ones that think they're
36:06 listening they're not actually listening
36:08 they're like daydreaming they're they're
36:11 giving you like 30
36:12 of their focus then that's too bad
36:15 that's sad like you actually had a key
36:17 insight to share
36:18 but the the catalyst to transfer that
36:21 was
36:22 dull or dead and you probably listened
36:25 you go to a data conference how many
36:27 how many talks are forgettable like most
36:29 of them
36:30 most of them is like and it's not an
36:32 insult it's just true
36:33 most of them most of the talks are
36:35 forgettable how many of those people
36:37 were smart
36:38 most of them yes most of them are very
36:40 smart all of them like all of them
36:42 they're very smart they're very
36:42 accomplished
36:43 unfortunately most of the talks were
36:45 forgettable so
36:47 the challenge for everyone listening is
36:49 make sure your talk
36:50 so so i think you mentioned impossible a
36:53 few times and i actually like that
36:54 because i like having impossible goals
36:57 so when i go to give a talk there's a
36:59 lot of little talks that you just kind
37:01 of have to give you don't have a lot of
37:02 prep to do
37:03 but for the big talks the big keynotes
37:05 the most important talks that you're
37:07 looking forward to
37:08 my goal with those talks is when i give
37:10 the talk
37:11 i want it to be the best talk i've ever
37:13 given in my life
37:15 and that's that's not always possible
37:17 that's an impossible goal
37:18 but sometimes it happens i also want the
37:21 talk to be remembered for five years
37:23 what i mean by that is if you attend the
37:26 talk
37:27 if i never see you again but if i run
37:29 into you somewhere
37:30 traveling five years later you can say i
37:32 remember your talk
37:34 at that conference and then the the
37:37 third part would be if there is audience
37:38 feedback i want to be the number one
37:40 speaker
37:41 for the entire conference from audience
37:43 feedback
37:44 not from speaker feedback not from
37:45 conference organizers feedback from the
37:47 audience feedback i want to be the
37:48 number one best speaker and those three
37:52 i've accomplished all three of them
37:54 individually at different times like
37:56 i've had conferences where i've been the
37:57 best speaker i've had talks where people
37:58 have remembered it
37:59 for five years or longer but to have the
38:02 goal to accomplish all of them
38:04 and i've had talks that have been i've
38:06 obviously have one talk somewhere that
38:07 was my best talk ever
38:09 for someone but like for me i mean for
38:12 for i have a best ben taylor talk i
38:14 don't know what that talk is
38:16 but to have that as a goal as you're
38:17 getting ready to go into these keynotes
38:20 it's an impossible goal but i think it's
38:21 a goal that everyone can have
38:23 you're going to go give an important
38:24 talk in the next six months but for
38:26 people starting out that could just be a
38:27 local meetup
38:28 they've never given a talk before
38:30 they're going to present a local meetup
38:31 so
38:32 obsess about it try to make this the
38:35 best talk you've ever given
38:36 try to make sure you can do something so
38:39 this talk will be remembered for five
38:40 years
38:41 if there is audience feedback and
38:42 there's other speakers competing against
38:44 you
38:44 try to be the best talk and if you're
38:48 and i'm not the best talk all the time
38:49 so you can learn like i'm sure i've been
38:51 the worst
38:51 like bottom bottom tier on some
38:54 conferences
38:55 you can learn from it going back to the
38:58 question i asked
38:59 so like uh what was that ah so how you
39:03 um um like you you
39:06 told the like to become so you you told
39:10 us a story like
39:11 that some executive at some point told
39:13 you that haben we didn't hire you to be
39:16 we know you're smart but here like you
39:18 need to you know make it uh digestible
39:21 for us
39:21 so how did you go from uh
39:25 ben taylor back then you know speaking
39:27 in front of uh
39:28 executives and not being able to to
39:31 communicate to them to
39:32 ben taylor now who gives talks that
39:35 uh that they remembered for you know for
39:38 five years for
39:39 being in stories or
39:42 like is there something else like people
39:45 can do to
39:46 um you know to to come from
39:50 uh from that state to the state where
39:52 you are now
39:54 or just i think that's tough because a
39:56 lot of it just comes down to experience
39:58 so even that example i gave
40:00 when he said that i was confused like
40:03 and i don't think i had a follow-up
40:05 action like i i
40:06 probably didn't learn from it for a
40:08 couple years and it wasn't until
40:10 maybe it wasn't even until i went and
40:12 did my own startup that i finally
40:14 because one of the things i was doing i
40:15 would try to spoon feed or teach
40:18 the executive statistical facts
40:21 like hey i want i want you to understand
40:24 why
40:25 an auc chart is so nice i want you to
40:27 understand
40:28 what i had to do because your data was
40:30 so dirty i want you to appreciate and i
40:33 saw it as like if i give you enough of
40:34 these little factoids
40:36 we will you're going to fall in love
40:38 with it just because i
40:39 i'm in love with this stuff you're going
40:41 to fall in love with it and it'll be
40:42 we'll all be better off
40:44 and that was a very naive perspective
40:47 because what i didn't know is the ceo is
40:50 living on a plane
40:53 you know trying to save these accounts
40:54 like very large million dollar accounts
40:56 that could be churned or lost
40:58 and he's constantly up against these
41:00 quarters and arguing with
41:02 board members and you know firing and
41:04 hiring
41:05 and so when it comes to mental bandwidth
41:08 he has no mental bandwidth and so so i
41:11 didn't know that now and so
41:13 there is an experience thing you just
41:14 have to make hopefully you can learn
41:16 from other people's
41:17 failures like try to follow people and
41:18 learn from people that are
41:20 like for anyone that's put machine
41:22 learning in production they've screwed
41:23 up
41:24 at some point they've had something go
41:26 wrong a model didn't generalize there
41:27 was feature drift
41:29 version control they went to retrain the
41:31 model and the original training set was
41:32 gone it was deleted or
41:34 like they've had they've made mistakes
41:35 so you can learn from other people
41:37 like try to follow people that have made
41:39 these mistakes but
41:41 um yeah it's i wish i could have learned
41:44 these lessons sooner
41:47 but part of it's just kind of being hit
41:48 over the head
41:50 enough but i guess the last thing is
41:53 seeing seeing the world through other
41:55 people's
41:56 shoes or from their perspective is
41:58 useful so in the moment if i if i had
42:01 actually really understood
42:02 the horrors and the stress that a ceo
42:04 deals with
42:06 my talks would have been very different
42:08 or if i
42:09 if i knew how much anxiety my amazon
42:11 built was causing them
42:13 because from my perspective it's like oh
42:14 it's the cost of research like
42:16 grow up you know it's going to cost you
42:18 thousands of dollars per month in amazon
42:20 burn
42:20 if you don't like it apparently you're
42:23 not ready for ai
42:24 or like that's it's way more emotional
42:29 so like for them it's it's very
42:31 upsetting
42:32 and and the thing they don't so this is
42:35 the thing i love
42:36 is these are all the things the ceo was
42:39 thinking about you but they didn't say
42:42 and hopefully if people realize this it
42:44 will scare them into doing the right
42:45 thing
42:45 so as a ceo so now ben taylor's turning
42:49 into i'm not a ceo but now i'm turning
42:50 into a ceo for a second
42:52 then taylor's the ceo you sit down and
42:55 you're gonna
42:55 present for 30 minutes or an hour let's
42:57 say you schedule an hour with me
42:59 the more you make me understand the data
43:02 and the steps you took
43:03 to get to success the more i want to
43:05 fire you
43:07 and
43:10 because i'm because i'm confused you're
43:12 wasting my time
43:14 i don't get the point of this what's the
43:16 recommendation
43:18 and if we could have a 30-minute meeting
43:20 where you say
43:21 these are the final results this is the
43:23 team that did it
43:25 these are potential concerns these are
43:27 potential pros
43:28 this is my recommendation to you because
43:30 a lot of times in the data science team
43:31 we show them
43:32 all of this work they're trying to
43:34 understand it they're confused by it
43:37 and we see it as validation that we're
43:38 smart validation that we're working hard
43:40 for them
43:41 but then at the end a decision has to be
43:43 made
43:44 is this model ready to go in production
43:46 what are next steps
43:48 and a lot of times we rely on the ceo to
43:49 make that decision
43:51 but they hired you to make that decision
43:53 like you can
43:54 it's better for you to give a
43:55 recommendation and for them to disagree
43:58 with it
43:59 or for them to challenge it be like you
44:02 know imagine like me saying i recommend
44:04 that this model is ready to go in
44:06 production and we should sell it or
44:08 like we should sell it to the customer
44:10 now there's an opportunity to say
44:12 i don't trust you great let's talk about
44:14 it so like
44:15 that's the saddest part is that meeting
44:17 we just talked about 60 minutes
44:18 was wasted going through data instead we
44:22 should have spent 60 minutes talking
44:24 about
44:24 i don't trust you oh you don't why let's
44:27 talk about it
44:28 why don't you trust me how do i know
44:31 like that's a much more productive
44:32 conversation
44:34 because the first scenario ceo is
44:37 confused
44:38 no real actions came out of the meeting
44:40 they're wondering
44:41 when you're going to be productive
44:43 they're wondering if they should fire
44:45 you they're wondering if they made a
44:46 mistake
44:47 they don't know if this is a good idea
44:48 they know they need to invest in ai
44:49 because they're supposed to
44:51 there's just a lot of terrible things
44:52 they think after that other meeting
44:54 this meeting is radical candor
44:57 candor right to the point your
45:00 recommendation
45:01 no confusion no jargon like
45:05 yeah i've been this data scientist i've
45:08 been the first one i've been the bad one
45:09 but i'd say
45:10 most data scientists fall into the bad
45:11 category very technical
45:13 they can communicate with each other
45:14 they can't communicate well with an
45:16 executive
45:17 where now in my career i would love i
45:20 love talking to executives because
45:22 they're so focused on value
45:23 focused on growth and and you can talk
45:26 to an executive and not use a single
45:28 word of data science jargon
45:32 yeah so it's how do you learn it you
45:35 just go through the meat grinder
45:37 okay so i've heard about this pyramid
45:42 principle like when you start from the
45:44 you know from the final from the
45:46 recommendation and if need be you you
45:48 know
45:48 you kind of go down deeper in the
45:51 technical
45:52 implementation and whatnot but you start
45:54 with the
45:55 results and then if needed you go down
45:58 you should you should have an appendix
46:00 so if a ceo says did you guys try
46:02 anything else you say yes absolutely
46:04 jump to the appendix um
46:07 the thing that is very top of mind for
46:09 me now is this idea of time efficiency
46:12 like if i could scream at the top of my
46:15 lungs time efficiency
46:16 so for an executive time efficiency is
46:18 everything get to the point
46:20 tell them what they need to know do they
46:23 like uh because the thing i i'm
46:25 realizing now like
46:28 if you are having a conversation and if
46:30 the ceo of the company
46:32 is not mission critical like we're
46:34 talking minutes
46:35 like within minutes if they're not
46:37 critical for this conversation
46:39 they should leave the meeting that's
46:41 true and i know elon does this like
46:43 he'll just
46:44 if he realizes he's not needed for this
46:46 meeting he just leaves and he does that
46:48 all the time and like that's
46:50 and i think most ceos should do that
46:52 most ceos
46:54 should be rude and and i i don't
46:58 let me rephrase that so most ceos
47:00 shouldn't be worried
47:02 about your feelings they should do
47:04 what's prudent they should do what's
47:06 useful they should make the best use of
47:07 their time
47:08 and even if you're a very senior person
47:10 in the company if i'm the ceo if i walk
47:12 into the meeting
47:14 and within a few minutes i realized that
47:16 you don't need me or
47:17 this is not productive i might be kind
47:19 enough to say be like hey
47:21 i don't get the sense i'm needed i'm
47:22 going to leave this meeting which is
47:24 really like hey you screwed up
47:26 you have an opportunity to save it or
47:27 tell me why i should be here and if you
47:29 don't have a good argument then i'm
47:30 leaving
47:31 most ceos should act like that because
47:35 their time is so valuable yes so we
47:38 talked a bit about
47:39 you know talking to executives um how
47:42 about uh
47:43 giving talks at the conference so you
47:44 said you should
47:46 of course saying hi like set the bar
47:49 high uh
47:51 you know give big talks uh be
47:54 try to be remembered for five years
47:59 and yeah so i have a few uh
48:02 questions here so first is like first
48:05 how do you get to a conference so to get
48:07 it to a conference you need to
48:09 um to send a talk proposal right so how
48:12 do you
48:13 structure this talk proposal how do you
48:15 write it in a way that
48:16 uh you know you get to the conference
48:18 you get to speak because
48:20 sometimes uh the committee rejects your
48:23 talk proposals right
48:24 so yeah it can happen to some on some
48:27 consequences it's
48:28 hard to speak right so you need to write
48:31 a good proposal so do you have any
48:33 suggestions like how how should they
48:35 approach that like how should they write
48:37 my
48:38 proposal yeah that's a great question
48:41 um so for people that are starting out
48:42 their speaking career you
48:44 it's easier for you to go land a local
48:46 meetup because you might be able to
48:47 actually meet the meetup organizer and
48:49 sometimes
48:50 they're always looking for interesting
48:51 talks so if you can work with a local
48:52 meetup organizer
48:53 get a talk there and actually get a
48:55 recording something on youtube that'll
48:56 give you something you can share
48:58 so then you have a talk of yourself and
49:00 you can even imagine a scenario where
49:02 you could give a talk to no one like hey
49:05 everyone listening this weekend
49:07 you'd organize a talk you could go
49:09 record a talk post it to youtube you
49:10 could share that link
49:12 trying to pitch yourself into a meetup
49:13 or pitching yourself into a conference
49:15 that way they know
49:16 that you you know you can give a talk
49:19 it's not gonna be terrible
49:20 i do like to understand the conference
49:22 organizers priorities
49:24 they have different priorities so you
49:26 doing like bag of words nlp
49:29 they might be like oh my gosh like no
49:31 thank you
49:32 like we've already had that before but
49:33 if you do doing a talk around reinforced
49:35 learning or
49:36 or bert or like something so definitely
49:38 understand
49:39 the conference organizers need sometimes
49:41 i'll tease out a few topics
49:43 i might give them two or three topics um
49:47 it's also important to understand who
49:49 the conference organizers are
49:51 because they're really the decision
49:52 makers the conference is their baby the
49:54 conference has to be good
49:57 and conferences really it's almost like
49:59 your resume
50:00 so we have a work resume i worked at
50:02 this company i did this project
50:04 in a way you have a speaker resume that
50:06 i went to this conference
50:08 here's the talk i went to this other
50:10 conference and you can kind of level
50:12 up from being a speaker to like a
50:13 featured speaker to a keynote speaker
50:15 in different conferences and that's
50:18 super useful
50:19 um the one thought i had
50:23 is you need to fight sameness so you
50:26 need to run away from sameness
50:27 because humans are novelty seeking
50:30 creatures remember things that are
50:31 unique
50:32 you know if we walk through the forest
50:33 we're going to forget everything except
50:35 the bright red mushroom or like
50:37 or the the new animal that we saw like
50:39 we've never seen a rabbit before we saw
50:40 the rabbit
50:41 we remember that rabbit forever like i
50:44 think humans are so funny that way so
50:46 when you submit your your idea try to be
50:48 creative try to have
50:50 a project that the other thing i'll tell
50:54 to your audience you can actually scare
50:57 yourself with the proposal
50:58 so what i mean by that so i've talked
51:00 about reckless commitment
51:01 so imagine if you're you're a conference
51:04 organizer
51:05 and i'm saying i'm going to give a talk
51:08 on this
51:09 and this is some ambitious topic this is
51:11 something that i'm not
51:12 qualified to give a talk on but if
51:15 you're the conference organ
51:17 organizer if you bite at this then oh
51:20  now i've got
51:22 three months to like bust myself
51:25 to make that happen and so that's
51:27 something i would encourage people to do
51:28 is
51:29 the the joke is if you land yourself on
51:32 the schedule to give a talk on any topic
51:34 that's months away you will be an expert
51:37 by the time that talk comes you might
51:39 cry at night you might
51:41 lose sleep over it you might read a lot
51:43 of books
51:44 but by the time you give that talk
51:46 because i think there's also this
51:48 concept of imposter syndrome and i think
51:50 that can shut people down
51:52 where it's funny because i remember
51:54 giving a few talks
51:55 i gave talk to san francisco once and
51:57 there's someone on the front row that
51:59 was asking
52:00 some question about like different norms
52:03 on my cost function or something and
52:06 and i think sometimes as a speaker that
52:08 that can shut you down
52:09 or you're like is it it's i like telling
52:12 for people listening i like just saying
52:15 guaranteed there's someone in the
52:16 audience smarter than you
52:17 so don't don't try to be the smartest
52:19 person in the room because that can
52:20 backfire so during
52:22 q a if someone asks you a question if
52:25 you don't know the answer
52:26 if you think the question is kind of
52:27 embarrassing the temptation is to try to
52:30 answer it
52:31 that's really bad don't try to answer a
52:33 question you don't know the answer to
52:35 so if i if i ask you a technical
52:37 question there's a good chance that the
52:38 technical question is so technical you
52:40 don't know the answer
52:41 it's actually not a lot of value to the
52:43 audience it's it's literally me
52:46 sometimes you get people in an audience
52:47 where i want to prove that i'm the
52:48 smartest person in the room you give the
52:50 talk
52:50 i i'm on the front row and i raise my
52:52 hand i'm asking you a very technical
52:54 question
52:55 you don't know the answer to it it's not
52:57 a valuable question
52:59 no one in the audience cares about this
53:00 question it's just me being a juror
53:03 because i want i was invited to speak
53:04 but i want people to know i'm important
53:07 and so i've so that's something that's
53:09 interesting to get over is
53:11 you're never going to be the smartest
53:12 person in the room so just give up and
53:14 if you ask a smart question if i don't
53:15 know the answer to it i can say oh
53:17 does anyone else in the audience know
53:18 the answer or oh let's talk about this
53:20 after
53:21 i i'd love to hear your perspective and
53:24 then go on to the next question where
53:25 you actually can't answer it so
53:28 yeah start speaking get past the parts
53:31 where you feel intimidated
53:32 everyone's gonna be nervous at the
53:35 beginning q a can be terrifying but not
53:37 if you decide that there are smarter
53:40 people in the audience and you decide
53:42 that you won't pretend to answer a
53:44 question you can't
53:46 and it's okay and i think you also
53:49 mentioned
53:50 that you shouldn't aim straight away to
53:53 i don't know keynote at strata or
53:55 something like
53:56 high profile it's okay to start with
53:58 local meetups like
53:59 uh and then gradually build your
54:01 portfolio build your
54:03 like speaker cd and then and then this
54:06 is how you get from the conferences by
54:08 speaking first on local meetups and this
54:10 is how you get
54:11 on strata by first speaking on local
54:13 conferences right
54:14 this is how you get on uh keynote uh
54:19 by speaking at uh you know conferences
54:22 this is right right yeah
54:24 that is right and i'd also say you pre
54:26 nobody could probably land a keynote
54:28 at these victor conferences because you
54:30 need to have a track record you need to
54:31 have
54:32 a personal brand or or maybe an employer
54:36 like a lot of times for those keynotes
54:38 the keynote has to be a draw for the
54:40 conference
54:41 and so the keynote might be a specific
54:44 brand an individual who's built up a
54:46 name for themselves or a company
54:48 they really want some director from this
54:51 particular company
54:52 but you don't have to work at google or
54:54 facebook or these bigger companies to
54:56 land a keynote you
54:57 you can land keynotes by working for a
55:00 very small company if you've built up
55:02 a reputation because they they want the
55:05 talk to be good
55:07 if you've proven that you can be a good
55:08 speaker and if you're gaining momentum
55:10 then
55:11 you can begin landing feature talks and
55:14 keynotes and
55:16 um yeah so just asking to be a keynote
55:19 speaker
55:20 the default answer will be no until
55:23 someone builds up the brand until they
55:25 get this track record or until they have
55:27 this role
55:28 where they can do that but they you've
55:31 probably seen keynote speakers too where
55:32 they're awful
55:33 they're bad and that's because they're
55:35 being pulled in because of the bra
55:37 because of a company brand like oh
55:39 so-and-so at
55:40 google or at this company is going to be
55:42 slotted in
55:43 if they're not a good keynote speaker
55:45 then the decision was made because the
55:47 company brand or
55:48 it could be a sponsored talk sometimes
55:50 those keynote talks are actually paid
55:52 for by the company that's giving the
55:53 talk
55:55 so roll the dice on if it's good to be
55:58 here
55:59 do you have a bit more time because we
56:02 work we kind of should be wrapping up
56:04 but we have questions from the audience
56:06 maybe we can
56:07 good let me let me check my calendar
56:10 i think if i scroll up my video will i
56:13 won't drop
56:14 me yeah if you're okay i'll just check
56:16 my calendar
56:17 um let's see okay
56:22 calendar oh i'm actually free
56:26 so yeah i'm free for 30 minutes well we
56:28 will not
56:29 need that much maybe five to ten minutes
56:32 um okay so should i start or you you
56:35 need to
56:35 yeah yeah okay yeah there we are um
56:39 so as a new data science professional
56:41 what topics
56:42 and groups would be good to start with
56:45 i'm not a deep learning expert but i
56:47 understand business and data this is
56:48 something eric's
56:50 eric was asking um
56:54 so you i feel like everything in life
56:57 falls into a levy distribution so it's
56:59 like the normal distribution with the
57:00 long tail so
57:02 most of data science falls in this
57:03 normal distribution of
57:05 usefulness so think of like pandas data
57:08 frames
57:09 bayesian methods building models like
57:11 sklearn data frames
57:13 just a python foundation docker it's all
57:16 useful
57:16 all of this is great on the long tail
57:18 you've got deep learning
57:20 reinforced learning these things that
57:21 are very sexy they're very exciting so a
57:23 lot of people getting into data science
57:25 they say
57:26 i want to have deep learning do video
57:28 games i want to like do this
57:30 but a lot of the jobs and a lot of the
57:32 value and the work to be done is not
57:34 that
57:34 like you will find use cases but they're
57:36 quite rare so i think to start out um
57:41 the the dream scenario is
57:44 ai a lot of times ai moves the wrong
57:46 direction it's ai looking for a problem
57:49 to solve and that's dangerous because
57:52 not as you find the wrong problem
57:53 where it's much more powerful if you
57:55 have a problem
57:56 that's being backed into the right tool
57:58 set so for people starting out
58:00 whether you're currently employed try to
58:03 find a business problem that's
58:05 big it's important it matters you you
58:09 know if you can automate it or augment
58:10 it or get some insight here it'll
58:12 impact the company and then try to back
58:14 into the appropriate
58:16 solutions um and there's a good chance
58:19 deep learning is not the appropriate
58:20 solution for
58:22 you know customer churn or click-through
58:23 rate or some you know
58:25 some something related to the business
58:27 that matters it could
58:28 be something that's handled with just
58:30 structured data and you've got options
58:32 for that that
58:33 are very easy and one of the things i
58:34 like to bring up is
58:36 everything used to be hard 10 years ago
58:38 everything was hard
58:40 today a lot of this stuff is very easy
58:42 so if you have a structured data set you
58:43 want to build
58:45 something this this isn't a research
58:48 project that should take months
58:49 this is googling or using pre-built
58:52 software
58:53 or these solutions should be very easy
58:56 to do so
58:57 yeah start there find the problems first
59:00 back them into the right solutions
59:01 leverage the data science community to
59:03 help you go to data science meetups
59:05 you'll be very impressed with
59:08 you have two different worlds between
59:10 academia
59:11 so coming right out of school and then
59:13 the applied meetup space
59:15 there's a lot of behaviors and skills
59:16 over here that donut do not exist over
59:19 here
59:20 so definitely try to become injected
59:21 into the applied meetup space
59:23 and you'll find peers that can help you
59:26 there's a
59:27 much longer answer to a short question
59:29 but yeah great question
59:31 yes and then also eric is asking and i
59:34 think
59:35 this is a follow-up question to the
59:37 previous one is like
59:38 how would you pitch to speak at an event
59:41 like a meetup i think we briefly
59:42 covered that but let's say using the
59:45 same scenario like
59:46 uh you just take something relatively
59:49 straightforward business problem you use
59:52 um
59:53 you use like tools like psychic learn to
59:55 solve this problem so
59:57 you have this solution right so how do
59:59 you pitch
1:00:00 to speak to meet up organizers to talk
1:00:03 about this solution
1:00:05 yeah that's yeah that's a great um
1:00:08 it kind of comes back to first
1:00:10 impressions and introductions because
1:00:12 one of my favorite stories uh rico went
1:00:15 to data science go
1:00:17 in 2017 he loved the conference and at
1:00:20 the end of the conference this is a
1:00:21 young kid i think he was 20.
1:00:23 at the end of the conference he walks up
1:00:25 to the conference organizer and says
1:00:26 i'm going to present here next year and
1:00:28 the conference organizer in his head is
1:00:30 thinking
1:00:33 no that's like like you're some
1:00:37 you know beginner new junior data
1:00:39 scientist and you think you're going to
1:00:40 present here
1:00:42 but it the kid was able to the kid
1:00:44 wasn't able to on that short
1:00:45 conversation but the kid ended up doing
1:00:47 a lot so the kid
1:00:49 went out there started to meet up did
1:00:51 all these things where the organizer
1:00:54 kept track on this kid and thought holy
1:00:56 crap like
1:00:57 this kid is out of control in a good way
1:01:00 and so the kid ended up presenting the
1:01:01 next year and gave
1:01:03 a great talk um so first impression
1:01:06 matters so who are you
1:01:07 what company do you work at um
1:01:10 you don't need to have that to back your
1:01:12 reputation you can also get endorsements
1:01:15 so imagine if like you and i know
1:01:17 someone in the community
1:01:18 and we and they we endorse them we say
1:01:21 like oh this person's really
1:01:22 good they're up and coming you you
1:01:24 should definitely give a
1:01:25 actually i had a neighbor of mine young
1:01:28 kid
1:01:29 in college wasn't he was just doing
1:01:31 research in college and he presented a
1:01:32 local meetup
1:01:34 and i i recommended that he should so
1:01:37 like
1:01:37 i've been i presented and i kind of
1:01:40 pitched his idea so
1:01:41 you can leverage other people networking
1:01:43 is so important they don't teach you
1:01:45 that in college
1:01:46 but networking is so important the
1:01:48 people you know
1:01:50 can really help get you that first talk
1:01:53 um
1:01:53 especially if they trust it's funny
1:01:55 because i'm sometimes we get
1:01:57 people asking for recommendations where
1:01:58 we don't actually know them
1:02:00 and that doesn't really work like we but
1:02:02 if we if we know someone if you can meet
1:02:04 someone you're more likely to
1:02:06 you know to kind of take some risk and
1:02:08 say hey i think this person would be
1:02:10 good
1:02:11 you should have them present that that
1:02:12 can go a long way
1:02:14 okay thank you um so
1:02:18 in your opinion mate is asking what is
1:02:21 the top
1:02:23 public speaking skill that people should
1:02:26 should reach for
1:02:30 storytelling is a big umbrella so i i
1:02:33 hate to just say storytelling
1:02:35 but if you become the biggest thing they
1:02:38 should reach for is storytelling so if
1:02:39 you
1:02:41 and maybe to kind of slant that a
1:02:43 different way it's
1:02:45 you should have a goal to maximize
1:02:46 attention and
1:02:48 in um in data science we're used to this
1:02:51 we're like oh yeah
1:02:52 optimizers you know convex problems
1:02:55 non-convex like we like
1:02:56 optimizing so treat this like a data
1:02:59 science problem you should
1:03:00 maximize the attention of your audience
1:03:04 and not just one person
1:03:07 the average attention the audience you
1:03:08 should maximize it and so that that's
1:03:10 the number one skill you
1:03:11 you can you should have and there's a
1:03:13 good chance that's gonna back into
1:03:14 storytelling
1:03:16 where it's
1:03:19 it's hard to do but it's not an
1:03:21 impossible problem it's it's a
1:03:22 predictable problem i
1:03:24 if you gave me two recorded talks this
1:03:26 person this person and
1:03:27 those stocks are gonna be streamed like
1:03:29 they're live i'm pretty sure i could
1:03:30 tell you ahead of time which talk will
1:03:32 do better
1:03:33 like it's not yeah so maximize attention
1:03:36 of your audience
1:03:38 for the entire talk okay
1:03:42 okay yeah there is more so much more we
1:03:44 can talk about this like how to get
1:03:46 uh how to do this but uh yeah let's do
1:03:49 one more question
1:03:50 again from matthew uh i know you can
1:03:54 give a long answer to this question but
1:03:56 uh
1:03:56 maybe you can keep showing it yeah so
1:03:59 how does
1:03:59 someone get started in ai eventually if
1:04:02 it's
1:04:02 of course possible to give a short
1:04:04 answer to that question
1:04:07 um i think having a speaking track
1:04:10 record can be very useful uh
1:04:12 we actually just hired a new evangelist
1:04:14 role
1:04:15 literally this week and
1:04:18 for some of the candidates that we were
1:04:19 looking at they they had been speaking
1:04:22 so get out there start speaking build up
1:04:24 your linkedin
1:04:26 that's a great way to be um
1:04:30 honest and i don't want to make this
1:04:32 answer longer but the other thing too
1:04:33 is if someone could actually convince me
1:04:35 that they're a good speaker i would be
1:04:37 very interested
1:04:38 in hiring them how would they do that
1:04:42 um if they if they presented at a local
1:04:46 conference and they were number one
1:04:48 at that conference like they had some
1:04:49 audience feedback so hey
1:04:51 i presented here 30 speakers i had
1:04:54 feedback i'm the number one but speaker
1:04:56 i have the recorded talk i'd say oh
1:04:58 great i'll watch it i'll watch your
1:05:00 recorded talk
1:05:01 so like that that could be an
1:05:02 opportunity to kind of
1:05:04 um yeah i'm very interested in
1:05:08 but but speaking that's the main way to
1:05:10 kind of build up that speaking
1:05:12 experience
1:05:13 okay maybe for for people who are still
1:05:16 here
1:05:17 on our stream maybe i don't know do you
1:05:20 have any recommendations like a book
1:05:22 a course or something that uh
1:05:25 people who for those who are interested
1:05:28 you know building this
1:05:29 uh public speaking skill what is the
1:05:32 number one thing they should
1:05:34 try after this chat
1:05:38 um so books i like stories that stick
1:05:43 um i forget the author's name so i'm
1:05:45 just gonna read titles there's the hero
1:05:46 with ten thousand faces
1:05:48 there's a book called play bigger it
1:05:50 talks about category creation
1:05:51 which i think is is very useful i i
1:05:55 love um the lean startup by eric reese
1:05:57 it's not
1:05:58 it's not to make you a better speaker
1:05:59 but it kind of i love the mindset of
1:06:01 failing before you start
1:06:03 and so can you fail on a talk before you
1:06:06 start so if i have a talk idea
1:06:08 can i before i invest time and energy
1:06:11 into doing it or like research
1:06:13 if i've got a research i did for a talk
1:06:14 can i just fail today
1:06:17 before i even start can i fail so i love
1:06:18 the idea of failing today
1:06:20 in saving all that time rather than
1:06:22 committing to something
1:06:23 um that's something you can start today
1:06:26 i do love the idea of if you've got kids
1:06:28 start telling them stories today but
1:06:31 these aren't stories you're
1:06:32 reading you're winging it just tell them
1:06:34 a story from your childhood something
1:06:36 stupid you did something funny exciting
1:06:38 sad
1:06:39 tell them a story and and practice that
1:06:42 and if you become i think in the next
1:06:44 year if you become a better storyteller
1:06:47 and the evidence of success as your kids
1:06:49 begin to ask
1:06:50 for another story another story like the
1:06:52 second and so if you if you can really
1:06:54 level up and
1:06:55 and practice maintaining their attention
1:06:57 kids have short attention spans this is
1:06:58 a good practice you know if you have
1:07:00 their attention so practice maintaining
1:07:02 their attention
1:07:03 and if you get better at this you will
1:07:04 be a better speaker
1:07:06 okay well those who don't have kids
1:07:11 there are there are some local meetups i
1:07:14 think toastmasters
1:07:15 okay i've never done toastmasters but i
1:07:17 know they they will go and practice
1:07:19 presenting to each other
1:07:20 to be the same thing like be very a big
1:07:23 part of being a good speaker is having
1:07:25 good
1:07:25 emotional intelligence and being able to
1:07:27 read your audience
1:07:29 if your audience is checking out if
1:07:30 you're if the energy is going down
1:07:32 you have to fix it as a speaker and
1:07:36 and you as a speaker you're not scripted
1:07:38 like you
1:07:39 you can do all sorts of things to fix
1:07:41 that attention and
1:07:43 sometimes it's hard it takes a lot of
1:07:44 energy and sometimes you screw it up
1:07:47 just like a comedian some comedians
1:07:49 they're really funny
1:07:50 and sometimes they have off nights and
1:07:52 they just it doesn't work
1:07:53 they it's terrible so you you need to
1:07:56 practice
1:07:58 i i still have terrible talks on the
1:08:00 horizon
1:08:01 but hopefully more hopefully fewer
1:08:04 than i had before yeah so
1:08:08 that talk where somebody fell asleep was
1:08:11 it recorded
1:08:13 no
1:08:17 um pat pat writes he's teased me that he
1:08:20 has
1:08:21 some recordings on youtube of my early
1:08:24 talks
1:08:24 in the utah text scene that he said were
1:08:27 terrible
1:08:28 so maybe i should i should reach out to
1:08:31 him to see if i can
1:08:33 fish out one of the worst talks ever
1:08:35 recorded that i've given
1:08:37 and it'd be fun now to actually critique
1:08:38 it to
1:08:40 you know break it up and say why it's
1:08:42 bad
1:08:43 okay so i suggest we should be prepping
1:08:46 up because i think your next meeting
1:08:48 starts in 20 minutes and you still need
1:08:50 to reach for
1:08:51 don't think you want to have it from
1:08:53 your car
1:08:54 like this okay so thanks a lot
1:08:57 for coming uh for joining us today and
1:09:00 sharing all these stories
1:09:01 uh with us and demonstrating your
1:09:05 storytelling skills
1:09:07 i think i i don't know i didn't count
1:09:09 the number of stories he told but i
1:09:11 think it was
1:09:11 at least five so
1:09:15 you you reminded me
1:09:19 one last thing so i've had people say
1:09:22 that i have an unfair advantage
1:09:25 and they've said i have an unfair
1:09:26 advantage because some of my stories
1:09:28 are so ridiculous just like one of the
1:09:32 things i didn't mention when i went to
1:09:34 college i lived in the woods
1:09:36 so i lived in the snow and it made
1:09:38 national news in the us
1:09:39 and i had two sponsors so while students
1:09:42 are living indoors going to college
1:09:44 i'm living in the snow every day and so
1:09:48 like i have lots of these types of
1:09:50 stories i used to hitchhike across the
1:09:51 nevada desert
1:09:52 and i did all these things as a kid so i
1:09:55 i have a lot of stories that i can pull
1:09:57 from but
1:09:58 i would argue that everyone everyone has
1:10:01 stories but mine are kind of over the
1:10:02 top
1:10:04 not everyone can uh can you know
1:10:08 pull this i mean like
1:10:12 have this kind of background yeah i
1:10:14 heard about
1:10:15 that i think uh was what i think it was
1:10:18 the revit show
1:10:18 when you talked about this uh your story
1:10:21 about
1:10:22 living in the woods so for those who are
1:10:24 interested maybe
1:10:25 check that and uh i i've got a
1:10:29 a news link i can message you so it's a
1:10:32 youtube channel
1:10:32 they can actually watch the news clip
1:10:34 when i'm 20 or 19
1:10:37 interviews in the news i will definitely
1:10:39 put it in this
1:10:40 in the description in the in the youtube
1:10:42 video so thanks a lot
1:10:44 and if you have any more stories to
1:10:46 share uh maybe you can also send a few
1:10:48 links
1:10:49 yeah okay yes
1:10:52 now it was uh great chatting with you so
1:10:55 yeah thank you sorry about the car
1:10:57 setup it was fun like maybe i can even
1:11:01 say
1:11:01 later hey i had ben in his car not like
1:11:04 in his usual studio
1:11:06 yeah not so many uh podcast costs can
1:11:09 actually
1:11:10 you know say that yeah so i feel
1:11:13 like yeah great great to see you again
1:11:15 alexi thanks for doing this
1:11:17 yes have a nice day
