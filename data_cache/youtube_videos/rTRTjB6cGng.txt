0:00 hi everyone Welcome to our event this
0:02 event is brought to you by data docs lab
0:04 which is a community of people who love
0:06 data we have weekly events and this is
0:09 one of such events if you want to find
0:11 out more about the events we have there
0:12 is a link in the description so go there
0:14 check it out uh I now know that kit here
0:19 that YouTube has a different interface
0:21 now I need to update these slides but
0:24 yeah you will find it just to go below
0:26 the video and there is a link also if
0:29 you have this button click on this
0:30 button subscribe to our Channel this way
0:33 you will not miss any of the amazing
0:35 streams we will have like this one
0:38 and of course we have an amazing slack
0:41 community so if you want to hang out
0:42 with other data enthusiasts check it out
0:45 the link is also in the description
0:47 during today's interview you can ask any
0:49 question you want there is a link in the
0:52 live chat so click on this link ask your
0:54 question and I will be covering these
0:56 questions during the interview
0:58 okay that's
1:01 the usual intro I do so now I will open
1:04 the questions
1:06 we prepared for you did you find them
1:09 yes
1:10 good
1:15 so I guess we can start
1:18 can we yes should I start with the shot
1:21 introduction I assume
1:24 um I'll do a short intro if you don't
1:26 find it but then I'll ask you to also
1:29 talk more about yourself okay so this
1:32 week we'll talk about product owners in
1:34 data science and we have a special
1:36 yesterday Anna Anna is a domain owner
1:39 for data science at Metro digital where
1:41 she drives adoption of data science and
1:44 AI topics within the Metro business and
1:47 Metro is a large
1:49 what they call it a wholesaler
1:52 wholesaler okay so supermarkets right
1:57 previously on the LED product teams in
2:00 areas of recommender systems Robotics
2:02 and smart Logistics in this conversation
2:04 Anna will share her experience working
2:06 as a product owner so welcome Anna
2:10 hi Alexey
2:12 um and as you asked me and maybe to
2:13 liberate a little about it so first of
2:15 all Metra is a wholesaler sometimes you
2:18 think it's very similar to retail in
2:20 some aspects yes and some others not the
2:23 difference we have here is just as our
2:26 customers B2B it's not like just you and
2:28 me are coming there and buy something
2:30 but it's
2:32 um in many situations so we expect
2:34 hotels restaurants and Etc to be our
2:37 customers and
2:39 um you can well we are talking about
2:42 data science expect also changing the
2:44 behavior of a customer for example it's
2:46 very difficult to inspire them to buy to
2:48 try out new things if you imagine a
2:51 restaurant having like it's a pizzeria
2:52 it has these five types of a pizza it
2:56 will not start out of sudden I don't
2:57 know to buy cherries so um that is a
3:01 really special Pizza
3:03 that would be interesting
3:05 for for the recommender systems yes and
3:09 um yeah that is uh and I'm so called
3:12 domain owner responsible for all data
3:15 science uh projects and initiatives in
3:17 at Metro and the area of data science
3:20 and uh so many times I tried to get into
3:24 a mattress store because it's usually
3:26 cheaper but the security wouldn't let me
3:28 in because they wanted to prove the time
3:30 actually because you're doing B2B that
3:33 they always wanted the proof that I am a
3:35 business owner so I always needed to go
3:38 with somebody who can have this proof or
3:41 sometimes I actually when I lived in
3:43 Poland I had macro which is also Metro
3:46 right another name so I managed to sneak
3:49 in sometimes like without any documents
3:51 so and that's an interesting point and
3:54 that's a grand point which you brings
3:55 consulate we are talking to data
3:57 Community but you can think about it you
3:59 know how all people try to get this
4:02 personalized data we have it directly so
4:05 we really know every transactions from
4:07 the beginning of Metro existence is
4:10 assigned to a customer so we always know
4:12 I don't know it has been Anna buying
4:14 that I know five milks on that day and
4:17 time and as a picture is complete
4:20 because many times you know how the
4:22 other companies try to have all the
4:24 loyalty programs with paybacks and you
4:27 name it for sure they're doing it to
4:30 collect data but many times there's like
4:32 a certain piece of sociality who never
4:35 applies for such programs and you have
4:37 just a subset in our case it's complete
4:39 and that is always what they try to sell
4:41 is an advantage for everyone who applies
4:43 for a job at a natural saying like look
4:46 you have directly data to start work
4:48 with
4:49 that's that's cool like you can't do
4:51 data science without data right so the
4:54 main topic for today is product owners
4:56 and data science but before that before
4:58 discussing that I wanted to ask here
5:00 about your career so far so can you tell
5:04 us about uh what you've been uh doing so
5:07 far what's what was your career Journey
5:09 sure I'm more than happy to share as I
5:12 originally started computer science
5:14 uh then in my PhD I was focusing on back
5:18 then it was called Data Mining today we
5:20 can call the data science
5:22 um was focusing of webinar uh
5:25 website so you represent the communities
5:28 as a network and you try to analyze
5:31 which makes are the networks more
5:32 healthy or less healthy and you apply
5:35 different clustering and classifications
5:38 um algorithm to it and as I said try to
5:42 say what drives the community to grow or
5:45 to decline and I was doing this research
5:48 in the area of Open Source projects
5:50 which is pretty interesting to see why
5:52 is that one open source project evolves
5:54 and evaluates and so others like just
5:56 decline so it's pretty interesting do
5:59 you still have because well I also
6:01 happen to run a community which is
6:04 pretty relevant to what you're saying so
6:06 do you have still some of your research
6:09 in Open Access
6:10 uh I don't like I assume my PhD should
6:13 be accessible
6:16 online because I guess a general
6:18 regulation in Germany nevertheless what
6:21 I can tell you like what the the key
6:24 point is
6:25 um You observe this Pareto distribution
6:28 very strongly it's not 80 20 so in open
6:30 source Community it's like 90 to 10. so
6:32 it's like you have really the score of
6:34 some like a very small of a small size
6:39 of a core developers who really like
6:41 making the difference and you have many
6:43 people who just I don't know drop a
6:45 message once maybe submit it a bug
6:47 report so like those are like belong to
6:50 like very very long tail and very uh
6:53 dense core what like because Basin for
6:57 example I was comparing three projects
6:59 which were trying to do the same thing
7:01 it was buy a pearl buyer Java and buy a
7:04 python it is a extension of the
7:08 corresponding languages python Java and
7:10 pearl in order to do some bioinformatics
7:12 and like you would say the application
7:15 is the same the community people should
7:17 be the same and one of the findings was
7:20 you have to have strong interlayer so
7:23 like it shouldn't be that steep so like
7:24 you know you have three people in the
7:26 coins and just the long tail you have to
7:28 have those who are here and they are
7:31 more active because if you're just
7:33 relying on your call on the three to
7:35 five very central people once one of
7:37 them drops out you have really problem
7:39 if you have a strong
7:41 um
7:42 interlayer so something in the middle
7:44 there's a high chances that someone from
7:46 this interlayer will jump on and like
7:49 closes
7:50 um Gap and it's not only you know I was
7:53 able to prove it with this data but I
7:54 have to say all these communities were
7:56 so open I like reached out to them and
7:58 was asking questions say like look that
8:00 is what I see in the data they really
8:01 shared the stories they really said yeah
8:03 here we observe that and that person
8:06 left the community and was really going
8:08 down this progress and so on and people
8:10 got demotivated so I got even yeah not
8:15 only quantitative but also qualitative
8:17 commitments to what I have found
8:19 yeah if anyone who is listening is
8:22 interested in doing some of this kind of
8:24 research and you want to get some data
8:26 from data talks Club reach out please
8:28 that would be quite interesting to to
8:30 try I've I also heard about the rule
8:33 which is uh called 99 one rule so you
8:37 have 90 which are people who are silent
8:39 that nine are active and then one is
8:41 this core I think this is very similar
8:43 to what you mentioned
8:45 yeah sounds too but coming back to my
8:48 biography so like yes I I finished the
8:50 PHD in this area but there was always
8:53 kind of interested in structuring sync
8:55 organizing things and that is why I
8:57 first went to salando where I have been
9:00 responsible for uh smart Logistics at
9:03 automation of the warehouses or the
9:05 warehouses the warehouse not the data
9:07 warehouse but the physical one where you
9:09 store the items on shelves and then you
9:12 do the picking parking and then it's
9:14 transported I send to the people who are
9:17 listening to us and yeah so for example
9:20 one of the tasks was the picking process
9:22 is very time consuming and also work for
9:25 consuming one and um there was a machine
9:29 constructed to automate the process and
9:31 I was responsible for
9:34 integration of this automated machine in
9:37 the processes because it's like you
9:39 still have Workforce which is running
9:41 doing some manual peaking pluses
9:43 automatic machines those are two flows
9:46 which like go apart and you have to
9:48 bring them together at the parking
9:49 station because now you have to bring
9:51 everything together and at the same time
9:54 point also to London have signed the
9:55 contracts for RWS so we were doing like
9:58 someone said hmm yeah we need to develop
10:01 anyways a new piece of software for the
10:04 data for for the warehouse for this
10:06 automatic machine Let's Go directly for
10:08 microservices on AWS so I had like this
10:12 two hats like to streamline the process
10:15 with the task force team to Transitions
10:18 to RWS microservices and to integrate
10:20 this machine
10:22 and that was a very like an important I
10:25 guess experience for my life because it
10:27 was very execution driven it's literally
10:30 if you're working very close to the
10:32 separation uh you can imagine that
10:35 behind every delay someone can put a
10:39 like you know a number of money which
10:41 you are losing it's for example if
10:42 machine is not working you can put a
10:45 number of dollar behind or Heroes behind
10:48 every package which is not sent out on
10:50 time and I learned to work under very
10:53 high pressure and don't get me wrong so
10:55 like the I I do not complain I really
10:58 enjoyed it but it's like just to give
11:01 you a number in the warehouse where I
11:02 have been working at that time we were
11:04 having up to 2 000 workers maybe not
11:08 everyone rely on machine but if you even
11:10 say it's thousands of workers who are
11:11 not able to work because the system is
11:13 down
11:15 uh you can you just know how much you
11:17 pay to every of them every minute and
11:20 because we are you know we are Germany
11:22 like no one will send you home and say
11:24 you have nothing to do we are not paying
11:25 you the people are still there and
11:27 sitting you just I don't know playing
11:28 around and uh there was like brilliant
11:31 management of this warehousing coming to
11:34 me and saying like you know yet another
11:36 minute yet another minute there's like
11:40 um yeah
11:41 uh what what does it mean in terms of
11:43 customer satisfaction and also money we
11:46 are losing and uh then from there I
11:49 moved to a Metro where I was product
11:51 manager for recommender systems and I
11:54 guess that is
11:57 very strongly formed what I am and how
12:00 we managed to really to go from this POC
12:02 situation you're facing a lot of data
12:04 science to really having it as a product
12:06 because I came from this very strong
12:09 driven developed deliver deploy every
12:12 day uh there's so much dependency and
12:15 now I come to the area of data science
12:17 which feels like
12:19 research and I really like Kim and said
12:23 no no we try to take the best things we
12:26 know from computer science and somehow
12:29 to put it together with the things we
12:31 need to do in data science
12:33 and
12:34 um I really do believe that we are
12:36 successful and I really do believe that
12:38 we have to use product management
12:41 approaches for developing successful
12:45 data science products which are then in
12:46 production
12:49 so do you think so you studied computer
12:52 science you studied this data mining and
12:55 websites do you think it helped you with
12:57 what you're doing right now uh yes I do
13:00 think so I still think that uh even in
13:03 management
13:04 um
13:06 in management position and data and Tech
13:08 you need uh to have people with data
13:11 Tech background because I really do
13:14 think that it matters a lot for my
13:17 directors I can understand the language
13:19 they speak and I can also understand why
13:22 for example research here and there is
13:25 still important
13:27 and yeah it also gives a certain respect
13:30 but it's also I'm then able to go and
13:32 advocate for for their needs yeah it's
13:34 not just for me a blah blah I do not
13:36 understand this like okay I got your
13:38 points and I go back to the stakeholders
13:41 and say look I don't know people would
13:43 need more time or the data is not
13:45 sufficient
13:46 or there is like limitation of
13:48 infrastructure
13:50 do you think product owners and product
13:52 managers we will actually talk what it
13:54 means but I'm wondering like they think
13:55 they should have technical background or
13:58 it's nice to have think
14:01 I guess it depends I also know some
14:04 product owners who do not have technical
14:07 degree a background for really great
14:09 people so I guess soft skills are very
14:13 very important
14:17 um also this customer understanding
14:19 really this custom Obsession uh really
14:22 makes sense and makes difference
14:25 um however still I guess depends because
14:27 you know there are for example very
14:28 technical products uh one of example
14:30 would be at Metra if you get out of data
14:33 sense we have Cloud foundation so it's a
14:35 product about
14:37 um you know giving you a piece of cloud
14:39 infrastructure I guess you have to be
14:42 very technical product managers there
14:44 otherwise you do not understand what
14:45 what it's all about and you can then
14:47 also not be that passionate about it no
14:51 if they're not talking about really
14:53 customer customer facing things like End
14:56 customer facing yeah and then you really
14:58 can connect yourself with the end-end
15:00 customer and say I'm patient about this
15:01 product because I am this active use of
15:04 this app so yeah maybe it's not that
15:08 sufficient
15:11 so what do product owners actually do so
15:13 who are they
15:17 uh yeah I mean first of all maybe if the
15:20 question is between the difference
15:22 between product owners and product
15:23 managers
15:24 I guess it's all
15:27 I think they're like a definition so
15:30 which is where the connection is wait
15:32 wait wait they think the connection is
15:34 breaking so yeah what I was saying yeah
15:37 who are product owners so not
15:39 necessarily it's also interesting to see
15:41 the the comparison because you mentioned
15:43 that you joined Metro as a product
15:45 manager but I think you're yeah but I
15:48 think your title is product owner right
15:51 um my title is today domain owner so now
15:53 I'm like given the the stage app but you
15:56 know back then it was product owner but
15:58 again we have three adjustments to
16:00 product managers and I guess in Thailand
16:02 it was the other way around so I see
16:04 there's like not at least maybe someone
16:07 can write it to us in uh the chat but I
16:11 have experienced it a lot in enough
16:13 companies where like you really don't
16:15 know what's the difference and like
16:16 today it's product managers and there's
16:18 some restructuring and it's product
16:19 owner but for me it's um
16:22 because I sometimes asked by friends
16:25 okay Coach me what what do I need to do
16:27 to be a product manager so that it's my
16:29 personal definition
16:30 I guess the most important thing is to
16:33 be able to take decisions
16:35 yeah and that's what I learned not only
16:39 like for sure on the stressful situation
16:42 with a warehouse where it's about like
16:44 Are We Now sending the next thousands of
16:46 items out or not it's really like a very
16:48 strong decision you have to take but
16:50 even data science it's like every time a
16:52 decision yeah so uh your data centers
16:55 will come and say the model is that good
16:58 but maybe if you give us two more weeks
17:01 we can try to improve it a lot and for
17:03 example being brave enough to say I
17:06 believe it's now good enough I'm clearly
17:08 communicating the quality towards
17:10 stakeholders but now is the time to go
17:12 live this ability to be brave to make
17:15 decisions that is really something very
17:17 needed for being a good product owner
17:20 product manager
17:22 then uh yeah being patient about what
17:24 you're doing
17:26 I really love it and because what I see
17:30 for me as a product owner is someone who
17:32 sits between stakeholders and uh the
17:36 developers or data scientists so it's on
17:39 one hand side a translator from
17:42 requirements to the team but it's also
17:44 an advocate and a shield for the people
17:48 yes it's someone who really protects the
17:51 team in the sense I don't know the
17:53 expectations are not right or you know
17:55 how often I have these discussions like
17:57 how about you take one person and it's
18:00 ready tomorrow and then you you let us
18:03 also product manager who sits in between
18:05 says no we need this and that because
18:08 the process requires when if we are
18:11 talking a very good example data science
18:13 here people like take one ft and solve
18:16 the problem and like you know you have
18:18 to safety ft uh so one person no okay
18:22 what does it stand for
18:24 optional something that resources you
18:28 can Google I don't know
18:30 and then I
18:34 then I say like you need someone who
18:35 will
18:36 orchestrate the whole movie flow you
18:38 need what data scientists you need some
18:40 devops or maybe data engineer and it's
18:43 not right that you just say yeah like
18:46 you take it from there and like you data
18:48 scientists do it now so to summarize
18:50 being able to to make this vision and
18:52 risk uh to protect your team to be a
18:55 good interpreter you know for
18:57 interpreter from stakeholders to your
18:59 team and from Team back to the
19:01 stakeholders and the last but not least
19:03 being really passionate about what
19:05 you're doing
19:06 so what you described right now is a
19:09 product owner product manager or both uh
19:12 yeah yeah me it's like product owner so
19:14 product Mona like I guess people put
19:17 into product manager more execution
19:19 product owners in like you know you're a
19:22 CEO of your product so I tend more to be
19:27 like on the product owner site
19:29 by execution because product manager I
19:31 guess it's the one who more managing
19:34 like you know streamlining the process
19:36 taking less ownership so that is where I
19:40 see the difference
19:42 so this is what you mean by execution
19:44 right so managing managing the process
19:47 like uh making sure the team is working
19:49 fine uh all these rituals like I don't
19:52 know like uh scrum Sprints like
19:55 estimating all that things are done by
19:57 product managers usually or
20:00 I mean you still have agile coaches or
20:02 scrum coaches or whatever they uh call
20:05 today to to follow up with rituals but I
20:08 guess it's a nutshell and as I said
20:10 there's
20:11 um not always it's much of a difference
20:13 it depends on your who you ask but in my
20:16 eyes product owners like really this CEO
20:19 of a product and managers like maybe has
20:23 less uh Power and maybe has to listen
20:27 more to the tech lead and other teams
20:29 but I mean I'm more than happy to hear
20:32 about the audience things
20:34 I'm just curious um I did work with
20:36 product owners and then
20:38 um so in some companies they have just
20:41 product owners some companies have just
20:42 product managers so in the company where
20:45 I worked at right now were elix we only
20:48 have product managers we don't have
20:49 product owners and I'm just wondering so
20:53 in this case if there is no product
20:55 officially product owner in the team
20:57 then the product manager wears this hat
20:59 right so they make these decisions uh
21:03 like uh the decisions you said okay we
21:06 need to ship it now right or we need to
21:07 wait for two more weeks and then there
21:10 is also you mentioned that product
21:12 managers work together with tech leads
21:15 right yeah correct correct so I guess
21:18 that can be ownership and oh nasia
21:21 correct and what is then in your company
21:24 Alexa is the next like to to whom
21:27 product managers to report head of
21:29 product head of product okay in our
21:31 cases like domain own nothing but again
21:34 that's just the naming but
21:36 [Music]
21:37 yeah and in chat I see that FTE stands
21:41 for full-time equivalent yeah
21:43 like full-time employee yeah full-time
21:46 okay yeah yeah so that's that's normally
21:48 like this ideal city you know other
21:50 discussions I have a lot like can we
21:52 have one like budget for one person but
21:55 this one person can cover three use
21:57 cases from data science and then let's
22:00 start off uh the task also of product
22:02 owner to say no it's not doable and
22:04 explain why
22:07 so I think you described more or less
22:10 what you did see you said that you were
22:13 taking care of recommender systems right
22:16 at Metro digital so what did you do
22:18 there as a product owner how did you
22:20 exactly
22:21 take care of recommender systems
22:24 uh so when I joined Metro there were
22:27 like one and a half people more or less
22:29 and it was more yeah as I already like
22:32 placed to the kind of VR research
22:34 environment I mean we were getting
22:36 requests here and there from a dedicated
22:39 country which like now runs like plant
22:42 or to have a campaign and the next month
22:45 and they try to say okay it's also
22:47 products we would love to put under a
22:49 special offer to whom should we send it
22:52 out in newsletter and that was pretty
22:54 manual because it was like really you
22:57 get this list of products I mean it
23:00 still maybe was somewhere in a database
23:01 but it was like still many like here the
23:03 products so there are here the target
23:06 groups we would love to to face there
23:08 was a collaborative filtering in between
23:10 but it was like really
23:12 there was a request manual processing
23:15 and that the results generated and again
23:19 shared written somewhere in database and
23:21 when I came I saw the game
23:24 it doesn't scale so with this uh first
23:27 of all I mean how my how many people
23:29 should we hire and uh back then we'll be
23:32 operating 25 countries in meanwhile we
23:34 are in 23 but it's still like
23:37 how like you as a white like this over a
23:41 highly paid data scientists spending
23:44 half of their time actually exchanging
23:47 their emails back and forth which group
23:49 should be picked and uh I don't know
23:52 just clicking on a button waiting until
23:55 till this will calculate and I went
23:58 there and said like no no no I want to
24:00 have a use case but we clearly so that
24:03 we are API and we do hear real software
24:05 development as I was used from zalanda
24:09 so we first of all introduced the whole
24:11 agile setup with stand-ups with Sprints
24:15 like two week Sprints we try to really
24:17 set as a goals for two weeks so it's in
24:20 terms of processes which changed it a
24:22 lot uh but also in terms of our Target
24:26 group I mean we still support to be
24:28 honest we still support uh this um a use
24:32 case of newsletter but we automated it a
24:34 lot and there's like dedicated support
24:36 to people who just doing nothing but
24:38 this execution
24:40 uh but we uh I said clearly okay where's
24:43 the use case where we can use the end
24:46 point and that is for sure our online
24:47 shop yeah so we went to the online shop
24:49 and we said uh so there says
24:52 um you go to online shop you're looking
24:54 at for example banana and then there's
24:56 underneath frequently bought together so
24:59 people who were buying banana were also
25:01 interesting in that and that and uh I
25:05 said that's great yeah we just provides
25:07 them an end point and they integrate on
25:09 it and uh back then I guess mshop was
25:12 like mshop is Metro shop Metro online
25:14 shop was present like in 10 countries
25:17 and then they went up to 12th and then
25:19 they went up to 18. and for us it was
25:21 not because we trained our model already
25:22 for all 25 countries so it's like every
25:25 country they took life if you're already
25:27 lives there how great is it yeah so that
25:29 is really scaling
25:31 and then there was just one flow created
25:35 one one ml floor uh there was a API we
25:39 were able like to set a data dock upon
25:41 on it to see how reliable it is and we
25:44 also didn't took care of anything like
25:46 our endpoint just says okay given a
25:49 product and a customer who are looking
25:50 at what are the best sticks frequent
25:53 people together will be so we just
25:56 um submit uh the results in form of IDs
25:59 and that is the rest is like
26:01 responsibility of a customer facing
26:03 solution
26:05 uh to grab the right pictures or
26:07 descriptions the right price and that is
26:09 also great because then you as a data
26:11 science team you really focus on the
26:13 core task you are not trying to see okay
26:16 I don't know do I have a description of
26:19 whatsoever so can cancer results be
26:21 complete yeah because many times if you
26:23 just do the manual process you're
26:25 consuming party starts yeah but can you
26:27 also search for the pictures or submit
26:30 the results with the pictures or
26:32 whatsoever so uh this one uh was like
26:36 one of the things we also took a clear
26:39 step
26:40 um then we extended our portfolio uh we
26:44 banned to Alternative recommender that
26:46 is one if you're looking to um
26:49 uh product and it's not available
26:51 because we don't want our customer to be
26:54 disappointed and uh Alexey you said in
26:56 the beginning you have been to Metro you
26:58 know it has a huge assortment so
27:00 normally if you don't have this
27:01 dedicated milk there's like at least 50
27:04 other milk types which will be having
27:07 the same percentage of fat the same size
27:11 everything and it really makes sense
27:13 just to to propose
27:15 a reasonable alternative because and
27:19 that's to do it in personal manner yeah
27:21 so that is another one so once it's
27:23 something out of stock it says we have
27:25 the following alternatives for you and
27:27 last but not least was
27:30 um as a recommender which again where we
27:33 started you know I told you like okay
27:35 given the special offers to whom it's
27:37 relevant and I was like the whole time
27:39 thinking okay but I I can do more out of
27:41 it I can do more of it like can use
27:43 letters is a manual process but where
27:45 can we have it more
27:48 um automatic one and it's our app we
27:51 have M companion it's an app of Metro
27:53 and you go there's like several tabs and
27:56 one tap a special offer and in the past
27:59 it was like just all products are under
28:01 offer they were listed there
28:03 so it can be for example you have a
28:06 vision
28:07 uh restaurant so not selling any foods
28:10 any meat stuff but because we have meat
28:13 now you know on special offer you were
28:15 getting meat on the top and I guess many
28:17 customers got also kind of pissed like
28:19 why you're offering it to me I'm it's
28:21 not relevant and here we applied it like
28:25 we take every time the office updated we
28:28 take the offers and uh we uh train our
28:33 model to home like 200 top recommenders
28:37 rank in the order of relevance per
28:40 customer and when you go to this app and
28:44 click on offers your list will be
28:46 different from me and again it's like
28:48 I'm companion go rolls out to a new
28:50 country heavier it's an end point it's
28:54 directly served we can update it we're
28:57 independent we can run an A B test
28:59 without creating any problems and that
29:02 is approach I would recommend everyone
29:04 to do
29:05 so you mentioned three use cases first
29:08 is a newsletter so all the clients of
29:10 Metra receive newsletters with uh
29:13 personalized recommendations right but I
29:16 think you you said it's like you segment
29:19 first and then each segment gets the
29:20 same newsletter right more or less or no
29:23 no it's really personalized it's really
29:25 customer to product so you you can yeah
29:27 why not I mean you can really so then
29:29 you have that then you have online shop
29:33 there you have a recommender system and
29:34 then finally in the app right so three
29:37 places yeah but actually like I would
29:39 count to this four because alternative
29:40 recommended frequently but together they
29:43 are really two different recommenders
29:44 it's also like the one is just the one
29:47 is cross-sell I try to encourage you to
29:49 sell more so really saying like I don't
29:51 know you're looking at Banana by by also
29:53 an apple uh alternative is just you're
29:56 looking bananas this banana is not
29:57 available take another banana
30:00 okay and uh just uh Curious so you set
30:05 when you joined Metro there were one and
30:07 a half people
30:09 and then you said that you need software
30:12 Engineers you need I don't know agile
30:15 process so who was on the team and who
30:18 did you need to hire yeah it's a very
30:21 great learning I also always love to
30:24 share so I thought it was also run Glitz
30:27 our very first position description we
30:31 were looking for people with PhD in
30:33 mathematics and science and statistics
30:36 and I still do believe you need those
30:38 yeah don't get me wrong but the question
30:40 is about amount and um
30:43 it depends on the like how far you're in
30:46 a process sometimes you're still in POC
30:48 and trying out things but once you're
30:50 like pretty ready with the uh model and
30:52 you're just improving it it's enough to
30:54 have one data scientist per use case
30:56 maybe
30:58 uh but we're pretty quickly
31:01 recognize that if you want really to do
31:03 this productionized software yeah
31:05 something which runs into production if
31:07 as I said like 24 7 where we have the
31:10 whole infrastructure the data doc so I
31:13 don't know ml flow and so on so on that
31:16 we need a real Engineers or today
31:19 they're called machine learning
31:20 engineers and sometimes ml Ops depends a
31:24 little I would really say from today's
31:27 perspective I have you need boss rolls
31:30 and they're a little different because
31:31 ml flow is really like how do you
31:33 structure the flow like here to some
31:36 Hotel bring it there retrain risk on and
31:39 so on and their ml Ops it's like being
31:43 able to create this ideal infrastructure
31:45 for machine learning projects and
31:47 sometimes they get asked and like okay
31:50 what is the ratio
31:52 again depending on how far you're in a
31:54 broad process
31:56 uh at the beginning you can start like
31:57 one to one yeah so someone will engineer
32:01 one and then oops Yeah and one data
32:04 scientist yeah so that should be your
32:06 basis but once you're going more and
32:08 more into production and as I said there
32:11 are like maybe just some improvements of
32:14 your model but it's also all about like
32:16 being stable and running uh then it can
32:19 be up to three Engineers for one data
32:22 scientist
32:23 okay and let's say you don't have money
32:27 for three people who will you hire first
32:30 again depends uh where I'm staying I
32:34 mean if it's really completely new new
32:35 you uh use case it's um
32:38 well there may be data scientists or so
32:40 ideally I would go for a general list so
32:43 again if someone listening now to us
32:45 full stack right yeah feels like if you
32:48 really want to be a kind of the person
32:51 everyone wants to have it tries to
32:53 involve yourself evolve yourself to the
32:55 generalist role so someone at least who
32:58 can set up some basic infrastructure
33:00 create some ml flow plus interested and
33:04 understands data science
33:08 um yeah that is where I would start what
33:10 I also do I mean I can be also very
33:12 honest also with our audience because I
33:13 guess it's not
33:15 um a secret for some initiative where I
33:18 don't know if I should hire someone long
33:21 term I would also reach out to some
33:23 external support yeah so like okay let's
33:26 because because external support you can
33:28 reduce and increase pretty dynamically
33:31 and once I know okay that is something I
33:33 would love to go for or the business
33:36 it's really like shots it's not I says
33:38 and maybe let me take it back so if you
33:41 really see that it's improves the
33:42 business and there is a potential then
33:44 we go to hire people and there's another
33:47 approach we also use and maybe also a
33:49 recommendation towards our audience
33:52 um
33:52 I found that many people and today I
33:56 have already 22 directs so they're
33:59 always willing to learn something new
34:00 and you can also ask around just an
34:03 existing resources if they would love to
34:05 have I don't know 20 commitment or maybe
34:08 even 50 commitment for the next three
34:10 months to run in POC because
34:14 it says a great
34:16 sync to back to give back to your people
34:18 like just to say like look that's
34:20 another use case I mean that is also
34:21 what they put on their CV yeah they say
34:23 I was I don't know creating machine
34:25 learning model for recommendous and
34:27 markdown so that's what we have done so
34:30 maybe someone who participated in both
34:33 listening now I know who I mentioned
34:35 and I got like really great feedback
34:38 people like oh I learned completely new
34:39 piece of data and new business partner
34:42 and so on and then after you have done
34:45 it in this setup you then can say okay
34:47 that is the people I need and you decide
34:49 whether you hire or you relocate
34:52 and there is a question from Valeria
34:54 what kind of recommender systems or
34:57 probably algorithms did you use was it
34:59 collaborative filtering or was it
35:01 different from each for each of the use
35:02 cases you had yeah it's it's different
35:04 for each of these cases uh collaborating
35:07 filtering we're using for scoring uh
35:11 already
35:12 um and I mean let me get here clear I'm
35:15 already like since one and a half years
35:16 I'm in this domain online position
35:18 network and that clause and maybe it's
35:21 my information won't be up to date uh
35:24 but we're also using modification of
35:26 what to vac also to uh to find the
35:30 combination from uh people to so being
35:34 able to scores relevance of products to
35:36 people
35:37 so this work to back is for things that
35:41 are frequently bought together yes
35:45 there is a special modification like
35:47 normally you would expect like this
35:48 tries to you know to use the semantic
35:50 but that's also like learn semantic out
35:52 of your transactional data
35:54 do we actually need to go to get into
35:57 technical details so for all that as a
35:59 product owner like did you need to know
36:01 that okay this is this specific uh word
36:04 to deck modification or was it something
36:07 that you just wanted to learn because of
36:09 your background
36:11 you don't you should understand the
36:13 basic and you should be able to
36:15 challenge it with the right questions so
36:18 for example what we have done and um
36:21 I kind of experimentalist at a certain
36:23 time of time point you know how like uh
36:27 people who has done and maybe even PhD
36:30 and
36:32 Mathematics statistics or computer
36:34 science uh they got used to reading some
36:37 scientific papers and there are great
36:39 scientific papers outside and uh here
36:42 and there was always the situation
36:44 someone coming can say like you know
36:46 over the weekend I was reading this
36:47 paper and I think it's a great idea
36:49 let's try it out
36:51 um I really wanted to show that I value
36:54 this
36:55 um ambition and this you know time
36:57 invest but I also didn't want us to jump
37:00 on every new paper like let's implement
37:02 it so what one of the link was we
37:05 created sometime point a table just a
37:07 basic table in Confluence but we were
37:10 collecting all this idea so you really
37:12 like place a link to the paper you write
37:14 a short summary but it was an important
37:17 thing was that there was like two
37:18 columns one column asking like yeah is
37:22 it uh what what it is good for like is
37:25 it good for uh making calculation
37:28 quicker
37:29 or is it good for improving the
37:33 um Quality that's like promise accuracy
37:36 and
37:38 coming back to your question so that is
37:40 very important that you understand that
37:42 you can ask these questions yeah so and
37:44 challenge people and it's give sometimes
37:47 really feedback to to the people that
37:48 they recognize no you're right it's only
37:50 for I don't know they'll speed up the
37:52 process and you say okay we train today
37:55 model every once a week do we need to
37:58 like will that make difference that
38:00 today's runs for two hours and then it
38:01 will run for one hour and a half will it
38:04 like influence the business and then
38:05 people like okay you're right it will
38:08 not
38:09 so I don't think that I have to
38:12 understand any product on a product
38:13 manager I have to understand it's very
38:15 detailed but
38:17 you have to understand data science
38:19 principles and what it is about what
38:22 does it mean like a metric what does it
38:25 mean a quality what does it mean
38:28 any other type of improvement
38:32 and now you work as a data science
38:34 domain owner so how is it different from
38:37 a product owner so I think you answered
38:39 that question right so you are now a
38:42 manager of product owners uh yeah yeah
38:45 no no no no no no no no no wait because
38:48 it's a difference I'm not I'm uh it's
38:50 it's not like a head of product it's a
38:52 head of data science people so the
38:56 people who are holding a role of data
38:59 scientists or data analysts they do
39:01 report to me but they are then part of a
39:03 product team and product people do
39:05 report into a head of product yeah okay
39:08 so so it's like head of data science in
39:11 our case engineering yes head of data
39:14 science within engineering organization
39:16 and the idea is like that I at least
39:20 it kind of sitting there in the middle
39:22 so I will I can ensure that we are not
39:25 doing the same thing like five times
39:28 because it's like somehow Streamlight
39:29 over my hand
39:31 I also play an umbrella bring in you
39:34 know data scientists from this team
39:36 together with data set from this team
39:37 and say like look at SIMS that you're
39:39 doing the similar stuff maybe you should
39:41 exchange or maybe just support each
39:43 other
39:44 and I can then enable what they just
39:47 described this rotation yeah so to say
39:49 like Alexis we have a new initiative in
39:53 I don't know in McDon do you want to try
39:55 it out
39:58 but you said you managed 25 people two
40:02 but are they your direct reports yes so
40:06 you actually need to do like performance
40:08 review all this appraisals everything
40:10 that in addition to yeah
40:13 you know knowing all these domains yeah
40:16 it's a lot it's a lot yeah it's a lot
40:20 and it's also especially like because a
40:24 certain amount of understanding is still
40:25 required like people do expect me to be
40:27 able like yeah data science expert tell
40:30 us and uh we have very like I like we
40:34 have eight
40:36 uh big cases like big data science cases
40:39 and they are really a broad range so
40:41 even I have a great focus on
40:44 um recommenders there I can also go in
40:46 detail because it's like where
40:47 originally coming from but as I said we
40:50 have the smackdown initiative so what is
40:52 the optimal discount given that high
40:56 expiration date of this product or we
40:58 also even giving credits I don't know if
41:01 you know it but in Metro is a big
41:03 customer you can get a loan like you get
41:05 it in a bank and for this week do a
41:08 credit scoring it's completely new like
41:10 another you know area and we also try to
41:14 do some Dynamic pricing and we do
41:18 assortment optimization and yeah it's
41:22 challenging to be aware everywhere up to
41:26 date but as I said I try I try hard plus
41:30 I assume I know what questions to ask
41:33 so what does markdown mean because in my
41:36 world so for me markdown is what I use
41:39 in GitHub when I create a document it
41:42 says this is a markup format so but I
41:45 don't think you talk about you no what
41:48 is SmackDown uh it's actually great use
41:51 case and you know how the whole world
41:53 today talking about sustainability and
41:56 waste reduction so it goes into this
41:58 direction so what you try to say uh to
42:00 do our what your model is doing uh you
42:03 know how many uh how many products are
42:06 left with a certain BBD BBD is best
42:09 before day so for example you have a
42:11 hundreds of yogurts left of this type
42:14 and the expiring in three days so you um
42:19 what's an uh the system tries to
42:23 calculate what is the optimal discount
42:25 we should give so that we will be able
42:29 to sell out all hundreds of yogurts
42:31 without losing too much of money
42:35 so what is happening I can even explain
42:37 you the concept of a model so you are
42:39 more or less based on like on elasticity
42:41 you know like price versus how people
42:43 are willing to buy it you say how much I
42:47 predict to sell is the price that level
42:50 and you go through all the created
42:53 prices and you take the minimum the
42:57 minimum discount which brings you two in
43:01 series selling everything out
43:03 and there's like three touches
43:05 underneath you for sure want to reduce
43:07 waste yeah I mean in some countries we
43:10 even like it's not only like we put the
43:12 foot to the donation but we still pay
43:15 money on top
43:16 yes it's like really a penalty you have
43:18 to pick uh so we reduce the waste while
43:21 white is throws things away the second
43:23 thing is
43:25 to increase our Revenue I mean if we
43:27 manage you know if you just maybe start
43:29 three days in advance to do a discount
43:31 and you manage to sell everything you
43:33 may be almost lost nothing
43:36 and last but not least also streamlining
43:39 the process and that is also very
43:41 interesting but I would love to share
43:42 with the community
43:43 sometimes it's about
43:46 the automation which data science brings
43:48 brings a clear process because feedback
43:52 we got about markdown in the beginning
43:54 was not about the numbers it's about the
43:57 automatic process now it's a system so
44:00 there's an app with which it's called M
44:02 store for Metro in the store and the
44:04 customer the employee runs with it and
44:07 it sells you now okay now you have to
44:08 Discount This Yogurt by 20 and then the
44:12 employee is just doing it before it was
44:15 uh employee had to follow some gear
44:18 guidelines as guidelines were somewhere
44:20 so every time you had a new employee you
44:22 have to own but him or her and there was
44:25 also a very
44:26 um depend on the store also fraud fraud
44:29 in the sense Alexa you're my friend you
44:32 just come I book a 50 stickers on this
44:35 yogurt and you take them
44:37 and that is also like was what was like
44:40 taken out it just it was a clear process
44:43 and clear guideline and the person don't
44:45 have to think about it
44:47 was it you or your teams who needed to
44:51 think about this process or did you have
44:55 help from the actual you know operations
44:58 who like people who run in the in the
45:01 store so how did it look like
45:03 uh it is a business who came this
45:05 proposal so in my eyes that is actually
45:08 I mean it's a great if you have yourself
45:10 Visionary and you have great ideas but I
45:14 truly believe that it's business
45:16 operations
45:17 or your customer who knows where the
45:21 problem are or where the problems are
45:23 but they want to solve and that is where
45:26 we should start I always say like
45:29 tell us uh it's a dependent data
45:31 analytics data science I go to
45:33 businesses that tell us what is your
45:35 problem tell us what you would love to
45:37 have improved and that is where you have
45:40 to
45:41 to start solving but yeah hello
45:45 but sometimes it's also
45:48 um
45:49 can be also challenges distracted
45:57 okay just one second
45:59 he got a bit of attention now here
46:02 yeah I lost my thought okay I wanted to
46:05 ask you what does it actually mean to be
46:07 responsible for a domain so because you
46:12 have fixed domains right so if I I think
46:15 this is according to your LinkedIn so
46:18 this domains I think you've talked about
46:19 all of them or most of them
46:20 recommendation systems turn mark down
46:23 fulfillment royalty pricing you also
46:26 mentioned this new initiative which is
46:28 credit scoring which is yes one right
46:31 yeah
46:33 and then it's just one person who needs
46:36 to over see all of that which is you
46:39 so what does it mean to be responsible
46:41 for a domain and well how do you even
46:44 manage to uh you know look after so many
46:47 things I mean the data scientists are
46:50 like those data products they're still
46:52 parts of a product team so for example
46:54 you can see let's let stay with markdown
46:57 where there's uh three teams responsible
47:00 for this m store this application will
47:02 really described because uh the
47:04 employees are using it I don't know to
47:06 receive new Goods to report some damages
47:10 and so on and this is just a normal like
47:12 three product teams with developers who
47:15 are like developing front-end back-ends
47:17 on and mark down there it's just yet
47:19 another service yeah so that means I
47:22 have at the moment uh two people and
47:24 some external support
47:26 are responsible for this piece but there
47:29 are parts so they have a product manager
47:31 who streamlines it and uh push it
47:33 forwards there locally so it's not that
47:36 I have to oversee it on daily basis
47:39 but I still need to understand because
47:42 like it goes hand in hand with people
47:44 management so if people like my directs
47:47 will maybe give some feedback complain
47:49 or I don't know would love to raise some
47:52 proposals they sometimes want me to be
47:54 pulled in sometimes I also happy to
47:57 challenge something based on my
47:58 experience for example if they say ah we
48:00 would love now to improve this and that
48:02 yeah so I will be pulled in and also if
48:06 there's a proposal to try something
48:08 completely new again it's me being there
48:11 but I don't need to oversee the process
48:14 on the like this dailies retross and so
48:18 on that's happening in this dedicated
48:19 product teams the same for recommended
48:21 yeah so they have their own product one
48:24 of the same for the position for the
48:25 children and Syrian they have product
48:27 owner gel coach and they go but I'm the
48:31 wonderful can re-rotate people who
48:34 overseas it in rough detail who is
48:37 called if there's like need to be a
48:39 justification
48:41 do you also manage budgets
48:43 you know that okay because here you you
48:47 said this FTE like you probably operate
48:50 in these terms like okay for this
48:52 project we have I don't know two and a
48:53 half ftes for this project just one and
48:55 a half
48:56 yeah well that's what you do okay how
48:59 did it so when I Was preparing questions
49:02 it was just seven domain six domains now
49:05 you also mentioned this new one how does
49:08 it happen then you get a new entirely
49:11 new domain what's the process so your
49:14 main entirely new use case uh yeah so as
49:17 I said uh many many ways and sometimes
49:21 it's really like
49:23 um business will come and say we would
49:26 need a
49:28 we have a great idea yeah and they are
49:31 that's really where I have to be active
49:33 first of all to justify is it just is
49:36 the idea really uh a big enough because
49:41 I will be honest
49:43 I have seen situations when
49:46 um I get like ah AI we have some text
49:49 issues in our data can we use to correct
49:52 it and they're like okay uh what are we
49:55 talking about yes some broken entries
49:57 and like how many entries we are talking
49:59 about like this was 200 and like you are
50:02 not doing any text AI for 200 entries
50:04 hire yourself a student to walk off for
50:07 two hours and let him or her correct it
50:09 manually and you are done so this kind
50:12 of conversation I'm driving so that is
50:14 the one that can be that I push back to
50:16 the business uh nevertheless there are
50:19 great ideas for example assortment was
50:21 this situation so there was like
50:25 um a business side comments saying like
50:27 we have great ideas how we can uh we
50:31 need to reduce assortment so that is
50:33 part of our big journey of a Metro we
50:36 would love to optimize this or maybe not
50:38 to reduce Optimus really to to see what
50:40 is driving our customer into the store
50:43 and it's a great data sense task and I
50:46 was very very inspired because as I said
50:50 it's great but bring me some money for
50:53 people no because uh sometimes it's also
50:57 stops there so you say bring me the
50:58 money for people and then I hire you the
51:00 best talent I ensure they have a right
51:03 set up but we need to hire new people do
51:05 not expect me to like that doesn't sound
51:07 like 20 on top project
51:10 yeah and then for example if that is
51:12 happening then you can start running and
51:16 as I said it's a nutshell I always
51:18 prefer if the idea coming from business
51:22 okay yeah interesting
51:25 so you mentioned that I really love this
51:29 that you can just hire somebody to do
51:33 this because it's just 200 rows right
51:34 and somebody can just go through this
51:36 and I think this is what the I as a data
51:39 scientist say have problems with because
51:41 for me everything like machine learning
51:44 is a hammer and I want to use it for
51:45 every nail right but then sometimes it's
51:48 sometimes medium work is uh it's boring
51:51 but it gets the job done and then
51:54 yeah that's that's interesting
51:58 I mean sometimes maybe let's add here
52:00 something sometimes I would agree to do
52:03 some manual effort but manual not in the
52:07 sense that like correctly like
52:09 correcting 200 lines it will be two or
52:12 100 entries it will never get to go but
52:15 if sometimes people will come and say I
52:18 would love you to optimize assortment
52:20 I'm not sure that if you're able to do
52:22 it like you as a data science not me
52:24 personally then I'm okay to say we do
52:28 something more like you know at the
52:29 level of Jupiter notebook and then the
52:31 results are just here and CSV and we uh
52:35 let's respond
52:36 um corresponding category manager to
52:38 check the results it's completely not
52:41 the way I want to have it so normally
52:42 I'm taught
52:45 need CSV Excel whatever but to get a
52:49 foot and a door
52:51 I would sometimes agree to do this kind
52:53 of a small proof of our abilities
52:58 that we get this Buy in
53:00 but really with clear communication it
53:03 is not the process yeah we just can
53:05 service user results and use and check
53:08 okay
53:09 see a question from Jamie that by the
53:13 way do you know what is a project
53:14 product portfolio management principles
53:18 uh we don't have something like I know
53:21 that some companies like sap so I have a
53:23 French is a portfolio manager and sap
53:26 but I don't uh we don't have something
53:28 like that because the question is
53:30 whether you use this for determining
53:33 products which should have
53:35 do which you should have and how much
53:38 resources uh to put there if I if I
53:42 understand the question correctly but
53:43 yeah I guess as a portfolio I mean you
53:45 would now say okay there are eight use
53:47 cases I names there's also it's my
53:49 portfolio and you somehow where I decide
53:51 I have created something like this I I
53:54 have it's just a list of questions I
53:56 always share someone approaching with
53:58 the idea so obviously I have some other
54:00 structures there and
54:02 um but as I said from their own there's
54:04 not it's more overtime developed process
54:07 and uh it is like take this commitment
54:11 from some internals with this 20
54:13 overtime see if you bring in maybe some
54:16 externals and then see how it goes
54:20 okay and uh yeah I see that we don't
54:23 have a lot of time there are a lot more
54:26 that I actually wanted to ask you but
54:29 one thing I'm really curious is that I
54:31 know that you're one of the
54:32 co-organizers of product tank in
54:34 Dusseldorf and I'm wondering what is
54:38 this what is this thing what is product
54:39 tank
54:41 uh product like there's a very big
54:43 Community called mind the product uh
54:47 created that's uh originate from London
54:49 and
54:52 um
54:53 uh the uh initiate of the whole mind the
54:57 product Community that's grow product
54:59 management and uh you can create this
55:03 get a coorgonize of product tank in your
55:06 city so you officially then belong to
55:09 this kind of Corporation or like your
55:12 your franchising under their name and
55:16 that is a Meetup you try to run
55:18 regularly about the product topics and
55:21 we have for example one on Thursday in a
55:24 week so on 27th and yeah we we try to
55:27 bring like product faults but also like
55:30 everyone else talking about how to
55:33 create great products for example next
55:35 time we will be talking about hypothesis
55:38 driven development uh via testing and
55:42 automation yeah that's of an offline
55:45 Meetup right
55:47 uh it is offline so next one it will be
55:51 offline again for two years we are doing
55:55 it's like trying to do it um remotely I
55:58 guess the first two remote one the real
56:02 success we even managed to get some
56:04 product owners I don't know there's one
56:06 lady connection from New York and giving
56:09 the talk and it was so kind of motivated
56:12 and now you can have uh speakers from
56:14 all over the world but I have to admit
56:17 after two first sessions we were so like
56:19 kind of I had the feeling everyone was
56:21 tired yet now again
56:24 are you already in your meetings the
56:26 whole day online for eight hours and
56:28 then you have to sit down and listen
56:29 again to yet another speaker and um yeah
56:33 we were not uh doing much last year but
56:36 this year that's again a live event and
56:39 just sort of okay and now what we are
56:42 doing now is contributing to this uh you
56:45 know after eight hours of meetings now
56:48 you see them down and listen to us but
56:50 maybe it's not a bad thing at the end
56:52 right and uh if it's evening for you and
56:55 of working day yeah not a bad way to
56:58 finish your Friday
57:00 yeah it's for sure I guess there's a
57:02 difference is like here people are like
57:03 maybe yeah at least like willing to
57:06 watch and like educate themselves and
57:08 see as an opinion uh a big part of
57:10 product and Community was the community
57:12 this new network can just be together
57:14 this food together and that is a piece
57:17 which then yeah kind of uh got lost and
57:23 uh that is also I guess what people are
57:25 looking forward
57:26 did you ever ask yourself why it's
57:29 called a tank why product tank
57:31 for a specific tank no no
57:35 did you wonder
57:37 uh no but now you're asking I have to
57:40 check
57:43 are you checking right now or no no no
57:45 no but I I have to check at some time
57:47 okay yeah please share what you found
57:50 you're fine I'm really curious what like
57:52 why did you think this is a good idea I
57:54 mean probably maybe tank is not only
57:56 like you know like a tank maybe no it
57:59 probably has multiple meanings anyways
58:01 so another thing so right now uh there
58:05 was a suggestion from one of our
58:07 listeners Johanna and she suggested that
58:09 we should ask every guest to uh for some
58:13 resource recommendations
58:15 and I was wondering if there is any book
58:18 or other resource that you can recommend
58:20 to our listeners
58:23 uh considering uh we start with this
58:26 product management and data science I
58:29 really recommend one book it's like it's
58:31 called data science for business but I
58:34 just I will data science
58:37 for business
58:39 and I really recommend it for everyone
58:42 who is not it's not if you're already
58:44 against data scientist it's not the uh
58:47 the book you should read but if you're
58:49 more an experienced product manager who
58:52 tries to like who would be willing to be
58:54 a product manager or product owner of a
58:57 data product you should go for it so
59:01 it's uh called data science for business
59:05 and it's by Foster Provost and Tom
59:10 Foss set but I guess if you go like I
59:12 Googled for data science for business
59:13 the the first thing you get and it's
59:16 also what you need to know about data
59:18 mining and data analytics thinking it
59:22 sounds it really gives you a very good
59:25 um
59:26 overview of the topic what it is about
59:28 starts very Basics it explains what
59:30 predictions are and uh it's very
59:33 entertaining very easy to read
59:36 okay yeah I think it's not the first
59:39 time I hear about this book so uh but
59:42 you said it wouldn't be very interesting
59:45 for people who already know data science
59:47 for the data science it's it's more like
59:48 business people transitioning into like
59:51 towards the data science and the other
59:53 way around but I mean I don't know like
59:55 maybe someone who is in data sense and
59:58 want to understand it like how are the
1:00:00 business things it's will also help you
1:00:03 to see your kids that is the perspective
1:00:04 how it explained to them so that is
1:00:07 maybe the way I should talk to business
1:00:09 people uh that might be also helpful but
1:00:12 it's like what I like about it it's not
1:00:14 it's easy it's easy written yeah so it's
1:00:19 really not you're like not getting a
1:00:22 sleep after two pages
1:00:24 okay that's a good quality for a book
1:00:27 right
1:00:29 not a textbook okay yeah that's uh all
1:00:32 we have time for so thanks a lot Anna
1:00:34 for coming joining us sharing your
1:00:36 experience with us thanks everyone that
1:00:39 there is a lively very Lively discussion
1:00:42 and live chat so thanks for joining and
