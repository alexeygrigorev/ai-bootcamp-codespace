0:00 so like as always please subscribe to
0:02 our YouTube channel there's a bunch of
0:04 Link in the description one of them is
0:06 about the events we have we have a bunch
0:08 of interesting events check them
0:10 out and also there is a link in in the
0:14 live chat this is the link you can use
0:17 for asking questions so during the
0:19 interview we'll talk about different
0:20 things and then if you feel like asking
0:23 something it's better not to use live
0:25 chat cuz it's very hard to keep track of
0:27 questions there just use the
0:32 link and now I will open the document we
0:35 prepared for
0:37 you and if you're ready we can start yes
0:40 I'm
0:41 ready this week we'll talk about making
0:45 machine learning interpretable and we
0:47 have a very special guest today Kristoff
0:49 Kristoff has a PHD in interpretable
0:52 machine learning from the ludic maximan
0:54 University of
0:55 Mich and he worked for a while in both
0:59 Academia industry and now he is a
1:01 full-time Tech writer he has written
1:05 many technical books and if you're
1:08 watching this in video there is a
1:09 bookshelf behind Kristoff yeah with all
1:12 these four books at the top which we
1:16 will probably talk about some of them
1:18 today and yeah it's a great pleasure to
1:20 have you kristofh welcome to the show
1:23 yeah thank you for the invitation yeah
1:25 so the questions for today as always are
1:28 prepared by Johanna Johanna B thanks
1:30 youan for your help and before we start
1:33 with our main topic let's talk about
1:36 your background can you tell us about
1:38 your career Journey so far yeah um so my
1:41 background is kind of different phases
1:45 phase one was classic statistician
1:47 education I would say like Bachelor and
1:49 statistics master and
1:51 statistics um so very classic but like
1:55 hypothesis testing and stuff like this
1:58 and in the end I was already a bit drawn
2:00 to machine learning did like Tagle
2:01 competitions and stuff um and right
2:05 after I finished my master I went to
2:08 Industry so one year in fintech startup
2:10 where I worked as a data scientist two
2:13 years as more classic statistician where
2:16 I worked in medical research and during
2:19 that time I already started uh writing
2:21 the book uh interpretable machine
2:23 learning because I had like a part-time
2:25 position so uh next I just like had side
2:30 projects and one of them was the book
2:32 it's a bit ironic because after my
2:34 master thesis I really hated my master
2:36 thesis like the writing process so it's
2:38 quite ironic that I picked up writing
2:40 again then um and as I was like
2:43 different kind of writing right it's
2:45 very different yeah um I think that was
2:48 a reason why it worked for me um so when
2:52 I was writing the book I was like it
2:54 kind of took the fear out of writing for
2:56 me again because um the main reason I
2:58 also didn't do a PhD was like oh I have
3:01 to write papers I hate writing I hated
3:02 my master thesis so I should not do a
3:05 PhD but when I started a book I realized
3:08 I could you had a fear of writing yet
3:11 you thought okay let's write a book
3:14 let's see how it goes yeah yeah because
3:16 I don't know for the master thesis I was
3:19 very stressed out uh if it's it was not
3:23 only about writing I wasn't maybe it
3:25 wasn't fear of writing but I hated proc
3:29 all that right and then getting feedback
3:31 from your at least this is was
3:34 this is how it was for me like I didn't
3:38 all this experiments showing it to my
3:40 supervisor and then he would say
3:42 something doesn't seem right maybe you
3:44 need another half a
3:45 year yeah yeah and also didn't feel so
3:48 free like writing the master CES but
3:50 when I started the book I wrote it in
3:52 the open and got feedback and uh I just
3:56 could like write how I felt so like put
3:59 in some jokes and not be like not hide
4:03 behind math or anything just say like
4:05 okay this is like this use like
4:07 analogies and stuff like this so I
4:09 enjoyed this part very much um which
4:11 then led me to do a PhD uh so back to
4:14 Academia then I I again learned to hate
4:18 uh writing so I really hated uh writing
4:22 papers um but still like I finished my
4:25 PhD uh this was one year ago then I
4:29 actually
4:30 tried like a postt job for a few months
4:32 and another job in industry for a few
4:34 months and I it didn't feel right kind
4:37 of I quit both very quickly and then I
4:41 thought back like okay what what's left
4:43 what can I do because I like all these
4:45 things are now uh I quit all these
4:48 things and so I looked back and the only
4:50 constant thing was writing for me which
4:52 I always
4:54 enjoyed um and then I decided yeah why
4:57 not do this fulltime I already had my
4:59 first book so I had a little bit of
5:01 income from that book and already some
5:04 established like a reader base um and
5:07 some experience and so I jumped into
5:09 this um and I'm doing this now for a
5:12 year and half now and yeah works out so
5:16 far yeah well I know that Munich is not
5:19 the cheapest City so apparently it's
5:22 working out pretty well for you right
5:24 well I'm earning less than I did at my
5:26 PhD I usually people like climb up in
5:30 the career like in the um how much they
5:33 earn for me it was like each each career
5:35 step was a little less money which is a
5:38 bit funny but I have like so much
5:39 Freedom that I don't regret it um but
5:42 when I started I like my first job was
5:44 in Switzerland so and my second job was
5:46 part-time job so I was like a little bit
5:48 less then back to Munich little bit less
5:51 and now um with my writing again a
5:54 little bit less than a PhD um but I
5:56 think PhD fulltime PhD is not I mean you
5:58 could earn more of course now if I would
6:01 go for regular data scientist Ro um but
6:05 I enjoy the freedom a lot um that I have
6:07 now as a
6:08 rider so you can just go to one of the
6:12 lakes in the
6:13 Alps laptop yeah writing well now maybe
6:18 it's a bit cold for now for that now
6:20 right but still you can do this right if
6:22 you want it yeah and I can do like
6:24 sports in the middle of the day or start
6:26 cooking earlyer love cooking for example
6:29 and but still think sometimes I'm about
6:31 writing and it's so make progress there
6:34 at the same time so yeah do you remember
6:37 what was your first kgle
6:39 competition oh the first
6:41 [Music]
6:43 one this was during my masters and I I
6:47 didn't yet um know much machine learning
6:50 so my first models was like a linear
6:52 regression model and generalized
6:55 additive model uh I think it was
6:57 something with diabetes not not sure
7:00 entirely what the topic was um but I
7:02 remember that I was really really bad at
7:04 the competition and this was for me also
7:07 like this uh because in theory I I mean
7:10 I I knew how to model data how to build
7:12 a prediction model um but just like from
7:15 stati statistician point of view not
7:17 from a machine learning point of view so
7:19 my first thoughts were like okay this
7:21 should be like a generalized EDI of
7:22 model with these of these features I
7:24 didn't even like have a validation set
7:26 up on my side and and haven't like fully
7:30 do in statistics right
7:33 yeah okay I remember my first CLE
7:35 competition was like I did super bad
7:38 because like I thought like with all
7:39 this knowledge I have from my courses
7:42 like I would just ace it and then the
7:44 reality was the complete opposite yeah
7:47 yeah was uh quite interesting and like
7:50 how did you become interested in
7:52 interpretable machine learning is it
7:54 something you were doing during your
7:55 Masters or is it something you needed to
7:57 do at your work in your that inch
8:00 startup
8:02 or I
8:04 think for me it was quite natural I
8:08 think because as a statistician you
8:11 always you think about the data
8:13 generating process and when you build
8:15 model they are usually
8:17 interpretable and so this is the the
8:19 mindset I came from this okay let's
8:22 understand the data let's build an
8:23 understandable model and when I
8:25 transitioned more into machine learning
8:27 I this this was kind of lost
8:29 not fully because there were things like
8:31 the random Forest which which had this
8:33 built-in feature importance and stuff
8:34 like this but it felt like okay there's
8:37 parts
8:38 missing and then during my this second
8:42 job in in Switzerland I had the side
8:45 projects and and one of and this one day
8:48 off I I read the line paper which is
8:50 about this interpretability method that
8:52 fits like um linear models to explain
8:56 individual predictions of more complex
8:58 models and this was quite fascinating to
9:00 me like oh w we could have a really
9:02 complex model and then still use um or
9:06 still have a chance to understand what's
9:08 going on inside the model and then I
9:11 wanted to learn more but I couldn't
9:13 learn more because there was not so much
9:15 material online and that's was my
9:17 motivation to write a book about this
9:20 topic was quite lucky with the timing as
9:23 well because there there was no nothing
9:25 on on the market yet so like speaking of
9:28 kagle like in kagle you don't really
9:30 care about the explainability
9:34 interpretability all you care about is
9:37 predictions right you care about all
9:39 these predictions and like it doesn't
9:42 matter how exactly the model is making
9:44 these
9:44 predictions and like sometimes at works
9:47 at work is also like you have a similar
9:49 station right like turn on turn maybe
9:52 like if it's a lot of users you don't
9:54 really go and dig deeper into each
9:57 individual user when you want to
10:00 understand like why this particular
10:01 decision happened like as long as the
10:04 business metrics are satisfied like
10:06 everyone is happy like then you just you
10:08 know stuck more layers or I don't know
10:10 do something right so you don't
10:13 necessarily go and try to figure out
10:15 like for this particular customer why my
10:18 model was
10:19 wrong I imagine there are many many
10:21 cases
10:22 especially in medical research where you
10:25 have to care about
10:27 that yeah so
10:29 I I think I don't fully agree with the
10:33 kaggle case um because in kaggle of
10:35 course the what gets you the money is um
10:38 to be right with your predictions I
10:40 think interpretability can help you even
10:42 with keggle to debu a little and to this
10:46 really stupid example but I'm doing a
10:47 competition at the moment and I when I
10:50 created the features I kind of had a
10:53 Target leakage because I like a version
10:56 of my target I put into my features um
11:00 and I but I also had like
11:02 interpretability at the end of the model
11:03 like to look at the feature importances
11:05 using shop and immediately so first of
11:09 all I saw like oh the predictions go the
11:11 prediction errow is going down by a lot
11:13 was like super happy but then like a
11:16 little voice in my head said this this
11:17 is not true don't be happy there's
11:19 something wrong with your model and it
11:21 turned out to be wrong and I super
11:23 quickly found the bug because I um for
11:25 the feature importance ranking this one
11:27 feature bubbl to the top now you
11:29 wouldn't need feature importance for
11:31 this of course because you could check
11:32 your column names for example but if you
11:34 have like a large feature uh set then
11:39 it's quite tedious to look through all
11:40 of them and um for these interpretation
11:44 methods if you have such a mistake they
11:46 like Target leakage it bubbles just to
11:48 top like the the most important feature
11:51 and so I I would say interpretability
11:54 is useful for debugging your model
11:57 yeah
11:59 so you still take part in competitions
12:02 it's been some time yeah um it's my
12:04 first competition in many years um it's
12:08 not on kle it's on what is it called
12:11 Data driven I think it's for forecasting
12:15 um water um water volume Through
12:21 Rivers yeah speaking of flexibility
12:23 right so with this kind of
12:27 U I don't know can say a job but with
12:30 this sort of activity you have the
12:32 freedom of doing other things like
12:35 taking par in
12:37 competitions okay so
12:39 you realized that this is an important
12:42 topic there there is not so much there
12:45 was not so much literature information
12:49 available about that and you thought H I
12:51 don't like writing but maybe I should
12:53 try doing it one more time
12:56 right I know yeah so I I just started to
13:00 I don't know my thought process I was
13:01 just like well this would be a cool
13:03 opportunity and at this point my master
13:06 thesis was I think two two
13:09 years behind me maybe I just forgot how
13:11 it
13:12 felt um but also it was kind of stress
13:16 free because I could just Rite it was a
13:18 side project for me so no Stakes
13:20 involved at this point so I had no
13:23 pressure like okay you have to to do the
13:26 writing so well that you get your mind
13:29 degree or or to get a paper publish or
13:31 anything it was just I could just write
13:33 how how I felt it to be like the best
13:37 way and so this brought kind of the fun
13:41 back to me for like writing stuff
13:44 because I really enjoy like
13:46 understanding difficult things and
13:48 writing them down in a simpler way and
13:51 um this some yeah writing is one way how
13:54 you can express this MH so the best way
13:57 is to learn something something is to
13:59 teach something or at least write about
14:00 this way yeah a bit like this and it's
14:02 also a problem because um sometimes when
14:06 I write my newsletter or when I pick a
14:08 new book when I already know the topic I
14:11 feel like there's not so much value in
14:13 it which is obviously wrong because at
14:15 some point I didn't know these things
14:16 and I would love to would like at this
14:19 point in the past I would have loved to
14:21 read about them but for me it feels like
14:24 if it's too easy to write about it's not
14:26 worth writing about it it's it's
14:27 obviously wrong because it's if someone
14:30 else if enough other people have value
14:32 from from your writing then your writing
14:36 is valuable um so I kind of mixed it's
14:39 like easy an easy text because like when
14:42 it machine learning it's a complex thing
14:44 and if there's some resource that
14:46 explain explains complex things with
14:49 simple language then it's a good try
14:53 yeah it's good um yeah but sometimes I'm
14:55 I feel like I already understand this I
14:57 shouldn't write about it but sometimes
14:59 this maybe the most valuable thing to
15:01 write about because I already have
15:03 understood it and maybe it was hard for
15:04 me to to understand it but if I want to
15:07 write about something new I was feel
15:08 like I also have to learn it right now
15:11 but also one of the reason why I became
15:13 a writer was so I can always learn new
15:16 things uh so it's it's kind of like a
15:20 dance between these two things like it
15:22 should be like simple so I can don't
15:25 spend too much time on one thing but
15:27 also I want to about something that's
15:29 exciting for me as
15:32 well quite a book cuz like usually the
15:35 story I hear from authors and I I also
15:37 published uh book and for me it was like
15:40 first I wrote an article then like a
15:42 bunch of Articles and then I thought
15:45 okay like maybe I do something larger
15:48 but you just jumped yeah into a book
15:52 while really liking writing yeah good
15:56 question um for me
15:59 I already did some blogging before but
16:02 always quit after a few
16:04 months so but I already had a little bit
16:07 of experience with writing more freely
16:11 and with the book it was some it wasn't
16:13 like hide in my room for two years and
16:15 then finish the book and and publish it
16:18 but I published uh it as like a website
16:21 it's still uh interpretable machine
16:23 learning is still available for free and
16:25 I publish it like chapter by chapter so
16:27 it kind of like
16:30 blogging uh but of course it was it's
16:33 like a one unit um but but this allowed
16:36 me to to get feedback very early on and
16:39 to write this chapter by chapter so it
16:42 didn't feel like one huge junk like like
16:45 a huge mountain to to climb um but
16:48 Little Steps so and I think if I didn't
16:53 had hadn't gotten any feedback in the
16:55 beginning so I shared it on Twitter for
16:57 example I'm not sure if I would have
16:59 finished a
17:00 book or if it would have just been like
17:03 half a book or so or much shorter book
17:06 but also as we spoke at the beginning
17:09 briefly you didn't you don't have a
17:12 publisher you publish on your own right
17:14 and then this requires a lot of self
17:16 discipline so like if you don't publish
17:19 a chapter in a CA in a case with a
17:22 publisher publisher would chase you like
17:24 Hey where's another chapter like yeah
17:26 it's like the due date was like half a
17:28 year ago
17:29 like do something but here you have to
17:31 be chasing like if you're late you have
17:34 to like Chase yourself so you have to
17:36 have discipline yeah that see how how do
17:39 you do that like is there a secret or
17:42 you're you just so like the topic and
17:45 you so liked writing some so I'm I would
17:50 say I'm inherently motivated to do the
17:52 writing but sometimes to force myself to
17:56 like bring everything together because
17:59 um I sometimes use deadlines for myself
18:03 to Yeah because sometimes it's you feel
18:06 like okay you could write more or maybe
18:08 add another chapter um but sometimes you
18:11 just have to finish and a deadline is
18:14 then important but I I I actually was
18:18 approached by
18:20 Publishers like typical technical
18:22 Publishers and they asked me for example
18:25 hey do you want to uh publish interpret
18:28 machine learning with us um or maybe
18:30 also write a new book on topic
18:33 XYZ um and I always like research them
18:35 like how did they work and then I read
18:37 about it and I was like no that's not my
18:39 style I don't want to like have like
18:42 their strict schedule and then I heard
18:44 about like oh sometimes the editors they
18:46 have they are not so good and then I
18:49 don't get all the Roy like like a much
18:51 smaller share of the royalties and I was
18:54 like no I'll do this
18:57 myself so we already spoke about the
19:00 books you have on your bookshelf can you
19:02 tell us what these books are so I've
19:05 written four books um one of this is
19:08 interoperable machine learning which is
19:10 my first book um and there's also a
19:13 second edition
19:14 already then this this already finished
19:18 during my PhD and it's about different
19:21 it's basically each chapter has one
19:24 method that allows you to interpret your
19:25 machine learning
19:26 model and my second book this was when I
19:29 started already doing this full-time is
19:32 modeling mindsets it's a very small book
19:35 and it's also quite different from the
19:37 first one and it's about the different
19:40 ways to think about uh modeling your
19:43 data I already mentioned like how I as a
19:46 statistician participated in a kaggle
19:48 challenge and quickly you realized okay
19:50 it won't get far with the way I approach
19:52 modeling and so things like these
19:55 inspired me to write this book and my
19:58 third book is quite different it's about
20:02 um conformal prediction a method to
20:04 quantify uncertainty of your models um
20:07 so it's an introduction to this topic
20:08 and this was purely to because I wanted
20:11 to learn about the topic and um so I
20:13 wrote the book uh like an introduction
20:15 book so this was a very classic case of
20:18 learning by teaching the name of the
20:20 book is Introduction to conform the
20:21 prediction with python confounded conal
20:26 like formal like conformal yeah I don't
20:30 think I ever hear this term what does it
20:32 actually mean um conformal prediction is
20:36 about uh the basic ideas that you have
20:40 some kind of uncertainty in your model
20:43 and conforming prediction is kind of a
20:44 process so there's many different um
20:48 algorithms and they con formalize this
20:51 uncertainty measure so that you can kind
20:54 of trust your output so for example you
20:57 could
20:58 have a classifier that outputs like
21:00 class probabilities and you could use
21:03 conform prediction to say um that
21:06 instead of outputting like one class or
21:08 just the probabilities that you get a
21:10 set and with some guarantees so that's
21:12 the important part these guarantees of
21:14 probability that there's like a 95%
21:16 chance that the correct class is within
21:19 uh Within These
21:21 sets and you can use conforming
21:24 prediction also to for quanti regression
21:27 for example so that the quanti really
21:29 contain 80% of your data of your
21:32 predictions of the actual
21:35 um um outcome so we spoke about this
21:39 example of CH prediction so here uh
21:42 instead of just saying that this John do
21:44 will turn with probability 80% would
21:48 have a range an interval yeah that's
21:50 also one certain we are that this
21:53 prediction is actually correct yeah
21:55 that's also one uh method in conforming
21:58 prediction this kind of um to for for
22:02 predict for classification that you can
22:05 put like kind of bounce on a probability
22:08 that you say okay not you don't just
22:10 give one probability but a range uh
22:12 between which you
22:14 believe is it Rel to I guess there is
22:18 some relationship between interpretable
22:21 AI this uh and this topic right cuz like
22:25 to come up with this B
22:28 you kind of need to do similar things
22:31 right or am I completely wrong
22:34 um so like
22:37 technically I would say it's different
22:40 because for conform prediction you
22:43 separate your so one similar let's begin
22:47 with the
22:47 similarities um it's very it's a bit
22:50 similar to these model agnostic
22:51 interpretability techniques in so far
22:53 that you can first train your model any
22:56 model really it could be random Forest
22:58 could be neuron Network and then apply
23:00 the method afterwards because at least
23:03 for some classes of conforming
23:04 prediction which are called inductive
23:06 conform prediction um these you can
23:09 apply to your model after you've trained
23:11 it and the idea is that you have like a
23:13 calibration step so you can use some
23:16 output from a model which quantifies the
23:18 uncertainty and kind of calibrate it the
23:20 right
23:21 way um yeah but otherwise yeah that's
23:25 they the methods are completely
23:27 different right only the way you kind
23:29 apply so there's a model running in
23:30 production so you don't need to actually
23:33 you know do anything with that model you
23:35 just do something on top yeah it's at
23:38 least one possibility with um inductive
23:41 confir prediction
23:43 yeah interesting and the fourth
23:48 book uh yeah that's interpreting machine
23:50 learning models with shop so it's uh has
23:55 also python examples which my first book
23:57 doesn't have about interpretable machine
23:59 learning but otherwise it's kind of
24:00 taking one of the chapters from from
24:02 interpretable machine learning and doing
24:04 a deep dive into one of the methods
24:06 which I think is also the most uh
24:09 popular method shop and also the one of
24:13 the most versatile methods so I decided
24:16 yeah would be cool to have a book on it
24:19 this was one of the books where I was
24:20 like okay I really have a lot of
24:22 material already and I still learned ton
24:25 while writing the book because you
24:27 realize that you still have many gaps um
24:30 but still this this was where I kind of
24:33 took the stuff I already had and uh not
24:37 only learned new
24:40 things and how did you decide that uh
24:43 you want to write a book about this
24:45 particular method did you do some
24:47 research that this is the most popular
24:49 one did your readers maybe ask you for
24:52 more examples or more
24:54 Hands-On like Co with code examples or
24:57 MH like what was your process how did
25:01 you arrive at like you want to write
25:02 this particular book yeah um for shop I
25:07 already had some insights that this is
25:08 hugely popular so it was kind of a
25:11 market research because I already know
25:13 from my book uh interoperable machine
25:16 learning uh like Google analytics I know
25:19 which chapters are popular and shop and
25:22 then also have a separate Chaple values
25:24 chapter and they kind of belong together
25:26 they are by far the most popular ones so
25:29 this was um have most visits right
25:31 because you can see like how many times
25:34 each chapter was VI TR yeah and um also
25:41 I think shop is not super intuitive um I
25:44 mean there's lots of material already
25:45 like blog post and so on but I thought
25:47 that um putting this all together in a
25:49 book would be valuable to many readers
25:52 um and then I also like find shop
25:54 interesting because
25:56 it's there always this danger like you
25:58 shouldn't always only rely on one
26:00 interpretation method um I also wrote
26:03 like a blog post about it like shop is
26:04 not all you need but if someone would
26:07 force you to use only one I would use
26:09 shop um because it's very versatile and
26:12 I think there's a lot of value if you
26:14 learn
26:15 it okay well maybe we need to speak
26:18 about the this particular method but I
26:21 see that there are quite interesting
26:22 questions and the first question is from
26:25 Rona and the question is is there any
26:27 difference between explainable Ai and
26:30 interpretable AI many many people ask
26:33 this um I don't think I have a
26:34 satisfying answer um I for some some
26:38 days ago I post about like an overview
26:41 how researchers use this
26:43 differently um I think so how I use
26:46 these terms is um I use both
26:50 interpretable machine learning and
26:51 explainable AI as keywords and I think
26:56 that's most useful because there's so
26:57 much overlap so
26:59 much but there people just use both
27:03 quite
27:04 interchangeably and so if you want to
27:07 look like do a Google search on on some
27:09 topic I would always use both and I I
27:13 think I make a distinction with when I
27:15 use worbs like uh when I say um I want
27:19 to explain a prediction um some people
27:22 would criticize me now ah you don't
27:24 explain a prediction because it's a very
27:25 strong word obviously um
27:28 but I think it's still fair to use it
27:30 and if it's so this would be more for
27:32 local like understanding of the model
27:35 and for Global understanding I use mod
27:37 what
27:38 interpreting um I know that others make
27:41 the difference or distinguish between
27:44 like interpretable models and they mean
27:46 with this like that they kind of
27:48 inherently interpretable like a linear
27:50 regression model an explainable AI like
27:53 for these postto things but I don't
27:56 think that's a good like distinction
27:58 because the it's not super clear always
28:01 like the boundaries between the
28:03 two so I'm sorry but I don't think I
28:06 have a very satisfying
28:08 clean much difference and like the
28:12 question was about explainable Ai and
28:14 interpretable Ai and you correct it to
28:16 interpretable machine learning right
28:18 interet cover both yeah interpretable AI
28:21 usually used
28:22 or like this is how the term is it's
28:27 it's
28:28 ml not I'm biased because I named my
28:31 book this way so in my head it's always
28:32 interpretable ML and not AI but you can
28:36 also use this so I guess the question
28:38 boils down to like definition between
28:40 interpretable and
28:42 explainable and yeah I I I don't make a
28:46 big distinction between the
28:48 two well if you think about the words
28:51 themselves like what's the difference
28:53 between explain and interpret yeah
28:56 interet like you kind of interpret it
28:57 and you don't necessarily explain it to
28:59 others yeah for me I understand how it
29:02 works explainable for me is a very
29:04 strong word I think that was also like
29:07 why like said interpretable machine
29:09 learning when I named my book um but I
29:13 named it quite early on so a lot of
29:15 things happened afterwards and the term
29:18 explainable AI got quite famous as well
29:21 and at some point it actually was named
29:23 explainable AI my book um but then I
29:26 decided against it and now it's
29:28 interoperable machine learning um I
29:30 think I like interoperability a little
29:32 bit more because explainability is very
29:35 strong um because if you can explain
29:37 something you have deeply understood it
29:40 but interpretation is like okay you see
29:42 something and you have an interpretation
29:45 because you don't like fully understand
29:47 it but just parts and kind of derive
29:50 with your like insights which is an
29:52 interpretation of what you see so that's
29:54 why I like the term more more
30:00 okay and now you work as a technical
30:04 book writer yeah you said for a year
30:08 right you have been doing
30:10 this do you feel lonely when you just
30:13 write
30:14 but alone do you miss
30:17 colleagues sometimes yes um I so I like
30:21 working by myself a
30:22 lot
30:24 um um but sometimes I'm like
30:27 I would be nice to like work in a team
30:30 for a day or so the problem is you can't
30:33 do this really on and off I mean you can
30:35 but then you're like tied to what
30:37 project and yeah I just would like to
30:41 have this like each other day like some
30:44 someday um I mean it's not fully lonely
30:47 I me I'm talking to you right now for
30:48 example U so you can do other things
30:51 like podcasts and and talk to people
30:54 also I I'm writing a book at the moment
30:57 with team with rle who's a former
30:59 colleague of mine and so we write this
31:02 book together it's my first
31:03 collaborative book um so I also have
31:07 like a we're a little team right now at
31:09 least for this one project so there's
31:11 some it's not only me sitting alone in
31:14 in my room and tinkering and
31:17 writing I guess writing with somebody
31:20 else not only makes the process not only
31:24 makes it like kind of forces you to
31:27 earlier CU like half of the content is
31:31 written by you half of the content is
31:33 written by your co-author and then you
31:35 review each other so you kind of deliver
31:37 the book P right
31:40 um it's I would say it's slower because
31:44 my co-author he's has like a full-time
31:46 job uh like he's a post so he can
31:50 dedicate as much time as I could so if I
31:52 would write it alone I might be F I
31:54 think I would be faster um but it's it's
31:57 fine the way it is um because I think
31:59 it's a it's so the topic is supervised
32:02 machine learning and science it's about
32:05 how supervised machine learning is is
32:07 used like for doing research and stuff
32:09 um so kind of Applied machine learning
32:12 um and the book has two parts it's about
32:14 like justification of why it's okay to
32:15 do it or whether it's okay to use
32:17 machine learning um because there's some
32:19 problems of course with you don't
32:21 understand uh fully understand the model
32:24 and so on but also like puzzle pieces
32:26 that if you use machine learning in
32:27 science or in research like what do you
32:30 actually need to make it work because if
32:31 you just use it like as a keggle
32:33 competition then there's lots of missing
32:35 pieces you like causality
32:37 interpretability uncertainty
32:39 quantification so we're kind of putting
32:41 this together
32:43 and I think it's good that we take the
32:45 time to write this um so we kind of have
32:48 a half draft now um because but we take
32:52 we're taking our time to really think
32:53 this through um because it's a yeah I
32:56 think a bit new topic and also
32:59 philosophical component to
33:02 it yeah so that's a I think it's a fun
33:05 project okay so you said you would write
33:08 it faster because like your co-author
33:11 has other
33:13 commitments so then you also don't
33:15 invest as much time as you could
33:17 potentially cuz like you
33:19 probably so what I'm trying to say you
33:22 probably have still time right so are
33:24 you working on something else in the
33:26 meantime M so right now I'm
33:28 participating in a challenge uh like not
33:32 on kle but another platform driven data
33:34 right this one yeah that you mentioned
33:37 yeah
33:38 and almost fulltime at the moment like
33:41 since a week or so uh but yeah but
33:44 that's the first time I'm doing this
33:45 since I'm writing but I felt like I need
33:48 I need a Hands-On project again because
33:51 sometimes can feel like this like like
33:54 like a disconnect if you always write
33:56 about using much machine learning and so
33:57 on and I I do have lots of experience
34:00 from earlier on but like last one and a
34:03 half years I've only been writing and no
34:05 doing no data analysis really and then
34:08 feels like a bit out of touch maybe and
34:10 so it was really good to do still feels
34:13 really good to do like a Hands-On
34:14 project with all like the problems with
34:16 the data and how to model it and so on
34:20 yeah that's nice that you brought this
34:21 up cuz uh I also I used to work as a
34:26 data scientist for time now I
34:28 don't and what I'm afraid of is like
34:31 I'll lose this touch with reality
34:34 because if somebody asks me I don't know
34:38 about something something then my answer
34:40 would be based on my experience that I
34:43 got at work right and I'm no longer
34:46 working so this answer might be outdated
34:49 and the more I know the longer I don't
34:52 work as a data scientist the more
34:54 outdated the answers my answers become
34:56 right MH how do I
34:59 stay hands on yeah this is what you do
35:02 right so you take part in
35:04 competitions and you make sure that the
35:07 methods you teach the things you're
35:08 write about they're still applicable
35:10 because you can try them in this real
35:12 life projects right yeah yeah but but I
35:16 feel like it's it's I didn't expect this
35:18 but that the writing helps me to be
35:20 better in a
35:22 competition and it's because I'm now
35:24 much more structured and I actually have
35:26 like a little log book and I write about
35:29 okay when I'm stuck for example or when
35:31 I have like a breakthrough and it's kind
35:34 of it I didn't expect this but it helps
35:36 me a lot to like keep my thoughts in
35:39 order because in a machine learning
35:41 competition you have so many like
35:43 directions that you could follow and
35:46 very often you try something and it
35:48 doesn't work and usually you get very I
35:51 still get frustrated when it happens
35:53 especially if you invest a whole day but
35:55 if you can write it down you can process
35:56 it I think much faster be like yeah this
35:59 was an experiment experiment showed uh
36:02 for example this weather data didn't
36:04 help anything with the prediction or
36:05 improving the performance so I move on
36:07 to the next experiment and to keep like
36:11 to keep myself focused on what I'm doing
36:14 it helps me so much like that I'm more
36:17 um have this habit of
36:19 writing this is so
36:22 cooled yeah I want to learn more like
36:25 how do you exactly structure this what
36:26 kind of tools do you use like is it just
36:28 Google doc or something you mean
36:31 especially for this competition now or
36:33 yeah for this competition in general
36:34 like let's say I take part in a
36:36 competition and they want to follow your
36:38 approach I want to have this log book
36:40 how should I do that it's extremely
36:43 messy so um and it's I'm doing this the
36:46 first time and kind of works but it's
36:48 not like I have like a fully flashed up
36:49 process how I do this so it's not like
36:51 you finish the competition and you have
36:53 a book that you can publish right yeah I
36:56 actually thought about because there's
36:57 um there's a communication so there's
36:59 there's price money involved in this
37:02 project and in this competition mostly
37:04 of course if you're like
37:05 performance-based but there's also like
37:07 a competition part or like a price part
37:10 about explainability and communication I
37:13 see why you take part in that
37:15 competition yeah that was a bonus yeah
37:17 and also the topic was interesting to me
37:19 so it's about predicting the water flow
37:21 in rivers and I like all these ecology
37:24 uh data tasks um
37:27 yeah so one thought that I have is that
37:30 I could also use them this journey to
37:34 kind of write a narrative how I approach
37:36 the entire challenge so I try to write
37:39 down every day where I work on a
37:41 challenge like a few thoughts at
37:43 least is it like a diary uh diary how do
37:47 I say it like is it like a journal that
37:50 each time before going to bed you open
37:53 right dear diary to dat this what I
37:55 tried yeah it's a bit like this so I
37:57 have I use obsidian electronic right I
38:00 assume not like paper it's yeah it's
38:04 just very messy so the idea is that it
38:06 shouldn't
38:07 be it it shouldn't take a lot of effort
38:10 to do it so I write very hly very just
38:13 short sentences and yeah just uh bullet
38:16 points and I use as a not taking tool
38:19 obsidian so also for other things and I
38:22 just have like for this this challenge I
38:25 have no one file and I just put dump
38:27 every thoughts in there and also this
38:30 logbook with what I
38:32 do and yeah but this helps me like keep
38:35 focused on a
38:37 project and I guess like these buet
38:39 points in case you want to go back to
38:42 them and turn them into a proper text
38:46 yeah that's one reason the information
38:47 there right yeah one reason is that I
38:50 just have this because I wouldn't
38:51 remember like oh dat seven I struggle to
38:55 make a good submission or whatever
38:57 and the other reason is because just
38:59 writing itself even if I don't ever look
39:00 at it again if I don't ever touch it
39:02 again it helps me to like to put into
39:06 words or to summarize what I did the
39:08 entire day because it's super
39:10 frustrating if you just don't think
39:13 about what you did all day um but if you
39:15 write it down like two sentences okay
39:17 today I finished this part and I
39:20 realized that using weather data doesn't
39:22 help then it's already it helps me to to
39:26 keep f focused on what I do the next day
39:28 and to not get frustrated that maybe I
39:30 didn't make as much progress because
39:32 often you do more than you think like
39:35 because you tried many things well at
39:37 least that's how I feel them so yeah
39:40 because I was going to ask why would
39:44 somebody even do that like why would
39:46 somebody even write it on day seven I
39:47 struggle to make a submission CU like
39:50 it's not useful but when you say that
39:52 put things in perspective like it's not
39:55 like on day seven you and didn't do
39:57 anything yeah exactly something except
40:00 like there were some problems and you
40:02 needed to work on solving these problems
40:04 and now you know that okay like yeah I
40:06 actually worked on something yeah
40:08 sometimes motivated right yeah and it's
40:11 hard to put into words but sometimes I I
40:13 um struggle with something but I don't
40:16 like formulate in my head what the
40:17 problem is and then sometimes I get
40:20 distracted and go to Twitter or do
40:22 something else and but writing down what
40:24 like what's the essence of my problem
40:26 for example uh in this particular
40:29 challenge the the problem or the the
40:32 goal is to predict the volume in a
40:34 season so that's the total volume over a
40:38 few months but you have to make the
40:39 predictions at different time points in
40:42 time and some points or some dates are
40:46 actually already within the season so
40:48 you have some partial data or some
40:50 partial water flow already and I really
40:55 struggled how to put this this into my
40:57 model how you like this knowledge
40:59 because obviously if you already know
41:01 that some amount is already through like
41:03 has flown through the river then you can
41:05 adapt your prediction and then this was
41:09 kind of my problem I was thinking about
41:11 for a few days actually and uh but this
41:14 helped me to put this into writing like
41:16 hey this is like what I have to achieve
41:17 this is the problem I have to solve the
41:19 most important one um
41:21 yeah it's
41:24 a almost like psychologic maybe to like
41:28 like a mental process to to help to
41:31 focus how much time do you spent on this
41:33 log
41:34 book very little very little it's maybe
41:39 yeah so in the beginning I was just
41:40 writing down okay this is the so I also
41:44 have like Parts okay to understand
41:45 evalation matric I just like put all the
41:47 information in and things like okay
41:50 these are the data side like the
41:53 problems about the data I put have one
41:55 section so in beginning I spent maybe a
41:57 little more but this was like while I
41:59 was reading the description of the
42:00 challenge I put in some like I
42:02 summarized the most important parts for
42:04 me so there maybe I don't know one or
42:06 two hours and now I just like five or 10
42:09 minutes a day I just it's very short I
42:11 just say a few lines like what I did
42:13 today and yeah it's like diary except
42:16 it's for the competition that's for the
42:18 competition
42:19 yeah okay uh there's a question I really
42:22 like and I think we talked about that
42:24 the question is do you have to be an
42:27 expert in the field to start writing
42:29 about
42:31 it and it
42:33 helps or maybe it doesn't maybe it
42:35 doesn't
42:37 um I can see why it's not always you can
42:41 make the argument both ways so if you're
42:43 not an expert then you have the same
42:45 obstacles as your future
42:47 readers that means when you write a book
42:50 you
42:51 can like write about these obstacles so
42:54 these misunderstandings that you have in
42:56 the beginning about the technique you're
42:58 writing about or the the algorithms
43:00 you're writing about um but it will also
43:03 be very tough process maybe for you
43:05 because you have to learn and write at
43:07 the same time and you also need to make
43:09 sure that what you write about is
43:11 actually correct right exactly yeah
43:13 that's it's like you misunderstood
43:15 something but you thought like this is
43:16 the right way and you right about this
43:18 and then like half a year later it turns
43:20 out that it's not and you have to redo
43:22 like the whole thing yeah and it's also
43:24 a question if you already know something
43:26 so let's say you would write want to
43:29 write a book about machine learning but
43:30 you don't have like the basics in so for
43:32 me it
43:33 would uh going into machine learning for
43:36 example was for me much easier because I
43:38 studied statistics so a lot of the math
43:40 behind the machine learning and uh
43:44 working with data was already I already
43:47 knew so you should also think about like
43:50 where where do you start from so for
43:52 example confirming prediction for me was
43:54 new the topic itself but of of course
43:56 many of the concepts I already knew um
43:59 even if I didn't know conform prediction
44:01 before so I would
44:04 say if the best the very best thing
44:07 would be if you're an
44:09 expert but you still remember all your
44:12 struggles anding go down to the level of
44:15 the reader right so for you it can be
44:18 like so for example cross validation for
44:20 you it's just like you wake up in the
44:21 middle of the night your eyes are
44:24 blindfolded and you do cross validation
44:26 right yeah somebody who is new to that
44:29 might not even understand important
44:31 thing and how it works and why we need
44:33 it right and what are the goes so if you
44:36 keep like a lock book when learning then
44:38 you could also remember your
44:42 struggles yeah so I think this would be
44:44 the ideal setup being an expert but
44:47 still remembering what it was to be a
44:50 beginner having a beginner who you can
44:53 experiment with your
44:54 things I would say hey like I don't
44:57 understand this thing you can see where
44:59 they struggle right mhm this is I think
45:02 this is what you do with your book to at
45:05 least we talked about uh that for your
45:08 first book cuz you wrote in the open so
45:10 everyone could see and comment and say
45:12 where they don't understand right so
45:14 then you could take this feedback and
45:16 incorporate it into the book right do
45:19 you still write in the
45:21 open
45:22 um I have
45:24 so quite different between the books I
45:27 would say uh so the first book was fully
45:29 open and I wrote a chapter by chapter
45:32 and the next book were closed um so like
45:36 most of the books I guess um but I did
45:39 have so for for modeling mindsets I
45:41 asked like friends and and colleagues to
45:43 to read individual
45:45 chapters and then later on for
45:48 conforming prediction book and Sh book I
45:50 actually asked um readers to be if they
45:54 want to be um test readers and this work
45:56 quite well so this because then I
45:59 already
46:00 got so you have you have a newsletter
46:03 right so then the newsletter you can
46:04 write hey like I'm writing a book about
46:07 that do you want to be better users or
46:09 test readers right exactly and then
46:12 people say hey yes and then I um kind of
46:15 share a um Google Drive version of the
46:18 book and then got so far this work
46:21 really really well so I got extremely
46:24 good feedback from from through this
46:26 process I'm very grateful to everyone
46:28 who reads my book before they are
46:30 finished um so this this work quite well
46:33 for
46:35 me can it be problematic if you have
46:37 like too much feedback like too many
46:40 people want to read your books I once
46:42 had this problem with the shopbook that
46:44 I invited a lot of um bet readers um I
46:48 think one problem is of course if if you
46:50 have a very problematic part like then
46:53 all the readers will comment on this
46:54 part and then it's like
46:56 also kind of a not so good that you give
46:59 this version to so a lot of people so I
47:02 one lesson for me was to keep the list
47:04 of readers um not like small um and so
47:10 it's you shouldn't have too many
47:11 batteries I think and rather you should
47:13 have more phases where you like invite a
47:16 few readers and incorporate the feedback
47:19 have a new version have new readers for
47:22 for this new version and that's what
47:24 worked best for me so far but of course
47:27 it prolongs the process of uh how long
47:30 it takes until you can
47:32 publish was also like if you don't agree
47:34 with the feedback like what do you
47:36 do if you don't agree you don't have to
47:39 use it I mean that's that's the nature
47:40 of feedback then like the person might
47:43 feel offended and okay like he doesn't
47:45 want to listen to my feedback what I'm
47:47 doing here didn't have this case so far
47:51 um I think it should always like double
47:53 check the feedback like in sense of like
47:55 maybe I'm wrong so I should I always
47:58 come from this angle probably I'm wrong
48:00 because uh the
48:03 reader the reader so the end I'm writing
48:05 for the
48:06 reader but sometimes you can also have
48:08 the case that this this I already had
48:11 that like one reader says hey um you
48:14 should have this a simple example in the
48:16 beginning and the other reader says hey
48:18 why is there an example already I
48:20 haven't really understood what the
48:21 method is about so this should be later
48:24 in in the chapter so there's
48:26 there can be like different tastes or
48:29 different opinions also and this you
48:32 just have to make the decision what you
48:33 think is best
48:35 then and probably like what is what
48:37 feels more natural to you
48:39 personally see then another question I
48:42 really like is do you have any advice
48:45 for somebody who is looking to start
48:47 their Journey as a technical
48:51 author yeah don't start with a book um
48:55 no that's yeah no actually it's what I
48:57 did but um I would say start with small
49:01 units so this could be
49:03 posts
49:05 um yeah like a blog post or maybe even
49:08 smaller like on social media LinkedIn
49:10 Twitter muston whatever and start just
49:13 start writing um obviously okay in for
49:17 post you can that's just start writing
49:21 kind
49:23 of yeah because I think the biggest
49:25 issue is that if you're write but never
49:28 publish this is frustrating you don't
49:30 get feedback and the worst that it I
49:32 think the worst that you can happen is
49:34 if you publish that nobody will read it
49:37 and but that's Al but that's the case if
49:39 you never publish then nobody will will
49:41 read it for sure um because
49:44 when yeah I mean you can do writing for
49:46 yourself but then it's more like a diary
49:48 or something um but I think just getting
49:51 started is the most important it sounds
49:53 so like that D but yeah make it small
49:57 and publish it mhm but maybe also the
50:01 question is like how can I be a fulltime
50:04 technical author like what are my
50:07 steps yeah I don't know I haven't
50:09 studied many people who do this
50:10 full-time uh actually I think most
50:13 people are just doing this like at the
50:15 side maybe they have a successful Cod
50:17 and they write one book or two at on the
50:20 side
50:22 um I
50:24 think the
50:26 like public like write technical writing
50:29 is
50:30 something I wouldn't recommend it like
50:32 if you haven't done anything like this
50:34 before to to just quit your job and
50:35 start it I think that's a bad idea uh
50:37 because this something you can actually
50:39 like build up right if you haven't done
50:42 something like don't quit your job and
50:43 start I mean if you have enough
50:45 financial security right go for it but
50:48 the thing is if you if you have a job
50:51 until today and tomorrow you say Okay I
50:54 I start technically writing even if
50:55 you're good at it and even if you're
50:56 fast your first income will come a few
50:59 months later many months later actually
51:01 because first you have to write a book
51:03 you have to publish it and even after
51:05 publishing it you have to wait like two
51:07 months before and even if you make sales
51:09 on day one you have to wait two months
51:11 until you get the money from from how
51:13 much time it takes to write a book
51:16 that's really difficult to say um I
51:18 would say at least a few months um it
51:21 can take many years depending on how
51:23 much time you spend with the book and
51:25 how many people are involved and like if
51:28 there's a long like editorial process
51:31 behind it um for me I would say like
51:34 half a year or
51:36 so okay but half a year of working and
51:39 then like after that after you publish
51:42 maybe in a three in maybe in three
51:44 months you'll start but also not
51:46 full-time working because I think you
51:48 can work work fulltime on a book there
51:50 yeah I mean I can't write eight hours a
51:52 day you just go yeah you go czy C and
51:57 yeah so I do a lot of other things like
52:00 now the challenge obviously um but also
52:02 like uh posting on social media
52:04 newsletter writing and these are things
52:07 if you want to be self-published and you
52:09 also need some means of uh distribution
52:12 and reaching people even if you're not a
52:15 self-publisher you often have to do your
52:16 marketing
52:18 yourself yeah so like I published a book
52:21 with Ming it took two
52:23 years and then it feels like
52:25 I might be wrong but it feels like they
52:27 just want me to do all the marketing yes
52:29 yeah why do I need you guys right
52:33 yeah yeah that's something I didn't
52:35 expect in the beginning also I I
52:37 researched this a lot I think it might
52:40 help if you have a name tag on it like
52:42 from a bigger publisher and then it's in
52:44 their Library kind of in their in their
52:46 shop and because of the stamp of the
52:50 publish it I think it can help because
52:52 for me people just have to trust like in
52:54 in me kind of because there was no
52:57 publish saying okay you do this by
53:00 already like
53:01 having audience followers right so you
53:04 from the beginning you said you were
53:06 writing in the open so people could
53:09 follow you and could see what you write
53:11 about
53:13 already you already got some trust from
53:15 them right and then by the moment you
53:17 finish the book they thought okay like
53:18 this is such a cool book and we know
53:20 Kristoff so we want to buy from him yeah
53:23 yeah I think this helped immens because
53:25 I mean I didn't have any credibility in
53:28 the beginning and but I wrote the book
53:30 in the open so people just could see the
53:32 book and later on decide whether they
53:35 want to buy it and paperback form for
53:38 example so there was not they didn't
53:40 have like this there was no big trust
53:43 issue or anything because they could
53:46 just read it
53:48 beforehand and what do you use for
53:51 publishing cuz like you also have
53:53 physical copies I know that there
53:56 websites where you can sell like digital
53:59 products PDFs videos whatever but like
54:02 you have physical books yeah so yeah one
54:06 first part is uh where I sell is on
54:08 leanpub which is the PDF and ebooks and
54:12 this like just a digital book store um
54:15 then there's print on demand Services
54:17 where you basically also upload a PDF
54:20 file a cover file and put on all the
54:22 details and then you can Sol publish
54:24 there so um do they also handle the
54:28 logistics not at all so or they send
54:30 like you they send you a truck with
54:33 books no they offload it in your yard
54:36 and then you do whatever you want with
54:37 this no that's uh fortunately not the
54:40 way I mean you could do it this way it
54:41 would be much more complicated and I
54:43 would have to do all the the packaging
54:45 and sending out books and I I guess I
54:47 would earn more percentage per book
54:51 um have life yeah just do this all the
54:54 time
54:56 yeah I'm using Amazon KDP but there are
54:58 others as well so that's kind of a
55:01 printer on demand service so you upload
55:03 your book there and they sell it for you
55:06 and if you buy a book of mine then uh
55:10 they will just print it and send it to
55:12 you so there's no no pre-printing like
55:16 or having like a my garage full of books
55:19 involved MH so the book when you do it
55:22 through Amazon the book appears in all
55:24 Amazon stores right right in the US in
55:26 Germany like in
55:28 France MH that's cool yeah you can
55:31 actually pick like the marketplaces
55:32 where you wanted to appear and you can
55:34 even like uh pick expanded distribution
55:38 so it gets to the other bookstores as
55:39 well the bigger ones at least um like B
55:42 and mobbles and
55:43 stuff oh okay like even that so like
55:46 even in uh people can see your books in
55:49 a bookstore yeah so it's a good time to
55:51 be a self-publisher because there's lots
55:53 of these platforms and tools to
55:55 available yeah so I actually had some
55:58 doubts whether it's a smart choice
56:00 because of like jgpt and stuff when it
56:02 came out but I'm more relaxed now I mean
56:04 there lots of books which
56:06 are uh autogenerated by large language
56:10 models yeah but I I still say it's a
56:12 good time to be a
56:15 writer interesting so you said that
56:18 people can find your books on linp and
56:20 Amazon but they have like a homepage
56:23 with all the books and links and all
56:24 that
56:25 yeah my uh kristofh m.com
56:29 christopher.com
56:30 books it's just a list of my books yeah
56:34 probably it's a good idea to follow you
56:35 on LinkedIn and Twitter right yeah it's
56:38 always a good idea of
56:40 course anything else you wanted to
56:42 mention but we forgot to talk
56:44 about um no just U I had a lot of fun
56:48 talking with you I think was a very nice
56:50 uh
56:51 conversation yeah yeah thanks yeah
