0:00 hi everyone Welcome to our event this
0:02 event is brought to you by data talks
0:04 club which is a community of people who
0:06 love data we have weekly events and this
0:08 is one of such events if you want to
0:10 find out more about the events we have
0:12 there is a link in the description go
0:14 there click on this link and you'll see
0:16 all the events we have on our schedule
0:19 then if you haven't subscribed to our
0:21 YouTube channel do it now you will not
0:23 regret we have a lot of amazing videos
0:25 and you will not miss any of them if you
0:27 subscribe
0:28 and finally last but not least don't
0:31 forget that we have an amazing slack
0:33 Community if for some reasons you're not
0:35 there yet you're missing out
0:37 joined to hang out with other data
0:39 enthusias the link is also in the
0:41 description during today's interview you
0:43 can ask any question you want there is a
0:45 pinned Link in the live chat please ask
0:48 please use this link and I'll be
0:50 covering these questions during
0:51 interview also you might notice that
0:54 there is a poll right now in in the live
0:57 chat which asks what's your role so
1:00 please take a moment to answer this
1:02 question because now I will stop sharing
1:06 my screen
1:07 and what I will do is I will stop the
1:11 pole
1:12 because I actually do this
1:16 okay I'm trying to figure out the
1:18 interface and Paul we broke we broke
1:21 your workflow
1:23 yeah don't do this often
1:26 so we have 21 vote so engineer
1:29 scientists the individual contributor is
1:32 85 not working yet nine percent manager
1:36 four percent and director is how many do
1:39 you think
1:41 zero
1:46 zero all right yeah so I guess I guess
1:48 this would be very very helpful uh you
1:50 know I mean I you know with my team I
1:53 always like to
1:54 uh even with with the individual
1:57 contributors uh you know every time we
1:59 we we we speak and and you know do our
2:02 sessions kind of give an Outlook of what
2:05 uh you know your job could look like uh
2:08 as you progress as you grow as you as
2:10 it's going to be the next next and and
2:12 really understand how organizations work
2:14 and I think that could could be helpful
2:17 for everybody even in individual
2:19 contributor role
2:22 I can't so to the start
2:27 okay let's let's roll
2:29 so this week we'll talk about building
2:31 data science practice and we have a
2:33 special guest today Andrei Andrei is a
2:35 director of engineering at Honeywell
2:37 where he leads the Advanced Technology
2:39 Group within the safety and sensing
2:41 business he is working on developing
2:43 Technologies and solution based on
2:45 Signal processing perception computer
2:47 vision AI machine learning for
2:49 healthcare industrial logistical Market
2:52 protocols so that's uh you're doing
2:54 quite a lot of work and you've been with
2:57 Honeywell for five years right and Andre
3:02 also leaves his wife and son in Dallas
3:05 Texas so it's pleasure to have you here
3:08 Andre
3:10 thanks Alex say it's uh it's a pleasure
3:12 to be here I hope people will have a
3:14 great session here
3:16 yeah we definitely will before we go
3:18 into our main topic of building data
3:21 science practice let's start with your
3:22 background can you tell us about your
3:24 career Journey so far
3:26 sure
3:27 um so like you say
3:29 um I'm director of engineering Honeywell
3:32 um I live lead with and support with
3:34 what's called Advanced Technology Group
3:36 which is uh sort of like a composition
3:38 of uh several teams we are working on
3:42 novel technologies that we later
3:45 introduce into our uh product line so we
3:49 work with a lot of signal processing
3:51 like a cell perception
3:54 um vision and
3:57 across in the last five years I worked
3:59 across multiple Sports multiple
4:01 organizations I came
4:03 uh to lead our AI adoption initiative
4:08 and later transferred to build our
4:11 robotics group were a LED our perception
4:14 team uh for for a year
4:17 so it's been it's been a good journey of
4:18 uh working through you know multiple
4:21 Advanced uh teams and building maturity
4:24 and building practice into those teams
4:26 in terms of my career you know I've been
4:29 coding since I remember myself probably
4:31 seven seven years old
4:33 and I've been I've been always uh you
4:36 know kind of engineer at my heart but my
4:38 formal background is actually not the
4:40 computer science my formal background is
4:42 organizational development Management in
4:45 the context of I.T and Technology
4:47 organizations I have a scholarship and
4:51 multiple um multiple degrees in
4:55 organizational development and
4:56 management
4:58 um overall Mike I started as a software
5:00 engineer
5:02 uh and uh I used uh you know I I I I
5:06 saved my paycheck on the site to to fund
5:10 uh a few businesses
5:12 uh some of them that I successfully
5:15 failed and some of them I uh some of
5:17 them were later Acquired and during one
5:20 of those uh businesses so I were I was I
5:23 was there as a technical co-founder
5:26 um we did that that business was around
5:28 they were actually scanning and
5:30 digitizing retailer catalogs for coupons
5:34 uh it was back in Europe and we were
5:37 essentially scanning those coupon uh
5:40 printed paper catalogs and we were
5:42 extracting the information from those
5:44 catalogs and we were kind of um offering
5:47 that on our website and that required a
5:49 lot of uh you know first of all image
5:51 image analysis and also um sort of
5:53 recommendation models and this is where
5:55 I you know that was 2014 2013-14 this is
6:00 where I fell in love with with data with
6:03 data science
6:05 and uh starting then this is where
6:09 um I I really started my journey with
6:11 with data science uh with conventional
6:13 data science data analytics and then
6:15 later into the neural networks of course
6:18 and that led me it was interesting
6:21 because uh you know after I had my own
6:24 uh sort of set of businesses I went to
6:27 another extreme I went to Honeywell and
6:29 Honeywell
6:30 um you know in in Europe and the Middle
6:33 East it's it might not be as
6:35 as as well known in in U.S it's
6:38 Honeywell is a Fortune 100 company with
6:41 a 100 year old history and Heritage uh
6:45 being known for mostly before it was
6:49 well known mostly for industrial
6:52 hardware industrial equipment
6:54 and some of you might ask you know what
6:57 what brought you from you know doing
6:59 your own startups into you know a
7:02 multinational conglomerate with hundred
7:05 thousand people but I joined Hannibal
7:07 five years ago when um so the company
7:10 got its uh new CEO who put a company on
7:15 the trajectory of digital transformation
7:18 it's it's really what it meant uh you
7:20 know from a moving company from being
7:23 Hardware oriented into more software
7:26 industrial oriented essentially changing
7:29 our model from selling one-time Hardware
7:33 to selling services and subscription
7:35 that is enabled by by that hardware and
7:38 that meant really you know sensorizing
7:42 connecting all of that equipment pushing
7:45 data into the cloud and doing a lot of
7:47 analytics doing a lot of signal process
7:49 and doing a lot of intelligence in the
7:51 cloud that you can actually multiply the
7:54 the the value of those Solutions and
7:56 that really sold me on that I realized
7:58 that would be a lot of uh a lot of scope
8:01 of doing analytics doing Ai and we could
8:05 be really at the at the beginning of it
8:08 and so that that that really sold me it
8:10 sold me on on my role and it's just uh
8:13 you know everything that we work here is
8:15 is really high impact you are in your
8:18 day your everyday job impacted millions
8:20 of of of
8:22 customers and so I work with
8:25 over my last five years I've worked in
8:27 you know with the logistics uh Warehouse
8:30 robotics I work with smart cameras or
8:34 some cool Technologies for for sensing
8:37 and most of uh what we do is uh is
8:41 vision and perception
8:43 but we also worked into other modalities
8:47 like natural language and voice and and
8:50 Predictive Analytics overall
8:54 so I'm just wondering what kind of
8:56 industrial equipment uh do you work with
8:59 is it like conveyor belts or things like
9:02 that so this is one and yeah this is one
9:04 of one of the one of the product lines
9:06 and animal is a really distributed
9:08 organization you can think of it's
9:10 really it's actually like you know a
9:12 Russian doll where you have like things
9:14 like you have five big business groups
9:16 at the top airspace smart connection
9:19 space performance materials
9:22 Safety Products uh our own cloud
9:25 platforms so it's really it's it's five
9:27 big companies with an umbrella one
9:30 company and then each of those companies
9:32 they split into their own businesses and
9:34 units and it's a very complex structure
9:36 of you know businesses and uh and part
9:39 follows that you that you need to
9:40 navigate
9:42 that's a very interesting name I was I
9:45 would assume if that they do like
9:47 cereals breakfast uh because the name is
9:50 you know tasty
9:55 but uh in U.S a company known well known
9:59 for well you know every every building
10:01 mostly you know almost every building
10:03 has some sort of Animal product every
10:06 commercial building I bought a house
10:08 last last year I found a gas meter from
10:11 Honeywell and the the honeymoon
10:14 thermostat so
10:16 um like when when I try to sell
10:18 Honeywell to the engineers and managers
10:22 that I hire I usually talk about that
10:24 which is true that essentially you know
10:27 anywhere you go any building the
10:29 airplane car you would find even you
10:33 know space shuttles you would find
10:35 something something from Carnival
10:38 and you develop some things for for this
10:41 gas meters for things on airplanes or or
10:46 only like I guess for these assembly
10:48 lines right your uh that's why I work I
10:52 work uh in the business Group which is
10:54 called the safety and productivity
10:55 Solutions and there are things like
10:57 again smart cameras smart sensors
10:59 robotics for warehouses uh you go to
11:03 Starbucks or you go to IKEA you would
11:05 see at the at the
11:07 um at the uh the the barcode scanner at
11:10 the at the post terminal would be will
11:12 be from from Honeywell so it's really
11:14 you know in your daily you you won't
11:17 notice it but but really you touch
11:19 Animal product on a daily basis
11:21 yeah quite interesting okay I know
11:25 nothing about this company until now so
11:27 that's uh we are doing quite a lot of
11:29 interesting stuff
11:31 and
11:32 um
11:33 yeah so the topic today is building data
11:36 science practice but I was wondering so
11:39 what does actually what does it actually
11:41 mean data science practice is it a data
11:44 science team or there is more to that
11:48 well when when when I think about
11:50 practice it's I think about sort of like
11:53 a widespread adoption of
11:56 best data science and machine learning
11:58 engineering practices
12:00 across the organization
12:02 and it might not seem something special
12:06 in the context of you know small
12:08 organizations where you have you know
12:09 just one product team but when you think
12:11 about
12:12 multi-product team organizations
12:14 organizations that are distributed
12:18 um it's not a straightforward thing to
12:21 to to make data science work efficiently
12:25 and really you know it's about breaking
12:30 organizational barriers uh not allowing
12:33 for Silas you don't really have a way to
12:37 um you know if you want really to you
12:39 you your your data science strategy run
12:42 efficiently especially in the very
12:43 beginning you won't you don't you cannot
12:46 allow for teams uh using multiple
12:48 Frameworks or using multiple tools or
12:51 using multiple
12:52 um clouds and uh
12:55 really it's that that makes things in
12:58 inefficient and so this is what I think
13:01 when I talk about data science practices
13:03 all is it's aligning everybody
13:07 um on on the same page so teams work not
13:11 only efficiently within the team context
13:13 but also within a with an organizational
13:15 with an organizational context and
13:19 yeah so it's it's just a maturing up the
13:22 organization and to shift
13:24 you know from ad hoc like pilot uh where
13:28 you you know teams constantly are
13:31 building pilots pilots pilots but they
13:33 don't push those Pilots into production
13:34 and that's how to how to shift uh from
13:38 uh from the sort of uh constant pilot
13:40 stage to mature stage when you ship and
13:43 a new productize
13:46 and then wondering in your particular
13:48 case at Honeywell so Honeywell to me
13:50 strikes uh which tracks me as a more
13:53 like traditional company where it comes
13:57 second AI comes second while there are
14:00 companies like um
14:01 like internet companies where it's much
14:04 much easier right to get data and start
14:06 using machine learning like for you I
14:10 guess that was an extra
14:12 layer of challenges right
14:15 exactly exactly and that was when I was
14:18 talking about you know when I started
14:20 five years ago and the company took a
14:22 turn of saying you're no longer going to
14:24 be focused just on the hardware and with
14:26 Hardware you can think of you know you
14:28 build a hardware you sell it one let's
14:31 say a gas meter
14:32 you still at one time
14:34 and then you maybe support it you might
14:37 maintain it there's no there's really
14:39 there's there's a software component but
14:41 this is like sort of like six five years
14:43 ago the company turned and said we're
14:45 going to be doing a lot more software
14:47 now
14:48 and uh
14:49 essentially we're this is the complexity
14:52 of uh you know integrating of uh data
14:55 workflows and and and algorithms that
14:58 are based on on data come come and place
15:01 and so really you know it was such an
15:05 honor of being a part of you know
15:07 putting the company on on the trajectory
15:09 of change and I won't say that first of
15:12 all I won't say that everything went you
15:15 know perfectly well we will learn from
15:17 we learn from our mistakes but it's also
15:20 always you know it's a very difficult
15:22 thing to
15:24 to make a shift like that in a company
15:26 with a 100 year old history and and 100
15:29 000 people it's uh it's it's humongous
15:32 it's humongous separate
15:33 and this is where you make sure that you
15:36 know you learn there's so there's so
15:38 much complexity here that you learn
15:40 really fast
15:42 and I'm really curious now that you
15:44 mentioned this is not what I was going
15:46 to ask initially but now that you
15:48 mentioned that a gas meter you just sell
15:51 it and support it
15:52 right and there is no way you can
15:54 include software
15:56 so can you actually include software
15:58 into the gas meter
16:00 or it's just you know
16:03 right well you know you and you have of
16:07 course like a lawn tail you have
16:08 products that are more
16:11 um
16:12 more conventional and uh less
16:15 intelligent which is just start building
16:17 intelligence into them well I I can I
16:20 can a better example would be uh for
16:23 example we we work we started working on
16:26 some Advanced sensors for the quality of
16:29 of the air for example
16:32 um and uh before I worked on this
16:35 problem I really you know I didn't think
16:37 that that was such a such a problem well
16:39 you're breathing air right I mean how
16:41 could that be dangerous but then when we
16:43 started actually looking under the
16:44 microscope what are the different things
16:46 that that we are breathing in uh like
16:49 mold and and pollen and pet dander and
16:53 dust uh you get you get really scared
16:55 you know what what you're really prison
16:57 with or things like when you buy a house
17:00 and and you you realize that you know I
17:02 had a cat allergy and I realized when I
17:05 moved in that there was a cat living
17:07 here and we had to do a deep cleaning
17:09 here but so and so we're for example uh
17:12 building um that sensor that with the
17:15 push of a button can tell you all the
17:17 micro allergens that are that are in the
17:19 air and so what what you're actually
17:22 getting from making those things
17:24 connected is first of all you now can
17:27 process the data in the cloud and you
17:30 can run massive massive uh signal
17:34 processing and the the the analysis on
17:37 the data that you that you process and
17:39 you're able not only run the workflows
17:42 and workloads in the cloud but you can
17:44 actually you know get this data and
17:46 fine-tune your your model of course and
17:49 so that that allows you to to Really
17:51 build in you know the algorithms that
17:53 you wouldn't be able to literally and
17:55 you know otherwise you would need a
17:57 whole computer with it you know an
18:00 industrial GPU on it and that this
18:02 device would would cost you know like
18:04 several thousand dollars and things like
18:05 that the you cannot put it physically in
18:09 a gas meter right
18:10 yeah exactly exactly exactly
18:13 so coming back to data science practice
18:16 so you mentioned that the data science
18:17 practice is a set of data science and
18:20 machine learning practices uh more like
18:23 a yeah how do you spread the adoption of
18:26 these practices right and then you
18:27 mentioned
18:29 um like not having silos having the same
18:31 tools and processes in different teams
18:34 and
18:36 sounds like a very good thing to have
18:39 and I'm wondering
18:41 I'm joining a company it is a data
18:44 science uh I don't know at the first
18:47 data scientist I don't know data science
18:48 manager or maybe director or just as a
18:51 data scientist and we want to build it
18:55 so how do we build
18:58 this data science practices and what are
19:00 the steps to get there right
19:04 um
19:06 so here of course
19:08 yeah I might say it depends but um
19:12 it really depends on multiple factors
19:15 um I won't say there's just a I sort of
19:18 have like a mental model of going from
19:20 low maturity to a high maturity or like
19:23 I say you know you you crawl you walk
19:26 and then you then then you run
19:29 um a lot depends on you know um the the
19:33 size of the organization of course a lot
19:36 depends on uh whether
19:38 um you know where you would want to
19:41 um what would be the focus so where are
19:42 you going to deliver the value and or in
19:45 other words actually the the the first
19:48 major
19:49 and then if you know when you're
19:51 interviewing with a company where you're
19:53 working in a company it's good to
19:54 reflect on uh who uh in the
19:58 organizational hierarchy the data the
20:01 data science team is reporting into
20:04 and um you know actually you know I
20:08 never asked myself when when think
20:11 questions like this when when I was just
20:13 an individual contributor but it's it's
20:15 hugely important and it's important
20:17 because uh depending on you know to each
20:20 executive uh the the data function rolls
20:23 into uh this data group could could
20:27 actually do very different things and
20:30 the example would be so if if the data
20:33 function rolls into the CTO or the the
20:37 chief chief technical officer that would
20:40 um most probably mean that the data the
20:43 data group will be focused on enhancing
20:45 the the product product capabilities
20:48 right so CTO is responsible for building
20:51 building an offering or building a
20:53 product right so if you are reporting to
20:55 CTO that means that your function goals
20:59 would be to enhance the capability of um
21:02 of your of the actual product that you
21:04 the that you work on but this is not the
21:06 only thing because you could also for
21:08 example report into CIO Chief
21:11 Information officer and in this case
21:14 very likely you would be working a lot
21:17 on the internal optimization
21:22 workflows like optimization of
21:24 efficiencies of of your internal
21:28 ecosystem instead of working on the
21:30 product or the data team could report
21:33 into Chief marketing officer and then it
21:36 would mean that it's mostly analytics
21:39 function around marketing and sales and
21:42 customer interaction and so that's
21:45 that's an interesting question to
21:46 reflect on and because really whoever
21:49 you report into that means that the
21:52 goals of that particular executive you
21:55 will be helping to to achieve and so
21:58 when when it's probably the Step Zero to
22:01 to Really reflect on this and say okay
22:03 where the data can you know provide the
22:07 the biggest value and it does not
22:09 necessarily need to be either or
22:11 there are you know organizations that
22:15 report into the CEO or and then in this
22:18 case it would really mean if you're
22:20 important to CEO most likely it would
22:22 mean that you will work across all of
22:24 those functions so the data will have
22:26 their own place both in in product
22:28 engineering both in internal
22:30 optimization both with um you know sales
22:33 and marketing and customer interaction
22:36 um but this is very important question
22:37 to reflect because that would really
22:39 Define what kind of uh what what is the
22:42 profile of the um you know talent that
22:44 you'll be working with what are the
22:46 profile of algorithms that will you will
22:48 be working with the example is so we
22:51 work on on product and the modality of
22:53 the algorithms that we work is is mostly
22:55 signal processing and computer vision
22:57 this is because we work a lot with
22:59 sensing aspect of of our work but then
23:03 we also have a team in Honeywell that
23:04 that works on
23:07 uh optimization of internal processes
23:09 like demand prediction for example and
23:13 that team doesn't do any computer vision
23:14 that team only works with essentially
23:17 you know a fairly conventional
23:19 Predictive Analytics algorithm there's
23:21 nothing there is nothing wrong about it
23:23 but it's just a different type of of uh
23:26 algorithms that you will be working on
23:28 and so it's good to actually understand
23:30 you know because you that that question
23:31 that answered with align you what kind
23:33 of talent what kind of algorithms what
23:36 kind of technology and the
23:37 infrastructure that you will have to
23:39 build in order to to fulfill those goals
23:42 I hope it makes sense yeah it does I'm
23:44 just wondering um so the company where I
23:46 work it's called toilet so we're doing
23:49 like it's on land Marketplace when I
23:51 joined the company the data functional I
23:54 don't know how to call it like my
23:56 manager was reporting to a CPO Chief
23:58 product officer in this case I think
24:01 it's a similar idea like reporting to a
24:04 CTO so improving the pro product right
24:07 but here in this case product has its
24:10 own uh I don't know vertical or how to
24:14 how to call it
24:16 and I guess in case if you report
24:20 directly to CEO it makes you a chief
24:22 data officer in this case
24:25 uh now it could be not yet I mean some
24:28 organization call it formally Chief data
24:31 officer
24:32 um it could be you know it could be
24:34 still VP of uh of
24:38 the VP of data or yes right but
24:42 reporting to CEO mean that you would
24:44 it's it's it's that you would not only
24:47 have a focus on engineering or you would
24:49 not only have a focus on on internal um
24:52 I.T and things like that so your
24:53 function will will go
24:56 um will go much much broader
24:58 and it's it's really about who is going
25:00 to be your executive sponsor well and
25:03 you know which and your executive
25:06 sponsor is going to lead and assign
25:09 particular goals and particular
25:10 initiatives for you so it's it's hugely
25:13 important but um as we as we go through
25:15 this and and you talk um you know um so
25:19 you you ask about sort of like the steps
25:22 right but I my mental model is that you
25:25 you go through low maturity and medium
25:28 maturity and high maturity and the low
25:31 maturity would mean that
25:33 um you know you come into the team and
25:35 you start building a team that usually
25:36 you know um uh it and it depends on on
25:40 the you know who drives that there are
25:43 situations when the executives drive
25:45 that and they would hire a senior senior
25:49 roles and sort of like uh the the the
25:51 initiative of developing this practice
25:54 would come from the executive level but
25:56 many times the the initiative of
25:58 building data into products or internal
26:02 capabilities would come from
26:04 from Engineers themselves right and I've
26:08 been I've been there myself when I came
26:10 to Carnival we had a sort of similar
26:13 situation some of the initiatives that
26:16 we were building really came from from
26:18 the software Engineers who at some point
26:21 of time got inspired by data and they
26:24 started working uh you know was was with
26:26 machine learning algorithms or other
26:29 conventional data algorithms or another
26:33 approach would be engineering managers
26:36 would would think of additional
26:37 capabilities and they would start hiring
26:41 um data scientists and thinking that you
26:44 can just hire a data scientist plug them
26:47 into the team
26:49 and then overnight
26:51 you know magic will happen and overnight
26:54 the products will get you know some
26:57 magic magic intelligence artificial
26:59 intelligence diet type a lot of profit
27:01 yes yes yes but it it doesn't happen
27:04 this way and you know data science or
27:07 artificial intelligence it's it's a very
27:09 multi or cross-functional type of uh
27:12 stacks and this is one of the
27:15 misconceptions where you can just hire a
27:17 PhD and overnight you'll get to get the
27:20 benefit and I think many organizations
27:22 underestimate the complexity of it
27:24 because it really impacts
27:27 you know the the talent that you have
27:31 and there is more than just data
27:33 scientists right and we can talk about
27:35 this there are more research scientists
27:37 there are machine learning Engineers
27:38 there are data Engineers
27:40 um there are there are impact into the
27:42 infrastructure and there's impact into
27:45 you know how you run processes there is
27:47 an impact in the whole mindset shift
27:49 where you know going from a sort of
27:53 pre-planned waterfall type of approach
27:56 to engineering into into more iterative
27:58 engineering and so there are those
28:00 things that you you don't really many
28:02 people sometimes from the conventional
28:04 software background they don't know
28:07 about and this is why there is just High
28:09 expectation uh and and this is why
28:12 things take take so much so much long
28:15 long time than I originally assumed
28:18 I'm just curious um in in your opinion
28:22 what is more what happens more often
28:25 that it comes from the engineers from
28:27 the you know bottom-up approach or more
28:30 like executive decides they listen to
28:32 some Consultants from McKinsey and
28:34 decide to build this uh practice what
28:38 does happen more often
28:40 yeah I I don't have that you know being
28:43 data driven I don't have those stats but
28:47 um I think it's anecdotally right and I
28:51 I think it's it's a combination of of
28:53 that uh you know I see I see both of
28:57 those situations the same way like
28:59 you're talking about you know both
29:01 McKinsey Consultants but you know CEOs
29:04 and ctOS you know we are not talking
29:06 about something that came just just
29:08 yesterday right the the the the data
29:10 science got popularized
29:13 you know um
29:15 I I think the peak was roughly around
29:17 five five four years ago when it was
29:19 really at the peak uh right now
29:21 everybody knows about it almost um but
29:24 but also I see a lot of uh Engineers who
29:27 are who software Engineers with
29:29 conventional backgrounds that that uh
29:31 you know because AI becomes such a hot
29:34 topic that and there is so much of
29:37 democratization you know there are the
29:38 tools that we have right now when you
29:40 can you know like the example was you
29:44 know stable diffusion when you can just
29:46 download a Google collab notebook run a
29:49 few cells and and you know and and you
29:51 would have the whole the whole thing in
29:53 front of you and and I think many people
29:55 were just really feel very empowered by
29:58 that and and want to
30:01 um you know will get get excited and
30:03 over excited sometimes about it and this
30:05 is something I I really often you know
30:07 try to try to watch out for both for
30:10 myself and for my team because if you
30:12 get over excited about something
30:14 you sometimes get really biased
30:17 and instead of really you know working
30:19 through what's what's important for the
30:21 customer you start working on something
30:24 just because you want to try this
30:25 technology
30:27 and AI becomes you know not a solution
30:31 for some customer problem but it becomes
30:34 you know a shiny things that that nobody
30:36 knows so when you think about you know
30:39 integrating you know data science
30:41 workload or building up data science
30:43 capabilities you really need to start
30:45 from what's really how can I really
30:48 improve my customer experience instead
30:50 of hey I have this shiny technology hey
30:52 let's find where we can where we can
30:55 plug this technology into yeah I mean I
30:58 think so many people just get done super
31:00 super biased about this
31:01 speaking of stable diffusion set this is
31:04 indeed super cool so the other day I
31:07 played with this and generated the data
31:09 set with dragons and dinosaurs so to me
31:13 they always looked the same and they
31:15 thought okay maybe we can just get some
31:18 data with uh dinosaurs and dragons and
31:21 then like they're like it's still like
31:24 the pictures are creepy still but
31:27 sometimes they're really good
31:29 okay we're coming back to this building
31:31 the practice so let's say we join a
31:34 company and we figure out what that we
31:36 report to like which executive we report
31:39 to
31:40 um like the options as you mentioned the
31:44 CTO CMO CIO
31:48 um C CEO all of them all of them right
31:52 so what happens next like what do we do
31:55 next so we figure out that let's say
31:56 it's a CTO well what's next
32:00 yeah so usually you know you you get to
32:03 you get to really understand and and you
32:05 know the way you usually works is that
32:09 um you know the the right thing of
32:10 course is understand you know what what
32:12 kind of uh what kind of problems we want
32:15 to solve was data or what kind of
32:18 capabilities we want to build with that
32:21 um but it's not always it doesn't always
32:24 work like this as I said there are some
32:26 grassroot efforts bottom up when
32:28 Engineers start start coming up with new
32:31 ideas right there you know um and and
32:34 start building some uh some proof of
32:37 Concepts
32:38 and and usually the first stage is what
32:40 I call Crawl stage right um before you
32:43 walk you you go you gotta crawl this is
32:45 where teams start to kind of build uh
32:49 build those proof of Concepts and
32:52 usually it's uh with a with a company
32:54 that still has not built a mature data
32:57 practice uh this is a big really big big
33:01 challenge is to move some of those proof
33:04 of Concepts in into production because
33:07 again the expectation is hey let's just
33:09 hire a PhD data scientist they will just
33:11 build a model
33:13 there we go we'll we'll have this new
33:16 magic functionality but again it it
33:18 doesn't work like this project and then
33:21 this is what exactly the the situation
33:24 when I came to Honeywell five years ago
33:26 when we had some data scientists here
33:28 and there they were hired by
33:30 conventional software engineering
33:32 managers who didn't know anything about
33:34 the data and so the expectation though
33:36 was that we're just going to hire them
33:38 plug them and they will they will start
33:41 working on them but it's it's more than
33:43 that and you know first of all it's it's
33:45 really about the fact that it's very
33:48 easy to build um flashy proof of concept
33:51 demos
33:52 but it's very difficult to to get them
33:56 into the production because as you know
33:59 well um
34:01 first of all building a model
34:04 um is on you know a small data set for
34:08 the flashy demo
34:10 uh you can you can probably get some
34:13 some data points that you can that you
34:14 can build the model but really to make
34:16 it a robust model you gotta have a
34:19 different level of uh volume of of your
34:22 data set and that's that's always a
34:25 problem where are we we're gonna get get
34:27 the data and unfortunately the companies
34:29 that are not as mature they don't
34:31 prioritize build collecting data early
34:34 enough and uh which has to be really
34:38 prioritized right there when you when
34:40 you when you actually build a project
34:43 passport right you know the the Step
34:45 Zero when you're thinking about the
34:47 project when were you thinking about the
34:49 the feature or function that you're
34:51 going to integrate into the existing
34:52 project you gotta you gotta start
34:55 thinking you know where are we going to
34:56 get the data on top of which we are
34:58 going to build build our model and
35:01 companies don't prioritize that so to
35:03 build a you know a initial model you
35:06 know it takes it takes some time but it
35:08 takes 10x more time too and then you
35:11 know many other many other reasons you
35:13 know that uh
35:15 a really uh things like you know the
35:19 engineering component of uh of uh
35:22 building data products is uh is
35:25 different from conventional uh software
35:27 engineering
35:29 um and uh just by building a model you
35:31 cannot enable the feature right you need
35:33 to integrate this model
35:34 you need to deploy this model you need
35:38 to watch and or personalize this model
35:40 you need to be able to have the closed
35:42 loop of retraining this model based on
35:45 the the new data that is coming in and
35:47 so usually this is not how conventional
35:49 software engineering work so you really
35:51 need to change the processes change the
35:54 infrastructure and so that takes time
35:56 and so this is why often you know the
35:59 you know you have you know hard time
36:02 really to to deploy those demos and I've
36:05 been I've been myself grown many times
36:07 on this and this is exactly how I
36:10 started myself
36:11 but you you reflect on on all of those
36:15 issues and you you start fixing them by
36:18 one by one and so in this scroll stage
36:20 in the beginning stage I'm not a big fan
36:22 of having many different projects and
36:24 seeing what actually works out because
36:27 you have multiple teams and when you
36:29 have multiple teams and multiple
36:31 scientists and engineers and it's more
36:33 difficult to to manage them my Approach
36:36 is having a few
36:39 fewer projects as possible on which you
36:42 can build the whole end-to-end process
36:47 and so in in the scroll stage the idea
36:50 is usually
36:51 just get one project out of the door end
36:55 to end one project that would become
36:57 sort of like a poster child an example
36:59 for
37:01 for the for the full full
37:04 cycle of uh running of collecting data
37:08 running experiments identifying which
37:10 model is the best knowing changing the
37:13 infrastructure and having the roles of
37:16 people who would work on the
37:17 infrastructure to be able to product uh
37:19 productize those models monitor those
37:22 models retrain those models essentially
37:24 having a whole end-to-end and end-to-end
37:27 cycle and this is where you know I would
37:30 say you know put the major focus on
37:32 having at least one project that is that
37:35 is successful instead of having 10
37:37 projects that that fail
37:39 because if you have 10 projects that
37:40 fail what actually also what happens is
37:42 that data science gets a bad reputation
37:45 and and people get actually a lot more
37:48 negative about uh building uh data
37:51 enabled products so I would here put put
37:55 most of my ads in one basket and running
37:58 and end to end and this is where you
38:00 switch into the next phase phase of data
38:04 maturity and you build a centralized
38:08 centralized practice that means you want
38:10 to
38:12 um now get all the all the efforts and
38:16 all the scientists in one organization
38:19 and really start building when working
38:22 on your photos you mean like a team
38:24 right right
38:26 and in in early stages it's good to to
38:29 collect all of them in one team or all
38:32 in one organization
38:33 and centralize them and what I mean by
38:36 that is that you need to build uh you
38:38 know a set of best practices
38:40 and you need within one team what makes
38:43 it easier that if this all of those
38:46 people under one team it's easier to
38:48 popularize those best practices and
38:51 integrate and deploy those best practice
38:52 and what I mean by Best Practices it
38:54 starts with Talent Acquisitions and
38:57 hiring of understanding vichar what are
38:59 the actual roles what are the difference
39:02 between research scientists machine
39:04 learning engineer data engineer quality
39:07 data quality engineer and other
39:09 professions and really understanding
39:12 what the qual what what the difference
39:13 between those having actually job
39:15 descriptions for those because when you
39:18 start actually HR you come to HR and
39:19 they don't know what you know who would
39:22 who do we need to hire and when you hire
39:23 wrong people everything is wrong after
39:25 that it starts from you know aligning on
39:29 a particular set of infrastructure and
39:31 tools right so which Cloud are we going
39:34 to be using are we going to be using
39:36 Cloud are we going to be using on-prem
39:38 we can be using our own
39:41 deployments what kind of tools we are
39:43 going to be using are we going to write
39:44 our own experiment tracking system or
39:47 we're going to be using uh you know
39:49 other tools on the markets from weights
39:52 and biases Neptune call Matt and and so
39:54 on and so forth whatever how we're going
39:57 to be productizing uh and deploying
39:59 those models and things like that so you
40:02 when when you are within one team it's
40:04 it's a lot easier to uh and faster to
40:07 build those those best practices
40:09 and and really align the team on on
40:12 those best practices but the trick is to
40:15 centralized approach is actually it's
40:18 it's uh
40:20 how I think and I could be it's it's
40:22 really subjective it's not the moment
40:24 it's not the best way of of managing uh
40:27 data organizations but it's it's the the
40:29 step that you have to go through you
40:32 know on the way to to more to higher
40:34 maturity
40:35 so
40:36 in in the way you start with ad hoc
40:39 approach where you build uh you know one
40:41 major proof of concept you go to a
40:43 centralized model where you get the team
40:46 together and you build set of practices
40:48 by working on on more projects but this
40:52 is not the most efficient way of of
40:54 running data teams most in most cases
40:57 just because when when you have a
41:00 centralized team and let's say a product
41:03 manager comes to you and say hey we need
41:05 to build this let's say a recommendation
41:07 engine for for our website can you give
41:10 us you know a data scientist and so you
41:13 have a list of projects that you work on
41:16 as a centralized team and then you you
41:19 need to you know Market your team
41:21 internally so product managers or
41:23 engineering managers come to you and you
41:25 use and you and you act sort of like a
41:27 resource pool but then it doesn't work
41:30 most most efficient because
41:33 um there is a queue essentially you need
41:35 to prioritize those projects and how do
41:37 you prioritize those projects right but
41:40 also you get a a data scientist or a
41:43 machine learning engineer or data
41:45 engineer that they today they work on
41:47 one project and tomorrow they work on a
41:49 different project
41:50 and so they don't really work with
41:53 consistently with one team they not
41:56 necessarily know how people or how those
41:59 teams operate and act right they don't
42:02 establish trust and respect with those
42:05 teams and what I also found out you know
42:09 through
42:09 through a lot of mistakes and hard
42:12 experiences that
42:14 when you have a centralized team
42:16 your scientists
42:19 uh their performance is treated by their
42:23 own scope and let me I'll it's going to
42:26 get clearer now but if you actually push
42:30 that scientist and actually right there
42:33 into the team and having that scientist
42:36 actually report
42:37 into that team and be formally a part of
42:40 that team
42:42 the performance of that scientist is
42:44 going to be treated more like on based
42:46 on the performance of the whole project
42:48 right so we on one side you have a
42:50 centralized team and performance of the
42:52 scientists is is rated on the
42:55 performance of their work but if they
42:57 work in in
43:00 for for a particular team a report for a
43:03 particular engineering manager for
43:04 example their performance is more going
43:06 to be treated as a performance of
43:09 overall project which you actually want
43:11 you don't want them to you don't want
43:13 your your engineers and scientists only
43:16 to say hey this is my type of work
43:19 this is only what I'm responsible for I
43:21 don't care about anything else you
43:23 actually want them to be
43:25 um you know
43:27 drivers and and the fans of the project
43:30 itself and and think like the project
43:32 success fully relies on them and so this
43:36 is where the Third
43:38 uh model just
43:41 um that's a lot of information and I
43:43 want to try to summarize everything you
43:46 said before we move to the uh what you
43:48 call around Facebook yep decentralized
43:52 yeah so first
43:54 um we need to figure out who is our
43:56 executive sponsor and then that it also
43:58 helps us to understand which problems to
44:01 solve with data what kind of things we
44:03 work on and then we start with a proof
44:06 of concept not many proof of Concepts
44:10 as few as possible uh let's say a single
44:14 one but we need to make sure that
44:16 it is successful at the end right so we
44:19 don't want to fail because if we fail
44:21 then data science gets bad reputation
44:24 and then we might lose trust of our
44:27 executive sponsor who was rooting for us
44:29 right so we don't want to do that so
44:31 because the executive sponsor really
44:33 believed in us so we need to try to
44:37 um
44:37 topic well meet the expectations right
44:40 and then so we do this POC and this POC
44:43 you mentioned that it often comes from
44:45 Engineers who want to do something cool
44:48 and then they pitch it to I don't know
44:50 the managers and then this thing starts
44:53 and then eventually we have a POC and
44:56 then it goes to the next phase
44:59 which is uh I don't know we see
45:03 yeah we don't close the approach yeah
45:05 yeah we don't have any data right we
45:08 need to build all these pipelines and
45:09 then we need to productionize the model
45:10 and we do this centrally because we want
45:14 to make sure that we build this set of
45:16 practices that you mentioned uh
45:18 and then I think it's important to
45:20 understand what kind of roles we need
45:21 what kind of tools we want to use right
45:25 and all these things that you just
45:27 talked about but then decentral
45:30 centralized approach creates problems
45:31 right because you act as a resource pool
45:33 pool and then sometimes there are not
45:36 enough resources in the poll so then we
45:39 need to and all these other problems you
45:41 mentioned that I don't remember uh but
45:44 like there were epiclists right which
45:47 brings us to the next phase the embedded
45:51 teams right where all decentralized
45:53 teams were essential data scientists
45:55 decentralized teams where data
45:57 scientists or data person sits in the
46:00 team right and then this is where I
46:03 stopped you and when you say when it
46:05 sits the importance is who they report
46:08 into
46:09 they could still work on those projects
46:13 but the problem is or the the question
46:15 is who who do they report to do they
46:18 report into let's say the organization
46:20 of Chief data officer
46:22 who is um kind of a central or they
46:25 report to the engineering manager of
46:28 that particular product
46:31 and and it's a big difference because
46:33 you worry your manager is the one who
46:36 rates your performance
46:38 and so uh in in this case it's it's it's
46:42 it's better that usually and you know
46:45 that you you actually push
46:48 you move from a centralized model by
46:50 taking all those people who used to be
46:52 who used to be in your centralized model
46:54 in your own team
46:55 and then you say uh you're now going to
46:58 report uh to this engineering manager
47:00 and you're going to be working for for
47:02 that product or that function
47:05 and uh it's not that it might sound like
47:08 something difficult or heartbreaking
47:10 right you used to report to one manager
47:12 and now you report to a different
47:13 manager but really it's it in in in in
47:16 in my experience many times it actually
47:19 came very naturally because as as people
47:22 work with with different teams they
47:24 create some affinity and some experience
47:27 towards particular problems or
47:28 particular teams or particular business
47:30 domains and it's it's when you
47:33 transition from this centralized to
47:34 decentralized it's actually a much
47:36 easier approach because many times
47:38 people will say yes I want to work for
47:40 that for that product right now
47:42 and so that doesn't create as as main
47:43 friction frictions and this is what we
47:46 went through we we used to have one
47:47 centralized team and then we said this
47:50 you for example you used to work on this
47:53 particular set of problems for this
47:54 particular business for this particular
47:55 product line you are now going to report
47:58 to that engineering manager and you're
48:00 going to be working for them and
48:01 essentially spread your team across and
48:04 you you have them work on on a
48:06 particular folk project
48:08 do you just kick back and don't do
48:11 anything
48:12 oh no no no no well you and this is
48:15 where this is why I say um when
48:17 decentralized models they're not I I've
48:20 never seen fully decentralized models
48:23 work ideally and usually what I call
48:25 Semi decentralized so you still have to
48:28 leave some space you still need to have
48:30 uh one Central function that will be
48:33 responsible for for some of the for some
48:36 of the functions because like for
48:37 example the hiring
48:39 um you know or the the infrastructure
48:41 some of those things have to be still
48:43 Central
48:44 but but the engineering for example
48:47 engineering teams and product
48:48 engineering teams it's better than they
48:50 work with their engineering engineering
48:52 managers and their product teams and so
48:55 there's still some level of sometimes
48:57 this model is called Hub and spokes
48:59 meaning that there is one Hub
49:02 which you still have a chief data
49:04 officer that's responsible for some of
49:06 the high level functions and standards
49:09 but you still then you have different
49:11 team across the organizations
49:13 and that that work all almost
49:16 autonomously you still build Bridges
49:18 between them you still kind of
49:21 work with them to understand what kind
49:23 of problems they have what kind of uh
49:25 you know roadmaps they work on but
49:27 what's what's really important I think
49:29 that it's it's it's you have to have the
49:33 right set of steps and you have to go
49:35 first to centralized and then
49:37 decentralized and the reason for that
49:38 when you are centralized you need to
49:41 build that sets of practices and then
49:43 those people take those practices to
49:45 their own teams
49:46 and they don't start from zero when they
49:49 start when when they are product teams
49:51 and this is hugely important and and
49:53 here your role I guess is still trying
49:56 to make sure that uh or making sure that
49:59 uh they have this common set of
50:01 practices now they are spread and that
50:03 they they might come up with
50:05 their own thing yeah which is fine right
50:07 but you don't want to uh like you still
50:10 want to maintain the same set of tools
50:12 the same set of practices there's still
50:14 some some things and it's not always the
50:16 same like it doesn't mean that everybody
50:18 needs to have to to use Pi torch right
50:20 they're real there's still you know some
50:22 some will use pointers and some of them
50:23 will use tensor but I'll give you a good
50:25 example
50:27 um vendor relationships right when you
50:29 work with tools
50:30 and and procurement of of tools when you
50:34 work uh you know Central function is
50:37 much more efficient in identifying which
50:40 tools we want to procure for those teams
50:43 to to use rather than having those teams
50:46 actually decide what tools they do
50:49 because you don't want to have let's say
50:51 like uh different vendors for the same
50:53 things in different in different groups
50:55 again it's not that black and white but
50:57 usually this is this is how it use it
51:00 works more efficiently see you as a
51:01 central function knowing what kind of
51:04 um what kind of problems your teams are
51:06 dealing you can say hey how about where
51:09 we're using you know I don't know uh
51:12 this particular experiment tracking or
51:14 mlops platform
51:16 and then because this is the way you can
51:18 actually get the best deal and then you
51:21 can help those those teams consume
51:24 um those products so this is one of the
51:26 examples that that work very well or
51:28 like with data annotation or image
51:30 annotation we do a lot of image
51:32 annotation you know what vendor is going
51:34 to be you what vendor are we going to be
51:36 using for data annotation right things
51:38 like that so there are still some
51:39 functions in the central org that is
51:43 more efficient to to to be sold
51:46 it will have quite a bunch of questions
51:48 and not so much time so probably we
51:50 should go to the questions and try to
51:52 answer them and the first question was
51:54 uh which book would you recommend to
51:57 learn more about building a data science
51:59 practice
52:00 other books like that at all
52:03 I
52:05 I have
52:07 I could probably should can I can I post
52:10 a few a few suggestions uh in the
52:13 LinkedIn post to to this event
52:16 there are quite a few I I read a lot on
52:18 this
52:20 um
52:21 I I get some book that I read some time
52:24 ago that that I wanted to recommend
52:26 which was that that was fairly fairly
52:28 amazing I'll have a hard time right now
52:31 to to quickly identify it yeah we can
52:33 include the links in the description
52:35 later we'll find out I promise I promise
52:37 to get back to you
52:39 yeah okay okay another question from
52:42 Adonis you mentioned that software
52:45 Engineers pivot into data science
52:47 and how do they actually convince their
52:50 manager to do this
52:55 um
52:56 it's it's actually so it's it's a good
52:58 question if if you're a software
53:00 engineer you want to Pivot into data
53:02 science
53:03 I have the whole I have actually a long
53:05 post on the LinkedIn about this but my
53:08 advice is always about this is
53:10 uh you it would be very hard for you to
53:13 to get hired as a data scientist from
53:16 scratch if your previous position as a
53:18 software engineer
53:19 so my advice to you is try to convert
53:21 into the data scientist at the same
53:24 company you're currently working it
53:27 so you get actually formally data
53:30 scientist title and you work through and
53:32 get some experience in it you get a few
53:34 years of experience and then you can you
53:36 can either stay in this company or
53:38 speech and get hired into another
53:39 company with a formal row of data
53:42 scientists now what you get can get
53:45 transferred is is really you know it's
53:47 all about finding right problems to
53:49 solve
53:51 and really solving them and if yeah you
53:54 can come and you know and offer let's
53:57 say You're Building I don't know a
53:59 product recommendation algorithm
54:01 and um you know your team doesn't have
54:03 an experience with it
54:05 and you can really in your free time
54:08 dive into this subject
54:10 get you know uh build uh build a
54:12 prototype gather the data build a
54:15 prototype and and and really show to
54:17 your team that you can build a mature
54:20 model it's not going to be easy but it
54:23 will take some time
54:25 uh it's not that the your engineering
54:27 manager you know uh just because you're
54:30 a software engineer they will say no
54:32 sometimes they will say but it's it's
54:33 about being actually uh um
54:37 uh
54:38 persistent in offering yourself as a
54:42 problem solver for uh data habit uh data
54:46 have a problems and within your
54:48 organizations moving to teams that have
54:52 more data so think about from a
54:54 perspective where do I have the data and
54:56 you know what are the problems that I
54:58 can solve with that data and the teams
55:00 that have abundance of data usually have
55:03 problems that you can solve with with
55:04 this data
55:06 that doesn't usually happen at the POC
55:09 stage the centralized stage or
55:11 decentralized stage or does it even
55:13 matter
55:14 it does not but the moment Yeah the more
55:19 mature the organization is the the
55:20 harder it would be to release switch but
55:23 it's not that you won't be able to
55:24 switch so it's we have we I have a few
55:27 examples on people who were uh software
55:30 Engineers actually just were persistent
55:32 and and helping solve hard problems
55:35 using data
55:36 and then at some point of time they you
55:38 know you come to your manager and say
55:40 hey I've been sold I've been essentially
55:41 data scientist for the last two years
55:43 can we work with you for me to formally
55:45 change the title we had we had we had
55:48 use cases like this
55:51 Yeah we actually also had use cases like
55:53 that that in the company where I work a
55:55 person was a data engineer and then he
55:57 said okay look I'm actually doing the
56:00 melody engineering for the last two
56:01 years and can we exactly make the switch
56:04 formally exactly then I guess at the POC
56:08 stage it's the simplest right so just
56:10 okay there's this cool thing let us try
56:12 and then this thing works and all of a
56:15 sudden one year later you're just doing
56:17 this thing right but but if if your
56:21 software engineer Google pro most likely
56:23 underestimate the complexity of it yeah
56:26 you might build again a model that works
56:28 for the demo but really integrating it
56:30 in a robust way there's a long way to
56:33 from from a demo to robust model
56:36 and you will probably underestimate that
56:37 so that it's it's not weeks and it's not
56:40 months um yeah from that level yeah so
56:44 another question we have is what is your
56:48 favorite data science practice so far
56:51 like I guess we talked about all this
56:53 best practices uh no like what do you
56:56 think is the most important one to have
57:00 uh
57:01 practice as a interesting interesting
57:05 question I mean
57:09 I mean I think what's what's most
57:11 impactful is
57:13 um and and where many people are making
57:15 mistakes is is really that
57:19 if you hire a PhD scientist
57:23 you should not rely on what they make to
57:26 product or not product onize because and
57:29 you don't sure you should not rely that
57:30 the code that they write in a in a
57:33 Jupiter notebook could be transferred
57:36 into production for this you will need
57:39 another stage of a machine learning
57:41 engineer
57:42 and or applied data Sciences who would
57:45 then re-crunch all of that code and put
57:48 it under production and I think many
57:51 organizations many people or many many
57:53 managers was with the conventional
57:54 background they don't understand that
57:57 that there is there is actually these
57:59 are the two extremes of developing a
58:01 model
58:03 and having that model run in in
58:05 production
58:06 and you have to put in place other roles
58:09 to ensure that you can drop make this
58:12 code robust
58:13 uh to to productalize it yeah it's
58:17 probably not like uh the best practice
58:19 but more like realization and a way to
58:22 set expectations that look if we hire
58:25 this person who has a PHD in machine
58:29 learning it doesn't mean that we
58:31 automatically get rich tomorrow right so
58:34 managing these expectations and I'm
58:36 saying that okay we actually need a team
58:38 of Engineers to make it work that's uh
58:43 that would be your answer right the the
58:45 the that essentially comes down to
58:47 having a clear roles
58:49 that there is a research scientist and
58:51 distinguished in research scientist from
58:54 machine learning engineer I can tell you
58:56 one example we're running out of time
58:57 but I used to work with PhD research
59:00 scientists and every time I come with a
59:03 problem to them they say let me go and
59:06 read white papers
59:08 and that you know many times you don't
59:09 need to read white papers there is this
59:12 solution up front for you that you can
59:15 do but I I see a heavy Reliance on hey
59:18 let me let me go and I'm gonna go you
59:20 know for two weeks and I'm gonna read
59:21 white papers before I'll give you a
59:24 solution
59:25 and this is what I clearly is like
59:27 research scientist mindset that does not
59:30 work well when you productize anything
59:34 it's great to have them
59:36 but it's you have to plug additional
59:38 roles in order to to transition to the
59:41 to production
59:42 okay well before we finish today do you
59:47 want to maybe you wanted to mention
59:48 something but didn't have a chance
59:52 oh well we spoke uh we talked about so
59:54 so much already uh I hope it uh yeah it
59:58 uh
1:00:00 it resonated and I know we had a lot of
1:00:03 uh you know scientists and Engineers uh
1:00:06 in in the audience
1:00:07 again my my advice would be you know if
1:00:11 you if you want to grow
1:00:14 um you need to think from the
1:00:15 perspective of the higher you go in your
1:00:18 seniority the more impact you have
1:00:21 across
1:00:22 the the stack across the team across the
1:00:25 business across the organization and so
1:00:29 my advice is uh
1:00:32 you know spend some little amount of
1:00:34 time of learning of what actually
1:00:37 happens just beyond of your of your
1:00:41 scope of your role
1:00:43 um that will Propel you faster to to the
1:00:47 next level
1:00:48 um and again uh
1:00:50 the the people are promoted
1:00:53 not because they will want they will
1:00:56 learn the the skills they will require
1:00:59 at the next level they are promoted
1:01:02 because they already
1:01:04 exercise the skills that need to be at
1:01:08 the next level
1:01:09 so this is why you know be be more uh
1:01:13 forth looking into you know what are
1:01:15 other teams or enrolls are are doing and
1:01:18 be more open about you know how do I
1:01:21 make a broader scope type of impact
1:01:23 beyond what what just I'm currently
1:01:27 working on and thanks for this chat uh I
1:01:29 hope that was uh that was uh that was
1:01:31 interesting
1:01:32 am I right at the best way to reach out
1:01:34 to you is LinkedIn
1:01:36 LinkedIn would be would be the best yeah
