1:05 questions about data governance
1:07 so do check it out
1:11 then also in a couple of weeks we have
1:14 a conference it's not really a
1:15 conference it's like a
1:17 bunch of meetups but we call it summer

1:48 and finally uh thanks to o'reilly we had
1:52 five copies of the data governance book
1:55 uh which uh we gave away
1:59 to our community and five people won it
2:02 congratulations
2:03 i will be in touch with you uh with uh
2:06 details how you get

2:16 ready to start
2:19 yes do you have your glass of water
2:21 would you
2:23 check okay with ice
2:26 okay it means we're ready to start right
2:29 yeah okay so
2:38 let me just get my notes and
2:42 yeah this week we'll talk about uh data
2:44 governance
2:45 and we have two special guests and this
2:47 is the first time i actually have two
2:49 guests
2:50 in this podcast so far it was only one
2:53 so it will be a lot of fun i'm sure so
2:55 we have two guests
2:56 jesse and tui they both work on google
2:59 and they
2:59 both are co-authors of the data
3:02 governance governance book that we just
3:04 saw jesse is a senior user experience
3:08 researcher
3:08 at google cloud she conducts user
3:11 studies with customers
3:12 and then she uses these findings to
3:15 shape google's data governance program
3:17 and products
3:18 and uri is a product manager at google
3:20 and he's leading
3:21 data governance efforts in google so
3:25 welcome thank you hello
3:29 now before we go into our main topic of
3:32 data governance uh let's start with your
3:34 background
3:36 so maybe we will start with jesse jc can
3:38 you tell us about your career journey so
3:40 far
3:41 sure um it's been a
3:45 a long one i've done a lot of different
3:47 things
3:48 um i i started out as a
3:51 psychology major and looking at
3:54 research loved research
3:57 back in the you know early 2000s there
4:00 weren't a whole lot of jobs for somebody
4:02 who had a degree in psychology so i
4:04 bounced around and did a lot of
4:05 different things
4:06 um real estate uh you know
4:09 coaching athletics until i finally found
4:13 this
4:14 thing called ux research and i'm like
4:16 what is this ux you speak of
4:18 um and it was this perfect marriage of
4:20 psychology
4:22 and actual useful stuff that you could
4:24 do for people that um was pretty
4:26 immediate
4:27 so i started in um that maybe seven or
4:29 eight years ago
4:31 and i worked at t-mobile on their
4:32 enterprise products for about four years
4:35 until i moved to google
4:36 and i've been here um working with uri
4:38 pretty much the entire time i've been
4:39 here at google on
4:41 cloud and data governance for the last
4:42 three years
4:46 oh thanks
4:50 yeah well my background is much more
4:52 banal i guess for product manager just
4:54 say i never knew you were in real estate
4:56 so every day you learn something new um
5:00 i spent the last couple of decades like
5:03 i started off
5:04 as an engineer in a security company i
5:07 moved to product because people was
5:09 tired were tired of me criticizing the
5:11 product and then you were
5:12 like how about you actually do something
5:14 about prioritizing those criticisms
5:17 um and i've spent
5:20 uh several years in security company was
5:23 an early employee
5:24 in full scout and checkpoint
5:27 was most recently before google the
5:30 vice president of product management in
5:32 a security company called mobileiron
5:35 for endpoints devices um
5:38 the it's kind of funny how i
5:41 got to google because throughout my
5:44 career it's been a couple of decades now
5:47 i've been caring for data on
5:50 endpoint devices and the google offer
5:53 was really about
5:54 how about you sort of cross the
5:58 mirror across to the looking glass
6:01 and get to careful data at the source
6:04 at at the server side at the cloud
6:08 provider side
6:09 and data governance
6:12 has been around for a long long time it
6:15 was
6:16 something google has been doing from
6:17 google
6:19 throughout its history but uh it was an
6:22 initiative that basically the challenge
6:25 was to bring
6:26 data governance to google cloud
6:28 customers
6:29 and i'm sure we'll talk more about that
6:33 so now you also care about security but
6:36 uh from a different angle
6:38 yeah yeah okay yes we mentioned data
6:42 governance and actually the talk
6:44 today is about data governance so what
6:48 is it i to be honest i still uh have
6:50 really awake idea what
6:52 data coordinates is and why do we need
6:54 it
6:57 i i i'll start with that um
7:00 so data governance i guess
7:04 maybe maybe i should start with saying
7:05 what it's not only
7:07 um so i feel like when often people talk
7:09 about data governance
7:11 um and and you're right depending on who
7:13 you talk to there is
7:15 like a myriad of different definitions
7:17 but i guess
7:18 um from our perspective what it's not
7:20 only it's not only securing your data
7:23 so it's not only about um how do we
7:26 govern the things that what i like to
7:28 call the scary stuff right
7:30 pii credit card numbers you know things
7:33 like that
7:34 it's not just about securing those and
7:37 um monitoring access to those so
7:40 sorry pii is what oh
7:44 or is it personally identifiable data
7:47 thank you
7:47 i always protected something
7:52 yeah thank you so things like a name a
7:55 social security number
7:56 um date of birth
8:00 potentially so i think
8:03 recently with gdpr um like
8:07 a lot of companies and folks are very
8:08 worried about data governance
8:10 you know or governing their sensitive
8:13 data
8:15 but and we talk a lot about this in the
8:16 book it's more than that it's also about
8:19 knowing what data do i have period
8:22 because if you don't know what data you
8:24 have you can't really use it you can't
8:25 run analytics you know you also can't
8:27 secure it
8:28 um you can't really decide where it
8:30 should go
8:31 what you should do with it whether or
8:33 not it's a duplicate
8:34 should you retain it so data governance
8:37 really kind of encompasses
8:38 the entire story of what data do i have
8:42 and um and and how how can i use it best
8:47 uh whether that means securing it or
8:49 using it for you know business
8:51 uh analytics things like that
8:54 erie did i miss anything do you want to
8:56 add no
8:57 but i'd like to offer a different
8:59 perspective maybe that adds on to what
9:01 jesse said
9:02 so so first of all data governance has
9:04 is
9:05 actually not new okay data governance
9:09 broadly speaking is a practice of
9:12 the people processes and tools or the
9:15 usage or the combinations of those three
9:18 in order to understand
9:22 care extract insights from your data
9:25 now the the reason i'm saying it's not
9:28 new
9:28 and what made it more
9:33 the term itself more popular recently is
9:36 it always was the case where any company
9:38 would have a customer list
9:40 any company would have uh certain
9:43 insights
9:44 of that customer list that has been ever
9:46 since companies were born
9:48 the normal insights was like this
9:49 customer is behind on his payments or
9:51 something like
9:52 that now here is something that has been
9:54 happening
9:55 uh surprisingly slowly and yet
9:59 had implications that made data
10:01 governance a very popular term
10:03 uh cloud cloud did not happen in one day
10:06 and the cloud uh sort of like
10:09 transformational transition is still
10:11 happening
10:12 much more slowly in my opinion than
10:14 anyone expected
10:15 but cloud got to the game unlimited
10:18 infrastructure
10:19 and that part of the game the abilities
10:22 for companies to say okay i would not
10:23 only save
10:25 the payments table maybe i'll save the
10:27 customer behaviors table
10:29 maybe i'll look at all the events that's
10:31 happening as people interact with the
10:33 product
10:34 maybe that will allow me to say okay if
10:37 people are spending
10:38 time in my e-commerce website in the
10:42 t-shirts department maybe i need more
10:44 choice in t-shirts
10:46 maybe if people are buying a lot of
10:48 t-shirts
10:49 towards the 4th of july maybe that's a
10:52 good time to make sure my supply chain
10:54 is ready for the 4th of july
10:56 and so on now this trend
11:00 of saving more data for insight switch i
11:03 don't know actually what these are right
11:05 now i'll just collect all the data
11:07 has made people uncomfortable
11:10 and cause caused several things one is
11:13 uh the regulator stepped in and said
11:15 okay
11:15 you're collecting a lot of information
11:17 about people
11:18 this information may identify them and
11:21 those people have not signed up to be
11:22 identified
11:24 like i don't want the 4th of july
11:26 t-shirt website
11:28 uh to know my buying habits
11:31 because that's highly personal it may
11:32 indicate where i live it may indicate
11:35 uh how much money i have i'm not
11:38 comfortable with that the european
11:39 regulation
11:41 uh sort of like says a you must
11:44 explicitly ask for people to share the
11:46 information and b
11:48 uh you should separate the people with
11:50 processes and tools
11:52 that collect pii personally identify
11:54 information
11:55 from other systems in order for me as
11:58 the customer of your
11:59 again the t-shirt website um to be able
12:03 to say hey
12:04 you know what i'm done with my business
12:06 uh
12:07 with your website i want to be taken off
12:10 now uh this uh
12:14 accumulation of highly personal data
12:17 that can easily predict and identify you
12:20 uh it also led to some mishaps uh the
12:23 most uh
12:24 well most notorious one is the cambridge
12:26 analytical
12:27 scandal that others
12:30 and really forced companies
12:33 that realize they can make money from
12:35 data
12:36 also to be more
12:41 prescriptive and cautious about using
12:44 the data
12:45 and that is sort of like the chain of
12:47 thought
12:48 that led to this practice now as i said
12:50 it was always there
12:52 if you look at the banking industry uh
12:54 the banking industry has always been
12:56 like you must keep
12:57 uh depending on the country seven years
12:59 of data
13:00 in order for us to go back on
13:02 transactions and detect ford
13:04 for example uh and that is usually
13:07 proven by a chain of transactions or a
13:09 chain of money movements
13:11 and banking or the financial services
13:14 community as a general
13:16 uh always had rules about how you can
13:19 collect the data
13:20 how long to keep it and who should be
13:22 able to access it
13:23 data governance is taking that practice
13:26 making it
13:27 more accessible and hopefully
13:31 as data governance goes it will become
13:33 not as jesse said
13:35 a security mechanism but rather an
13:38 enabler
13:39 that allows people to access more data
13:42 safely
13:43 with groud rails that prevent them from
13:45 falling into
13:46 pits of like inadvertently sharing data
13:49 and basically making more useful
13:51 insights bringing us
13:52 more useful products there's a lot of
13:54 products not just
13:56 t-shirts or things like that that are
13:59 possible
14:00 because we can understand what people
14:02 want for example
14:04 okay that's a lot of information so i'll
14:06 try to summarize and maybe you correct
14:08 me if i'm wrong
14:09 so uh we have a lot of data let's start
14:12 we start collecting data
14:14 and then in order for an analyst to be
14:16 able to understand the data they need to
14:18 know
14:19 what we actually have so we need to have
14:21 a way of saying we have this this this
14:24 data right so this is one part of that
14:27 so actually having the data itself then
14:30 having the tools to access the data
14:32 right so there are tools to access the
14:34 data there are tools to catalog the data
14:36 and how people go about so the third
14:39 component you said processor so well
14:41 how people go about accessing the data
14:43 how people go about collecting the data
14:45 how people go about
14:46 storing the data and all that right did
14:49 they miss something
14:50 and i think you mentioned also banks so
14:53 in banks
14:54 that the rule of keeping the data for
14:56 seven years has been around for quite a
14:58 while
14:59 and this is one of the like that's
15:03 one of the data governance rules right
15:04 so they say okay we must keep the data
15:07 for seven years
15:07 so this is a rule they have to follow
15:09 and this is how they define
15:12 data governance right so they debut
15:14 that's a good example of
15:15 retention which is how long or how short
15:18 you retain the data is an example of a
15:20 data governance policy yes
15:22 okay we have a bunch of policies like
15:24 this and then collectively
15:26 they're told they're called data
15:28 governance right
15:30 okay good and uh
15:33 yeah so this actually this sounds
15:35 excellent right as uh
15:37 as a company i really want to have it i
15:38 want our analysts
15:40 to know what data we have and where this
15:43 data lies how to access this data
15:45 so how do i implement this what what do
15:47 i actually need to implement this
15:49 data governance so i i wanted to add a
15:53 little bit
15:54 um which will i think go to your
15:57 question so you were talking about like
15:59 there's these tools and the processes
16:01 and you were really hitting on
16:04 kind of the the process that the tools
16:06 have right like okay i'm an analyst
16:08 what tool do i use to find my data to
16:11 access it to run analytics
16:13 um but as uri was hitting on there's
16:17 also policies and this is also a part of
16:20 the process
16:21 right so there are you know
16:24 things that are policies of like okay
16:26 this is what we do with this kind of
16:28 data right
16:29 um you know like he was giving the
16:31 example with the banks this is
16:33 this kind of data we need to keep it for
16:35 seven years but there's also the process
16:37 around
16:38 like how do we ingest the data what do
16:40 we do once
16:41 it's ingested um and that's a big piece
16:44 that
16:44 often doesn't get done or doesn't get
16:48 done
16:48 well so when uri was talking about okay
16:51 everybody wants to collect
16:52 all this data so what a lot of companies
16:54 do is they just
16:55 collect it and dump it right let's just
16:57 dump it somewhere
16:59 in this big you know blob storage or
17:01 whatever um
17:03 and then we're gonna figure out what to
17:04 do with it later and i'm not saying that
17:06 there's
17:06 anything wrong with that but then you
17:08 need a process of how do i go through
17:09 that and then
17:10 find out what it is and then classify
17:14 this
17:15 so um and i know you had a question
17:18 um like we're probably going to talk
17:19 about data catalogs later so i'm
17:21 probably hitting on it a little bit
17:22 early
17:23 but if we're talking about how do i
17:24 implement data governance first
17:27 you first kind of have to start with
17:29 saying how do i want to classify my data
17:31 what are the different data classes that
17:33 i want to identify
17:35 of okay this is sensitive stuff this is
17:38 business critical
17:39 you know i mean even simple things of
17:41 like
17:43 like let's say that you have revenue
17:45 data and
17:47 depending on how you call it they might
17:49 be four different kinds right there
17:51 could be
17:52 roi there could be sales um
17:55 you know different kind of classes or
17:58 different kind of labels that you want
18:00 to clump together in a class
18:04 so really it's about defining what are
18:07 these different data classes that you
18:08 want to have
18:09 and going through your data to then map
18:13 what you have to these different classes
18:16 at least it's kind of a first starting
18:17 point um there's a lot more but uri did
18:19 you want to add on to
18:21 at least kind of this classification
18:22 part yeah
18:24 a little bit so again um
18:27 don't start uh it's with the time saying
18:30 that don't don't start from a
18:31 technocratic point of view like you want
18:34 to have data governance great
18:36 why why are you uh
18:39 subject to regulation are you
18:43 afraid of data exfiltration are you
18:47 in a business that requires you to have
18:50 a certain
18:51 liability or certain accountability to
18:55 customers
18:56 out of that uh like core reasoning which
18:59 may be multiples of those things
19:01 you need to as just to say now
19:03 understand as a business
19:05 i need to understand what
19:08 kinds of data do i hold on and then
19:10 jesse went into classification which is
19:13 a very
19:13 that that's the way to go about it and
19:16 then i
19:17 like why am i concerned about data
19:19 governance which means
19:20 what kinds of oh that relates to what
19:23 kinds of data do i want to
19:25 do something about and then the third
19:27 part which is what policies do i want to
19:29 put in place
19:30 in order to get to that why
19:34 answer and answer it with confidence um
19:36 that's very high level
19:38 uh the next step would be to pick yeah
19:40 cool
19:41 yeah so like you mentioned that uh you
19:44 know like we should ask ourselves why we
19:46 need data governance
19:47 so why before we implement this we need
19:50 to ask this why question
19:51 and i'm wondering if there are reasons
19:53 why we do not
19:55 we do not need it like maybe
19:58 like maybe it's just an overkill for us
19:59 maybe we're a small company
20:01 or we don't have that many analysts or
20:03 maybe we don't store sensitive data what
20:05 kind of reasons we can have not to have
20:08 it
20:09 so jesse uh mentioned a bit about
20:12 like data is valuable because otherwise
20:15 you wouldn't be collecting it right
20:16 um so if data is valuable
20:20 you pretty much want to make sure that
20:22 you know what you have
20:24 where it is and how to access it which
20:26 is the act of cataloging
20:28 which is an act of data governance
20:32 so i would argue back and i know that i
20:36 am
20:36 sort of like speaking from a very clear
20:38 interest but i would argue
20:40 just cataloging and understanding what
20:42 you have
20:43 is a step that clearly is in the path to
20:47 getting
20:47 insights and we i think we can agree if
20:50 not i'll try to convince you
20:51 that data insights from data are
20:53 valuable and you'll make your fish
20:55 business more efficient more slimline
20:58 identify new sources of revenues
21:00 that will be one answer uh jesse seems
21:03 to have more
21:06 yeah i i would completely agree um and
21:08 and this is kind of why we talked in the
21:10 beginning
21:10 of how broad of a definition of data
21:13 governance
21:15 that there is right and and you're right
21:17 i mean different companies are going to
21:18 have
21:19 different levels of intricacy
21:22 into their data governance program but
21:25 uh as uri said i think we would
21:27 vehemently argue that any company that
21:30 has data even if you've got five
21:32 employees versus
21:34 50 000 you still are going to need
21:37 some way of knowing what data you have
21:40 so that you can have
21:41 insight from it now maybe your processes
21:44 aren't going to be as complicated as say
21:46 a bank
21:46 right that is collecting a lot of
21:49 sensitive information and
21:51 in the the years that we've been doing
21:53 um research on companies there have been
21:55 some that are small
21:57 kind of cloud native they don't have a
21:58 whole lot of employees they don't
22:00 collect a whole lot of sensitive data
22:02 and their data governance program is a
22:04 lot less complicated
22:06 than let's say a very big financial
22:08 institution
22:10 that has many moving parts that they
22:12 have to think about many employees
22:15 um so you're right it can be a bit less
22:17 complicated but we would argue that no
22:19 matter
22:19 what if you have data at all you're
22:22 going to have to
22:23 you you would be best served
22:26 to think about how you're going to
22:29 um structure a governance program for
22:32 that data
22:34 so distilling it just adding a little
22:36 bit distilling it to an even base
22:38 motif like you collect data you store it
22:40 somewhere you
22:41 query it with some system that costs
22:44 money
22:45 so how do you know that the the money
22:47 that you pay for storage
22:49 and compute to like retain this data and
22:53 process this data
22:55 is actually doing something for you
22:57 that's data governance
22:58 yeah so it's not a question whether we
23:01 need
23:02 data governance or not we do need it
23:05 but the the why here the question we
23:08 should ask
23:09 ourselves is what is the reason we need
23:11 it so
23:12 it's clear we need it but why we need it
23:14 right it's not like
23:16 a decision between yes or no it's
23:18 decision between
23:20 okay what are the aspects what are the
23:23 problems we want to solve first
23:25 with this right before starting to
23:27 implement it
23:28 exactly exactly yeah you're totally
23:31 right and that's going to help you
23:32 figure out
23:34 how extensive of a data governance
23:37 program am i going to need and uri is
23:38 completely right you know you
23:40 yes you're going to need it but figuring
23:42 out that why is it because i'm
23:43 collecting a bunch of sensitive
23:45 data um am i going to need to show
23:47 regulators a certain something um
23:50 is business asking us for like you know
23:53 our t-shirt website right well
23:55 are there differences in fourth of july
23:57 versus other times do we need to
23:58 increase our supply chain
24:00 right so answering those kinds of
24:01 questions those are the things that help
24:03 you figure out
24:04 what parts of a data governance program
24:08 do i prioritize first you know
24:14 and i guess most of the time the answer
24:16 is data catalog
24:18 i need to know you need to have this
24:20 catalog of data you need to know what
24:22 kind of data you have
24:23 and you started that we need to classify
24:26 the data
24:27 so we need to know first of all what
24:29 kind of data sources we have and then
24:31 for each data source
24:32 uh we need to understand this
24:36 field in this data source is it uh
24:39 you know personally identifiable or not
24:42 is it like i think you mentioned
24:45 business critical
24:47 um so what kind of actually what kind of
24:49 classes can we have there
24:52 in addition to these two that's a good
24:54 question uri i think you're more
24:55 familiar with a lot of the different
24:58 classes so so the classes yes thank you
25:01 the classes of data really are not like
25:03 there's not like a preset
25:05 uh like dictionary of classes you use
25:08 for every purpose in every business
25:10 the classes of data are really defined
25:13 by
25:14 yourself there are examples of classes
25:16 of data which we'll go over
25:17 but they'll define by yourself as groups
25:20 of data i want to assign a specific
25:23 policy or a specific uh governing
25:26 method too here are common examples
25:29 banded about
25:30 in the industry one is we already
25:32 mentioned pii
25:34 uh we mentioned pii because the european
25:36 regulator really made the point
25:38 of like you must suffer pii separate pi
25:41 from
25:42 other kinds of data pii is personally
25:44 identified information
25:45 that can be as jesse mentioned earlier a
25:47 phone number which can clearly identify
25:49 you in this day where everybody has a
25:51 phone
25:52 or a phone hardware number or an address
25:55 or
25:56 name and it actually depends on the
25:58 kinds of business you are
26:00 because in some businesses you may be
26:02 collecting uh
26:03 names and addresses but not in an
26:05 identifiable manner maybe
26:08 google offices is an address for example
26:10 but it doesn't
26:11 identify people there's like i don't
26:13 know how many thousands people working
26:15 there
26:16 um there's special health information
26:18 which has been
26:19 around also for a long time and it's the
26:22 demographics of the patient
26:24 the uh kinds of treatments that patient
26:27 is having the
26:29 the success of those treatments and
26:31 especially in medicine by the way
26:33 uh in medical research since we all went
26:36 to an interesting year
26:38 the sensitivity of uh treatments on a
26:42 specific person which can identify
26:44 them and maybe things they don't want uh
26:48 a processor of medical information to
26:51 know are actually very useful in
26:53 determining
26:54 the possible success of a treatment and
26:56 uh
26:57 we have obvious recent examples so
26:59 patient health information
27:01 personally identified formation fiscal
27:04 information so
27:05 list of transactions and amounts and
27:09 so on um there's other
27:12 classes of data but really uh when you
27:16 try
27:16 as we are talking to potentially people
27:18 who want to start a governance program
27:20 don't subscribe to a like outside
27:24 defined uh classes of data think about
27:27 your business think about what data you
27:30 possess
27:31 and think about how you would like to
27:32 control make accessible
27:34 delete that data that's how you should
27:37 think about it there are examples
27:39 we literally wrote a book um but
27:43 think about yourself not about outsiders
27:47 yeah yes and when it comes to
27:50 implementing this
27:51 data catalog so i can already imagine
27:53 that if i just
27:54 or create an excel spreadsheet or
27:58 google spreadsheet and then start
27:59 putting all the data sources there
28:01 all the fields all the classes that is
28:04 probably a reasonably good start but i
28:07 guess that's not
28:08 always the best tool there are better
28:10 ones do you
28:12 do you know if there is something
28:14 available that can help us that
28:16 is a purpose built for this
28:19 for this purpose
28:23 yes there are many uh
28:27 areas laughing because there are many
28:30 many many
28:31 tools um and uri i'm sure you have
28:34 a a lot of opinions on this so i guess
28:37 the the thing that i'll start with
28:39 saying
28:39 is that um
28:42 there are there are so many tools and
28:45 people create a lot of their own tools
28:47 um but i think one of the important
28:49 things is to really think about
28:51 the future right so how scalable
28:55 is what you're doing is it going to have
28:57 to scale
28:58 enormously because one of the problems
29:00 we've seen folks have is that
29:02 data governance especially if we're
29:04 talking about cataloging
29:06 classifying i mean if you're even
29:08 thinking about doing this as an excel
29:09 spreadsheet that is so
29:11 manual right and as we've talked to
29:15 companies
29:16 where data governance often fails
29:19 is because it's so manual and there
29:22 isn't somebody to do that
29:24 in fact we had talked to a company a
29:25 couple years ago
29:27 who had a full-time uh data steward you
29:29 know so a person whose sole job
29:31 was to catalog classify do all this kind
29:35 of stuff
29:35 um and that person quit because they
29:38 said the job was and i quote soul
29:39 sucking
29:40 so true true story i'm not lying
29:45 um and you know so most other companies
29:48 we we've talked to
29:49 is they don't have a single person who's
29:51 doing this job
29:52 and so um i think the takeaway from that
29:55 is to just think about
29:57 whatever process you're going to start
30:00 think about how how can i keep this
30:03 going
30:04 who's going to be doing this work and am
30:06 i setting up a process
30:08 that is just um
30:11 so time consuming and and so arduous
30:13 that it's going to be really difficult
30:15 to keep going
30:17 uh uri i want to
30:20 i want to double down on a lot of what
30:22 just he said
30:23 so so alex say what you discussed
30:26 is really okay i need to get data
30:28 governance i'll open this spreadsheet
30:30 i'll start inputting
30:31 i will work for my data if you work for
30:34 your data
30:35 something is wrong there from the start
30:37 the data should work for you
30:39 not the other way around and that's
30:41 actually that's not my
30:43 metaphor that's uh one of the analysts
30:45 that's worked today like make data work
30:47 for you is what data governance is about
30:50 but but think about it this way you need
30:53 the data governance program
30:54 program that probably means you have
30:57 data
30:58 somewhere which you process and uh which
31:01 you stole
31:01 okay where is the data right now this is
31:04 something
31:04 you should know because you pay for that
31:06 storage every day okay
31:08 what systems do i already have
31:12 that uh tell me something about my data
31:15 then take those systems and it's just he
31:17 said extend
31:19 your timeline into the future five years
31:22 ten years
31:22 see like is this place where i stole the
31:25 data
31:26 right now am i happy about it is it
31:28 performant is it scalable is it
31:31 more or less future proof okay what
31:33 systems
31:34 do i have that integrate into this
31:36 system today i'm going to do
31:37 a little bit of a shameless plug here uh
31:40 when you use
31:41 a platform such as google cloud
31:44 we have tools already built in to the
31:47 platform
31:48 uh to support a lot of the basic
31:50 workflows and basic needs we
31:53 google cloud has a google cloud catalog
31:56 which automatically as you drop data in
31:58 other
31:58 file storage or columnar storage
32:01 assesses the data and indexes it because
32:05 we are also known for being a search
32:07 company and
32:08 uh allows you to like find what you need
32:11 that's great
32:12 that's a free starting point you can
32:14 have today
32:15 now uh to be fair other clouds have
32:18 similar systems
32:19 so uh just assess your situation right
32:23 now
32:23 then if you need to fi to buy a
32:26 specialized tool
32:27 again don't work for your data
32:30 what do you need next that is not
32:33 satisfied
32:34 with your existing infrastructure and
32:36 the way to look at it is i can go back
32:38 to the why
32:39 why do i need data governance i need to
32:41 comply with regulation
32:42 or i need to extract more insights or
32:45 i need to be wary about exfiltration
32:49 there are tools that are built around
32:52 those concepts
32:53 evaluate them in light of your current
32:56 and future goals
32:58 and then decide now do do you did you
33:01 want a
33:01 is like concrete uh like if you are a
33:05 do this kind of uh thing that's more of
33:08 a conversation that
33:10 is very different for each particular
33:12 company in each particular
33:13 vertical i'm sorry if that's a little
33:16 bit disappointing though
33:19 so what i understood is starting with an
33:21 excel spreadsheet maybe is not ideal
33:23 because
33:24 at the end the person who needs to
33:25 maintain it will quit because it's a
33:27 sole second job
33:29 then then you need to make
33:32 data work for you and there are tools
33:35 who actually go there look at your data
33:37 and
33:38 [Music]
33:39 organize and organize it yes but i guess
33:42 the this manual component this
33:44 human component will not go away because
33:46 at the end you still need to make a
33:48 decision
33:48 if this particular field is personal or
33:51 not
33:52 personal identifiable or not is this
33:54 particular
33:55 field is business critical or not so
33:57 there still needs to be a person
33:59 who looks at this and makes this
34:00 classification right and
34:02 even more importantly like okay this
34:04 particular field is personal or not
34:06 fine what do you do with personal data
34:09 that can only come
34:10 from a human do you delete it do you uh
34:13 encrypt it
34:14 do you allow it to be accessible only by
34:16 certain people
34:18 uh that's most definitely a human
34:20 component
34:21 and that's the human that the data works
34:24 for
34:25 and then data doesn't stand still it
34:27 evolves right
34:28 we add new fields we remove fields we
34:30 add new data sources
34:32 so i guess somebody still needs to keep
34:34 track like even though
34:36 like a system could be automatically
34:37 synchronizing with the data sources and
34:39 say okay there is a new field hey
34:41 and then maybe there is a pop-up or
34:43 email saying
34:44 hey data steward please take a look at
34:47 this field
34:48 or the team who is responsible for
34:50 producing the data
34:51 at the end somebody needs to go there
34:54 and
34:55 do a manual action right we just need to
34:58 make
34:58 this process we talked a lot
35:02 about like binary uh binary concepts
35:05 like is this data
35:07 a or b is uh this column protected or
35:10 not should this be accessible to
35:12 this person or not there's also some uh
35:16 like fuzzy concepts in data governance
35:18 one of which
35:19 is data quality and data quality is a
35:23 little bit more elusive it's like
35:24 this data source that contains
35:26 personally identifiable information
35:29 that is entering through this system and
35:31 going to that system
35:33 do i trust it uh is it high quality
35:36 enough to be used in the machine
35:38 learning model
35:39 is it high quality enough to make a
35:41 business decision alone
35:43 this is a little bit more of a tricky
35:45 concept which is also part of data
35:47 governance we can talk a little bit
35:48 about that
35:49 yeah i'm wondering uh yeah this is an
35:52 interesting discussion like
35:54 how do you know if this data is high
35:55 quality is because the analyst working
35:58 and that
35:59 team said so or so so the
36:03 mechanic ways to understand quality
36:06 and uh like more elusive ways so first
36:09 of all
36:09 what's the source of the data that will
36:11 be like is the source of the data
36:14 and i have this insurance company i'm
36:16 working on they have proudly
36:18 mentioned that they are at world 3.0
36:21 now and i'm like what does that mean and
36:23 they're like
36:24 we are now at the stage where we have
36:26 processed most of the handwritten data
36:28 and we are now reading data written in
36:31 microsoft word 3.0 so that's probably
36:34 1990s and or
36:37 slightly later but not much later and we
36:41 are
36:41 making our way through the backlog so is
36:44 that data
36:45 that potentially some of it's
36:47 handwritten can that be used today
36:50 in making a decision about the mortgage
36:52 because it's an insurance company
36:54 uh that's an interesting question only
36:56 somebody who's familiar with the entry
36:58 no is this data that's coming from an
37:01 oil rig
37:02 where transmission is iffy and there's a
37:05 lot of
37:05 noise on the communication channel
37:08 should i be using that
37:09 in order to uh determine
37:12 gas leaks that's somebody was familiar
37:15 then there's like
37:16 okay this data source is the combination
37:20 of merging
37:21 uh data sources a and b for which i do
37:23 have a quality signal
37:24 what's the derivative quality signal
37:27 those are the if that that are technical
37:29 you can detect
37:29 uh like out of bound values missing
37:32 fields
37:33 uh like uh error in rows
37:37 those are more technical practices that
37:39 you can implement uh
37:40 fairly easily and also give you a
37:42 quality signal
37:44 so basically it is up to the team or
37:48 whoever
37:48 up to the producer of the date to say
37:51 because they have a domain expert a
37:52 business expert
37:54 like somebody from insurance or somebody
37:56 from this oil ring
37:58 who can say okay this data can be
38:01 trusted but this data is easy
38:03 right so we still need to trust the team
38:06 the producer
38:07 who created you can implement a lot of
38:09 tools that give you
38:10 a leg up uh but i would argue that the
38:14 final decision
38:16 of trust should be handled by a human
38:19 still we are still useful there's future
38:22 hope
38:25 so okay so we have the data sources
38:28 right so we have the data storage
38:30 where we put data it can be a data lake
38:32 or whatever database house so we have
38:34 some place where we keep the data then
38:37 we have this data catalog
38:38 which might also communicate with our
38:41 data storage
38:42 and get all this information from there
38:44 we have a data steward who maintains the
38:46 data catalog
38:47 and knows what's going on there one or
38:49 multiple
38:50 so what else do we need to when it comes
38:53 to tools and
38:54 practices what else do we need to
38:55 implement for
38:57 data governance so
39:00 i think that the next step and we had
39:02 kind of talked about this a little bit
39:04 is the policies that you then have
39:07 on these classifications right
39:10 so once you have your data classes now
39:13 you're going to have to define
39:14 okay what do i do with those right are
39:17 there certain ones that need to stay
39:19 in this kind of storage certain ones
39:21 that um as already said need to be kept
39:23 for seven years
39:24 um ones that are business critical that
39:26 we should be using um
39:28 ones that it matters very much the
39:29 freshness of the data
39:31 right um so the these policies and and
39:35 they can be very
39:36 i just listed a lot of ones that are
39:38 very straightforward
39:39 um and as we've done more research into
39:42 policies and i'm sure the listeners
39:44 uh will will agree is
39:48 that they are a lot more complicated
39:50 than we
39:51 had originally thought of just okay
39:53 here's a simple policy
39:54 um you know only allow access
39:58 of this data for for these folks
40:01 and one of the use cases we've heard
40:03 recently is
40:04 well depending on the purpose somebody
40:08 is accessing this data for that might
40:11 change who can have access so we heard
40:14 an example from a company that sells
40:16 furniture
40:17 and they had said you know okay let's
40:19 say um that we have somebody's email
40:21 address because they bought a couch and
40:24 we're going to ship them
40:25 the couch so you know the the person who
40:28 is you know handling these shipping
40:31 addresses and everything they can have
40:33 access to that data
40:34 but now let's say that we have a sale on
40:37 couch covers or something and we'd like
40:39 to be able to market this to folks who
40:41 have recently bought a couch
40:43 well if someone and it could even be
40:45 that same analyst right
40:47 they cannot access that email address
40:50 for that marketing purpose unless that
40:52 customer explicitly gave permission
40:55 so there's even these nuances in um
40:58 in policies that you know how do i
41:00 create a policy that's going to capture
41:02 that nuance
41:03 of for this particular use case of this
41:07 data
41:07 that it can't be used for that um so i
41:11 guess where i'm going with this
41:12 is that um you know once you have your
41:16 classes you're going to have to think
41:17 about what do i
41:18 do with those um and what policies am i
41:21 going to
41:22 put on this and as uri had said at the
41:24 very beginning
41:25 this all goes back to your why right if
41:28 you know and
41:29 and this is the way that you can figure
41:30 out i don't want to say minimal
41:32 governance but what are the key things
41:34 that i really need to care about
41:36 um if regulations are you know top of
41:39 mind and that's the most important then
41:41 my policy should really fall in line
41:43 with that because as you can see you can
41:44 go down like a million rabbit holes
41:46 of you know govern this govern that you
41:49 know classify this classify that
41:51 policies
41:51 um so really being able to map back to
41:54 what do i have to do like what do i have
41:57 to do what's the most important
41:59 and starting there with your policies um
42:01 or did you want to add to
42:04 yeah a bit um so so adding to what jesse
42:07 said
42:08 the next step as jesse said is like you
42:10 have organized your data you've
42:11 understood your data you've
42:13 attached tags to further understand and
42:15 index your data
42:16 and now you're into okay what is allowed
42:19 to do with my data and just to describe
42:21 a couple of policies
42:23 uh the way i like to think about this
42:26 being inspired by our customers is
42:29 policies are not thou shalt not or
42:32 doubts
42:33 shell those are not those should not be
42:35 thought of as prescriptive
42:37 policies like uh should answer the
42:40 question
42:40 how do i make sure the cio the
42:44 ciso the ceo feel comfortable
42:47 about everybody in the company accessing
42:49 this data
42:50 and the way to make those people those
42:53 sea sweet people feel comfortable
42:55 is saying okay anybody can access the
42:57 data but only this specific group
43:00 can access personally identifiable data
43:03 or we make sure to scrub away any
43:06 location information it never
43:08 even enters our system and therefore the
43:10 data is safe
43:11 those guardrails enable democratization
43:15 of the data
43:16 and enable people to extract insights
43:19 and the tricky thing about insight again
43:21 is you don't know what you don't know so
43:24 you may not know that all of the
43:26 playback
43:27 events of the music app that you of the
43:31 list are
43:31 valuable but then suddenly a year later
43:34 you go over those and you realize that
43:36 you can predict
43:38 uh trends in music and that's valuable
43:40 because then you can replenish your
43:42 catalog and then you can
43:43 basically make more attractive music off
43:46 the links
43:47 um there's mechanisms in place that
43:51 now we are talking about tooling that
43:52 allow you to do so jesse mentioned how
43:55 you can make
43:56 email available for everyone but make
43:58 sure
43:59 that when somebody accesses data they
44:01 are test purpose
44:02 then they can very easily mass mail
44:04 about the new couches
44:06 and the system makes sure that
44:09 only those people who opted in for email
44:12 communications will actually get
44:14 uh the notification of a new culture i
44:16 guess
44:17 uh there's other things like for example
44:20 training machine learning
44:22 models many machine learning models
44:24 don't need
44:25 the personal email they do need a way to
44:28 identify this is person a this is person
44:32 b
44:32 so hashing the email in a one-way
44:35 function which is still
44:37 uh still um
44:41 so one-way hash that is still unique
44:44 will make sure that you don't expose any
44:46 personal information
44:48 but still you can differentiate between
44:50 humans to do things like
44:52 count distinct and aggregate by
44:55 and so on which will create a hopefully
44:58 useful machine learning model to predict
45:00 shopping plans yep
45:04 uh these policies like what it can be
45:06 accessed what cannot be accessed
45:08 is it something how many things we
45:10 access how yes like which team can
45:12 access
45:13 for example how exactly uh should it be
45:16 hashed information or not hashed
45:18 is it something that is implemented on
45:20 top of the catalog
45:22 or is it built into the catalog or how
45:25 does it usually
45:26 look in practice so there are variations
45:30 there's some systems that says a you
45:33 should access
45:33 all data through the catalog the catalog
45:36 will normalize
45:36 everything the catalog will be your
45:38 workbench and the catalog
45:40 also cares for how the data is shaped
45:43 before you see it sort of like maintains
45:45 those guidelines
45:46 that that's one approach the thing i
45:48 like about this approach
45:50 is um it is
45:53 a certain choke point for governance
45:55 that
45:56 is sort of by equalizing all the data
45:58 the downside of the system
46:00 is it puts a constraint about the tools
46:03 you can use
46:04 you can only use the catalog as an
46:06 interface or tools that
46:07 interface with the catalog again
46:11 being a little bit biased here but i
46:13 would uh
46:14 correct towards a system that make sure
46:17 the actual storage system
46:19 implements the governance with essential
46:21 control plane and the dashboard and so
46:23 on
46:24 but but having the storage implement
46:27 governance
46:28 means you can use any tool that can
46:30 access the storage
46:32 and still be safe and that
46:35 like opens up compatibility with much
46:37 more tooling
46:38 again at the end of the day nobody
46:41 should be maybe
46:42 besides like just see data storage which
46:44 hopefully we made much happier
46:46 um nobody should be
46:50 working uh to figure out the guardrails
46:53 the guidelines should be invisible
46:55 and enable you to use whatever tool you
46:57 want to do to generate
46:58 the business purpose you came to the
47:00 data for
47:02 but i guess there should be some central
47:05 place
47:06 where i as an analyst or i is a data
47:09 scientist can
47:10 go and say i need this piece of data
47:13 and then somebody a lawyer or data
47:15 protection officer or
47:16 data producer can evaluate my request
47:19 and say okay
47:21 maybe you don't really need this data
47:22 use this instead or okay yeah like your
47:24 use case is valid
47:25 here this is uh now the access is
47:28 granted right so we need a tool that
47:30 allows that and
47:31 should it be on top of the catalog or
47:34 elsewhere
47:35 so so it can be on top of the catalog it
47:39 can be
47:39 on top of the storage it can be agnostic
47:42 to actually
47:43 both so so we recently launched a
47:45 product called
47:46 dataplex again being biased but still as
47:48 a good example
47:50 dataplex actually sits besides all the
47:52 storage systems in google
47:54 and basically tells you hey uh these
47:57 users have access to this data
47:59 are you happy about this this data is
48:02 accessible for these users
48:04 are you happy about that uh there are
48:06 systems thoughts
48:07 just to give a shout out to coliba for
48:10 example which is
48:12 a data catalog data governance system
48:14 which is the third party
48:16 they implement a shopping cart
48:19 experience really
48:20 which is exactly as you described like
48:22 say it's like i
48:23 need the financial information for the
48:26 last two years
48:27 in order to perform for the analysis and
48:29 i searched for financial information in
48:31 the last two years
48:32 i'm presented with certain uh data mods
48:35 and i can
48:36 request access to that and you get like
48:38 a shopping cart experience with
48:40 authorizing and
48:41 auditing which is another concept of
48:43 data governance
48:44 which records this transaction which is
48:47 also
48:48 important i think one thing to add to
48:52 is that um alexi a lot of what you were
48:55 describing
48:57 it's manual too right and and as uri
49:00 said there's
49:00 i mean you have to have people involved
49:02 right that that is going to be important
49:04 but again this is another place to think
49:06 about
49:08 how much of this can i sort of automate
49:10 or or make
49:11 easier for myself and i think this is
49:13 kind of what erie is getting at too if
49:14 my storage system can implement some of
49:16 this if my data catalog can implement
49:18 some of this of
49:19 you know i i've classified my data and
49:21 now i've added tags
49:23 and these tags do certain things with
49:25 the data then it doesn't become
49:27 always on the onus of the data producer
49:30 or something you know an analyst oh we i
49:32 mean we've talked to a lot of
49:33 data producers or you know data
49:35 engineers who are like oh man
49:37 like i like spend so much of my time
49:41 having to deal with requests of analysts
49:43 and data scientists wanting this data
49:45 set
49:46 why do you need it you know and then i
49:47 give it to them and then they don't use
49:49 it and now i got to do another one
49:50 so i'm i'm sure many people are familiar
49:53 with that so
49:54 the more systems you know when you're
49:56 kind of thinking about this process that
49:58 you can
49:59 implement that will help make some of
50:02 that stuff
50:02 not so manual whether if that's a tool
50:05 that you use or just the way that you've
50:07 classified it and tagged it um that will
50:09 help you also
50:14 thank you yeah we have a question
50:16 actually from uh
50:19 so it's also about the data catalog so
50:22 how
50:22 can we systematically evaluate data
50:25 governance initiatives such as having a
50:27 data catalog
50:28 for data access so how can we
50:31 prove their value to to the business
50:36 but that's a good question i i would go
50:39 back
50:40 to the business objectives okay
50:43 and start at the highest level okay you
50:45 are storing a lot of data
50:48 you are spending efforts and compute
50:51 resources which also cost money on
50:53 processing this data
50:54 here's a question which can easily be
50:57 answered with the catalog and easily
50:58 addresses
50:59 like what is the relationship between
51:03 the money you spend on storing the data
51:07 and the uh usage
51:10 of that data a catalog can answer that
51:12 question and the catalog can show you
51:14 the most used tables and so on and then
51:17 you can make decisions such as
51:19 hey you know what this is a lot of
51:21 alcohol data nobody is touching
51:23 let's move it to cold storage which is
51:25 cheaper
51:26 uh that could be one way that there's
51:28 the also
51:29 uh other way which is uh like i'm
51:32 subject to regulation
51:34 uh this regulation can take a bite out
51:37 of my revenues if i don't comply
51:39 so how do i move easily cheaply
51:43 without like every time there's an audit
51:45 going into a lot of manual label
51:47 that i comply that will be another
51:49 approach still
51:50 justin do you have a couple more yeah um
51:54 i i would say i mean i think to add on
51:56 to uri's approaches i think that's
51:58 absolutely right and you know not to
52:00 like beat a dead horse but if you kind
52:02 of go back to the original
52:04 what governance do i need i i think a
52:07 lot of times folks look at okay well i
52:08 got to have this entire governance
52:10 program
52:11 and i need all these tools and and this
52:13 storage and all this head count and it's
52:15 super complicated super expensive right
52:18 and and kind of your
52:19 your c-suite's like hell no that's way
52:21 too much we're not going to do that and
52:23 i think oftentimes that's where this
52:24 question comes from
52:26 but if you can look at what's the
52:28 minimum and i
52:29 like you know we we wrote a book on this
52:32 so obviously we don't think data
52:33 governance should be like a bare minimum
52:35 thing but
52:36 if you're trying to implement something
52:39 you got to start
52:40 somewhere and looking at what's that
52:42 minimum that i can do
52:44 um that doesn't require a huge amount of
52:46 head count that doesn't require a lot of
52:48 manual stuff that's not a ton of
52:50 expensive tools
52:51 is a place to start and as uri said once
52:54 you can start doing some of these things
52:56 you can start showing the value of okay
52:58 we have all this data now we're able to
53:00 get more insights from it and then it
53:01 will start to sell itself
53:03 and then you can see how do i uh expand
53:06 from there
53:08 how to find this minimum
53:12 say again how to find this minimum so we
53:14 need to find this minimum
53:16 or minimum thing so how do we do this
53:21 again look at your business objectives
53:24 like i need the data governance spoken
53:26 fine because regulation because insights
53:30 because
53:30 things then uh the determining
53:34 from your objective what you need to
53:37 solve for
53:38 successfully will be that minimum the
53:42 maximum will be how do i solve this in a
53:45 way
53:45 which is future proof caters for
53:47 potentially buying other business units
53:49 or accumulating 10x data from
53:52 yx sources will be the maximum
53:55 uh that's the difference between
53:57 planning for now
53:58 and planning for the future as a general
54:01 approach
54:02 that's always like in the world of lean
54:04 startups you need to
54:06 plan for now plus 1x uh
54:10 because you don't want to be surprised
54:12 that will be
54:13 a way to look at this okay that makes
54:15 sense so basically
54:17 you for the first iteration you plan as
54:20 much as possible for now
54:22 give yourself uh like a bit of uh
54:26 allow yourself to also plan for the
54:27 future a bit but don't be so ambitious
54:30 and then prove that this thing is
54:31 valuable and only then
54:33 expand right yep
54:36 thank you so we have a question from
54:38 danish um
54:40 could you please explain a bit with
54:42 examples what a data catalog could
54:44 contain
54:45 and how we can leverage it i guess we
54:47 talked a bit about it like a couple of
54:49 like some data sources
54:51 and uh yeah so what can it contain as
54:55 well
54:56 here is what i wanted data catalog to do
54:58 for me uh
54:59 i wanted data catalog so so there's a
55:01 lot of technical metadata information
55:03 associated with data table names
55:06 data set names column names let's begin
55:08 with that collect all that
55:10 index all of that do it without or with
55:13 as little much
55:14 effort for me saying okay i have a new
55:17 table
55:18 now i need to go to the data catalog and
55:20 register that table
55:22 that becomes that becomes this manual
55:25 label
55:25 like say you mentioned earlier i i don't
55:28 think anybody wants a data catalog that
55:30 works
55:31 basically creates more work for you so
55:33 let's begin with it
55:34 then the better data catalog actually
55:37 extract
55:38 a logical layer or business layer on top
55:42 of this technical information which is
55:44 okay a lot of my data contains
55:46 information about customer
55:48 here's a customer entity it includes
55:50 these kinds of things
55:52 and customer entities can be found
55:55 in these systems in these data sets
55:58 in these tables that catalogs also
56:03 usually care for lineage of the data so
56:05 that's another kind of metadata which
56:07 says
56:07 where the data came from where the the
56:10 data is going next in terms of both
56:12 analyzing your sql data warehouse
56:15 as well as analyzing other flows of data
56:18 in and out of your
56:19 organization obviously we want to be
56:22 able to search rather than list
56:24 uh all of this data and uh
56:28 the the many so those are like the core
56:31 things the those features i see in many
56:35 partners for example democratizing data
56:37 quality is an
56:38 interesting trend people can five star
56:41 certain data sets if they are happy with
56:43 them or not
56:45 shopping cloud experience which we
56:46 mentioned earlier policy management
56:49 is sometimes part of data catalog
56:51 sometimes not because you already have a
56:52 view of your data
56:54 additional business metadata inclusion
56:57 is something that
56:59 um uh is part of many data catalogs it's
57:02 like i don't only want to know there's a
57:03 customer entity
57:05 i want to add to that customer entity
57:08 information about
57:09 is this a internal customer or an
57:11 external customer
57:13 information that maybe only humans know
57:16 those are things that
57:19 are normally found in a catalog
57:22 and again think about the catalog as the
57:24 dictionary that leads you to all of your
57:26 data
57:26 where it is and what it means so you go
57:29 from
57:30 uh a table in a data set in
57:33 a query engine to what does this table
57:36 mean
57:36 where did it come from who uses it uh
57:39 how often is it can you use
57:41 so that will be the kind of information
57:43 it's in a that
57:44 it's in a catalog yeah thank you
57:48 and i i think most of the time today we
57:50 spend talking about
57:51 uh data catalog i don't i know that we
57:54 have only one minute left
57:56 and i'm just wondering uh is it
57:59 all about having this data catalog or
58:02 there are other things that
58:04 are important so we talked about uh
58:08 even more basic concepts as well like
58:11 data is stored somewhere
58:12 so that's uh something the catalog often
58:15 scrapes
58:16 data is processed somewhere either data
58:18 warehouse or data analytics engine
58:20 or an open source tool those are things
58:24 that are part of your strategy
58:26 a policy engine which is either part of
58:29 the storage system or a data catalog
58:31 data catalog
58:32 sort of became synonymous
58:35 with data governance because it's a tool
58:39 very often used by two groups data
58:41 analysts and data stewards
58:43 each of them have a kind of a different
58:44 purpose in mind one is
58:46 understanding the data in order to query
58:48 it and the other is
58:49 understanding the data in order to
58:51 govern it
58:53 and that's why a lot of data governance
58:55 tools that exist there
58:56 sort of like our in the catalog or have
58:59 catalog
59:00 as a part of it
59:05 yeah so we should be wrapping up
59:07 anything else you want to mention
59:09 before we finish uh thank you for having
59:13 us this was great yeah
59:14 yeah this is fun any tips
59:18 or i don't know read the book
59:21 yeah okay
59:24 yeah that's the most important one
59:28 okay so how can people find you if they
59:31 have questions
59:34 um i know we're both on linkedin um
59:38 that's probably at least for me the
59:40 easiest way
59:43 and just seeing sometimes i do a lot of
59:45 talks
59:46 so uh linkedin twitter
59:49 the normal communications channels we
59:51 all have
59:52 yeah okay yeah well thanks a lot
59:56 for joining us today for sharing your
59:58 knowledge and thanks everyone else for
1:00:00 joining and listening for asking
1:00:01 questions
1:00:03 and uh yeah i guess that's all
1:00:06 have a great weekend and uh see you next
1:00:10 week
1:00:12 the uh and
1:00:15 our viewers
1:00:19 thank you very much and thank you all
1:00:21 who are watching i'm sure alex i will
1:00:23 contain our uh contact details in the
1:00:25 summary for this content
1:00:26 yes linkedin i don't think i have your
1:00:30 twitter but if you
1:00:31 give me i'll include this as well sure
1:00:35 yes thank you it's great a great day and
1:00:37 have a great weekend
1:00:38 thanks you too bye
