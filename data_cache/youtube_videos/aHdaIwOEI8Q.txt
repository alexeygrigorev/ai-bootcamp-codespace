1:32 oops
1:35 sorry okay I think I'm ready are you
1:38 ready great let's do
1:42 this okay so this week we'll talk about
1:46 volunteering and open source work and we
1:49 have a special guest today Sarah Sarah
1:51 is a Google developer expert in machine
1:54 learning a Google PhD fellow and also a
1:57 co-founder of AI Wonder Girls she likes
2:00 to demystify AI to empower individuals
2:02 with tools mindsets that require to
2:05 build solution that matter to their
2:06 community and
2:09 Humanity so and we met with Sarah in
2:13 October I think was was it October on a
2:16 conference in Porto it was an amazing
2:18 conference we had a very nice chat and
2:21 then Sarah was talking about what she
2:23 does and then I thought she would be an
2:25 amazing guest and here we are 3 four
2:28 five months after that finally so yeah
2:32 welcome to the interview thank
2:37 you so the questions for today's
2:39 interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer
2:42 as always thanks Johanna for help and
2:45 before we start before we go into our
2:47 main topic of Open Source work
2:51 volunteering let's start with your
2:53 background can you tell us about your
2:55 career Journey so far yeah sure so I got
2:58 interested in a in my first engineering
3:01 Year back in
3:03 2016 we were like part of a interesting
3:07 a joury called Beyond
3:10 engineering educational engineering
3:13 where we had to contribute our skills
3:15 our engineering skills to help the
3:18 locals and that's actually what pushed
3:21 me to kind of like start going this
3:23 volunteering road because I enjoyed it
3:26 so much giving back the community and my
3:28 skills that I wanted to do it as well
3:31 but from there I started learning about
3:33 what AI is and obviously like everyone I
3:35 started with andrein course machine
3:38 learning from Stanford and that's how
3:41 you know after that I got into the udity
3:44 a deep learning bip partur so on and so
3:46 forth and then like by the side I was
3:49 volunteering my skills with amena with
3:51 fruit punch Ai and then got an
3:53 interesting internship from Stu and
3:56 that's how I actually like got to where
3:58 I am now
4:00 doing my PhD in in in AI applied to help
4:04 and one of the reasons why I actually
4:05 wanted to do a PhD was to get a deep
4:08 learning
4:09 research um you know like applied
4:12 research in industry and obviously if
4:14 you're going to be doing research you do
4:16 kind of need some kind of you know
4:18 research intensive that's a PhD for
4:22 you and what is your background what was
4:24 your studies about yeah so actually in
4:27 our engineering we were doing computer
4:29 comp
4:30 science and uh our our like major was
4:34 called computer science and emerging
4:36 Technologies engineering and in our last
4:39 year I did a big data engineering
4:43 specialization and then you liked it and
4:45 you wanted to do more Ai and this is
4:49 yeah I had like an inter I had in in
4:52 that same year like in
4:54 2017 uh I was interested I was actually
4:57 part of a big data challenge by
5:00 Tre like e um double sorry Triple E I
5:05 always M it
5:06 up and that's like when we did that
5:09 internship I was like I really want to
5:10 do this you know I was en numbered by
5:12 computer vision because I'm a vision
5:13 person most of the time and that's how
5:15 like I got interested in computer vision
5:18 and then from computer vision I was
5:19 really interested in the medical field I
5:21 watch a lot of medical dramas that's how
5:24 I wanted to do AI applied to H in
5:28 my what
5:30 Grace Anatomy oh I kind of like watched
5:33 that but that wasn't my first choice I
5:35 usually prefer cadr when it comes to
5:37 doctor dramas because they're more
5:40 thorough less
5:45 fluffy yeah I also know scrubs but I
5:47 guess it's also not really a very
5:50 medical artifici show
5:53 right okay so your focus is on um Ai and
5:58 Healthcare right yes yes so what is your
6:02 PhD about it's about deep multimodality
6:06 learning for co9 and ey diseases
6:09 diagnosis practically I am trying a
6:12 bunch of CNN models and vision
6:14 Transformers and I Max and M like mat
6:18 like depending on the disease different
6:20 modalities for example for covid just
6:23 x-ray with CT I feed them to the CNN or
6:27 the models I'm comparing right to do a
6:30 benchmark and see which models
6:32 outperforms and Which models for example
6:35 which modality is actually much more
6:38 efficient for a certain model than
6:40 another why and is it normal like for
6:44 example is it what doctors usually rely
6:46 upon more than the other for example
6:49 modality available the other modalities
6:51 that's practically like in simple words
6:54 what I'm
6:55 doing and for how long have you been
6:57 doing this oh this is like my for year
6:59 normally this is my final year I'm just
7:01 wrapping up the writing
7:04 part final year okay so now you you're
7:07 almost um finished right yes no no I
7:12 finished I haven't like done any
7:14 experimentation for um like a year
7:17 almost a year yeah so you've been
7:20 writing papers for a year no that's more
7:24 like I have been working papers from the
7:26 start of my PhD like my first paper was
7:29 ready by I believe it was um November or
7:34 something it was ready ready and then it
7:37 was circulating around
7:39 journals because like by the way that's
7:42 like the paper that was published just
7:44 recently just last year and it was the
7:46 first paper that was written like all
7:48 the other papers have already been
7:50 published but it was still roaming
7:52 around ah so it took a bit of time yeah
7:55 for the you also a Google PhD fellow yes
7:58 what does it mean and how did you get it
8:02 get this yeah yeah so actually like one
8:05 of the one of the things we don't have
8:06 in Morocco sadly for now we don't have
8:08 funding for research so one of the
8:12 things I had to do was like find a funer
8:14 source in a scholarship or something to
8:16 kind of like help me support my studies
8:19 that's kind of how I was like way before
8:22 that I was involved in a lot of Google
8:24 stuff like with the gdgs Google
8:26 developers groups so I knew there was
8:28 they had had a program called cucko PhD
8:31 Fellowship I applied to it I
8:35 like what can I tell you the things like
8:37 if you want to play play to it and you
8:38 want to have chances to be selected
8:40 please make sure that you focus on
8:42 something they care about so for example
8:44 try to figure out what they're
8:45 researching especially for example a
8:47 sear field if you're doing it for
8:48 healthcare try to figure out what
8:50 they're interested in and then the
8:52 second thing it has to touch up sdg
8:56 goal like helping you or your community
8:59 and it has to help your community that
9:02 means if you're in Morocco or if you're
9:04 in a 13 region it has to help your
9:06 region do something like it's going to
9:08 be useful if people you know leverage
9:11 that research or something so that's how
9:13 that I think that's kind of like why I
9:16 got it but I believe strongly that most
9:18 of the reasons why I really got it was
9:20 not just around like the The Proposal
9:23 but also like obviously my supervisor
9:26 and the second thing is my all of the
9:28 works have already done way before
9:30 applying to it I had like a lot of
9:32 volunteering I have done a lot of
9:34 volunteering work I had like touched a
9:37 lot up and like all kinds of different
9:40 AI applied to different domains so I
9:43 think that's like one of the reasons why
9:44 I got it so what is it all about so
9:46 usually the in the fellow in the
9:48 fellowship you can think of it like a
9:50 scholarship because kind of like a
9:52 scholarship so they give you money right
9:55 so for example 100 um $ 100,000 sorry
10:00 $10,000 per year right so they actually
10:04 by the way the increased thatt now it's
10:06 12,000 but usually like 10,000 year for
10:09 three years but depending on the regions
10:10 for example Africa this is what we have
10:13 in I believe in the US they only give
10:15 them for one year because usually they
10:16 do have funding so what they give you on
10:19 top of the money they get also give you
10:21 a Google
10:22 mentor and it's up to you to leverage
10:24 this Mentor or not I usually I am a very
10:27 independent person
10:29 so I did like almost everything by
10:31 myself and like it's just sometimes I
10:33 like sometime you know when we had our
10:34 meetings I was like what do you think of
10:36 my proposal you know is it like relevant
10:39 or not and then he would like yeah it's
10:41 interesting you can go ahead with it
10:42 that's like practically much of our
10:45 meeting that's what I did in our
10:47 meetings well apart from that there is
10:50 like the PHD Fellowship Summit that
10:52 invite you to it's a virtual
10:55 Summit where obviously there are all of
10:57 the Google PhD fellows where gather
11:00 together and then googlers kind of like
11:02 talk about what they're doing in Google
11:04 in the research aspect obviously about
11:07 AI interesting and you mentioned that
11:11 one of the reasons you got this was the
11:14 CA and that it was helping the local
11:17 community yes but also not only that but
11:20 also because of all the previous work
11:24 you had done like all the volunteering
11:26 work that you applied AI to a lot of
11:29 things so maybe can you tell us more
11:31 about that like how exactly what kind of
11:33 voling work have you
11:37 done so my full Vol work was with amena
11:41 it was around the detection of
11:43 post-traumatic stress
11:45 disorder so um in in that project like
11:49 we kind of you know as always I'm not
11:51 sure if you know this but usually in AI
11:53 most of the time we have the problem of
11:55 data we have the problem of
11:57 computational resources so we didn't
11:59 have the data at the time we kind of
12:02 like had to get creative from from where
12:04 we got it from where we get it and then
12:06 we were like a bunch of AI Engineers
12:07 collaborating together to kind of like
12:10 help figure out if like from a certain
12:12 discussion if a person had PTSD or not
12:16 and we developed a chat board for that
12:19 and for example if someone we we
12:21 believed obviously I believe that that
12:23 person had a post-traumatic disorder we
12:26 suggested resources based on dsm5 and
12:30 caps these are like you know like
12:33 standard Psy psychiatric um kind of like
12:38 guidelines that we refer to so obviously
12:42 most of the time we always refer them to
12:44 the doctor because obviously with they I
12:45 can never trust it so this is like one
12:48 of the points and then apart from that
12:50 like from from then on I started like
12:52 volunteering with I'm Dana Moore so I
12:55 actually volunteered with their second
12:57 project about trash out which is like
13:01 around detecting if a certain trash is
13:04 recyclable or not using computer Visions
13:06 for example you kind of like have some
13:10 kind of trash and then you figure out if
13:12 it's recyclable or not and because
13:14 usually in the world every region has
13:17 its own regulations so on top of
13:19 figuring out if it was recyclable not we
13:21 had to figure out you know depend what
13:24 what type of actual trash it is
13:27 depending on the
13:30 and then that was like I believe my
13:32 second project with andena my third
13:35 project was with root punch Ai and it
13:38 was around you know around detecting our
13:43 curval so in in our spine we have curval
13:47 seven curval and we had to segment those
13:50 so what what they wanted us to do was to
13:53 segment this cicles so that they could
13:56 actually plot a certain function where
13:59 they like kind of like they try to know
14:03 if you know this movement that I'm doing
14:05 right now if it is normal if it is the
14:07 normal mov only right yes it's like they
14:11 were trying to figure out
14:13 if like for example when someone did a
14:16 surgery to replace one of these curval
14:19 was the movement still the same as it is
14:23 in normal settings right because like
14:26 what what happened was that when they
14:28 replace one of these
14:30 curval the kind of like the the meat
14:32 sticks to the to the new curval and it
14:36 the you know the neck doesn't move as
14:38 normally as it could so they wanted to
14:40 know you know like what was the
14:41 difference what was the factor that was
14:43 helping as do all of this movement you
14:46 know and kind of like figure out the
14:48 solution for that so that was like my
14:50 third project and then like all the
14:52 other project that came after that were
14:55 related like to my internship where I
14:57 started to do do uh it was an an online
15:00 internship this was my first online
15:01 internship
15:03 ever with stem away and actually like we
15:06 we had to kind of like um figure out
15:10 what type of topic a certain post can go
15:13 to so you know when you have a couple of
15:15 forums like for example stock overflow
15:17 Stock Exchange you have people
15:19 discussing a lot of topics and so for
15:21 example you might have someone say in a
15:23 certain discussion you might want like
15:25 to classify which topic this might be
15:27 for so for example if AI is it like
15:29 computer vision is it like using this
15:32 learning or something like that so that
15:33 was like what what the internship was
15:35 about then will you know started like
15:38 being a mentor from an intern from a
15:41 project lead to a mentor in in that sit
15:45 and then creating content for people to
15:48 learn
15:49 AI That's amazing like so many like
15:53 going back to this Oma the first project
15:56 was about detecting PTSD and implemented
15:59 the chatbot for that right cuz like I
16:01 imagine where can you even get the data
16:04 about that oh so we got it from someone
16:08 had a friend in the military and we we
16:11 they contact them it's in University in
16:13 the military they contacted them and
16:15 they said we could use that data at that
16:17 time I if I remember correctly IBM was
16:20 interested actually in develop in chat
16:23 PO for military people because like
16:26 mostly they are the ones who suffers
16:28 most from pts you know I mean they go
16:30 through traumatic events every almost
16:31 every day so they were interested in
16:33 developing a machine learning model and
16:35 that's why the data was available so we
16:37 can say we track Lu but like for example
16:40 for the trash out what we did was that
16:42 we already we we already have some data
16:46 but obviously if you're doing
16:48 segmentation you need more data than
16:51 than than for example just a couple of
16:53 like 100 is not enough right so what we
16:56 did was that we LED op open images
16:59 there's like a huge Google open source
17:02 open images what we did was we had to
17:05 pick trash from
17:06 that and we pick a trash from Google
17:09 Images so we kind of like had to get
17:11 creative around how to collect data and
17:14 this is like what happens in every
17:15 volunteering challenge I have vent and
17:18 normally like this happens with people
17:20 who you know like even businesses that
17:22 could can't afford to buy data or you
17:24 know like kind of get their own data
17:26 from somewhere so they kind of like you
17:28 have to get creative around where you
17:30 can find that data and in research it
17:33 happens a
17:34 lot especially if you don't have
17:37 funding it's hard to find
17:40 data how did you actually come across
17:43 this project from am like how do you
17:46 find this PTSD project the first one
17:48 that's a good question so from my
17:50 LinkedIn so one of the things I you know
17:53 when I was back in I remember it was my
17:56 first year the one where I discovered
17:58 you know I was interested in AI the
18:00 whole time I was complaining about
18:02 opportunities so when when I got into um
18:05 AI I was really and I I I knew I needed
18:08 to get a PhD or a master right so I can
18:12 further my studies and develop the
18:14 skills because what we had in Morocco
18:16 was still kind of like we didn't have
18:18 experts we had only a few people who
18:20 actually knew about Ai and mastered it
18:24 so I needed to get more expertise and I
18:26 wanted to go abroad and one of the
18:28 things I was like always complain about
18:30 why do we not have opportunities you
18:32 know to further to further our uh you
18:35 know studies and get funding and you
18:36 know scholarships and all of that so
18:39 what I developed I I kind of like
18:41 developed the reflex of searching for
18:43 opportunities so right now it's like I
18:45 have a I use my Facebook Twitter and
18:48 Linkedin just for just for opportunities
18:51 hunting so whenever I see someone
18:53 posting something interesting that's why
18:55 actually I I send a lot of LinkedIn
18:57 requests so so I have people from all
18:59 over the world with different you know
19:02 with different um opportunities that
19:05 they post from time to time and so I
19:07 make it like you can think of it like a
19:10 task or a habit now I scroll every day
19:12 through all of my LinkedIn feed or
19:14 Facebook feed for an opportunity
19:16 although now I kind of like know where
19:18 the Treasure Trove is thanks to the
19:21 mailing listed so it's easier to get
19:24 opportunities but before that's how I
19:26 actually got across the LinkedIn by
19:28 actually like the onena thing by R rud
19:32 BB his name is a bit difficult to
19:34 pronounce he is the founder of Hena and
19:37 he was posting about his their I believe
19:40 it was their second challenge where they
19:42 were actually detecting
19:45 rooftops and that's how I learned abouta
19:48 and he was like yeah sure it will be
19:49 interesting you know to use my skills
19:51 and help in that way and that's how I
19:54 came across
19:55 PTSD challenge Okay so soal social media
19:59 right so you follow relevant people
20:02 interesting people yes and then they
20:07 post relevant stuff and then you follow
20:10 on that like you connect with them you
20:13 ask hey I want to take part right yeah
20:17 that's cool but can't like sometimes for
20:21 me like when I open LinkedIn it can be a
20:24 bit overwhelming overwheling yeah it is
20:28 that's why you kind of like need to be
20:32 very specific around who you
20:35 follow and you need to be
20:37 mindful yes and you need to be mindful
20:40 around how much time you're spending so
20:43 for example for me actually like to be
20:45 honest I developed the bad habit of
20:49 scrolling you know not just scrolling
20:51 like for example sometimes I'm just like
20:53 holding my phone and it's a f it's a
20:56 phone like I'm I'm like always doing
20:57 like this this you know ex SC right one
21:00 time I was reading a book it was around
21:02 Lan startup and I was in a train and I
21:06 wanted to move to the next page so
21:07 instead of moving you know turning the
21:13 next didn't work right so yeah that's
21:17 you know it's a bad habit so right now
21:18 what I'm doing is that I cut off all
21:21 social media from my phone but I check
21:24 them out on my laptop usually my laptop
21:26 is only for work so if I do it I like I
21:30 do it only like for five minutes to 10
21:31 minutes and then go out to do my
21:35 work and I guess if you like this post
21:38 that are about relevant opportunities
21:40 then LinkedIn next time you open it will
21:43 surface suggestions recommendations yes
21:46 sure yeah and by the way Facebook is a
21:49 great place to find opportunities as
21:51 well but please don't follow irrelevant
21:54 people and kind of like think that you
21:56 will get anything
21:58 interesting kind of like try to see
22:01 where for example it's about like
22:03 specifically main main you know the
22:05 topic you're interested so for example
22:07 for me I'm interested in computer vision
22:10 for example let's say healthcare for
22:12 example for now I will join only
22:15 Facebook groups that talk about that
22:17 specifically and I will make sure that
22:19 it's not a Facebook group that is you
22:21 know full of irant
22:23 posted Yeah because sometimes it's about
22:25 a topic but it has nothing to do with
22:27 what they are posting about I noticed
22:30 that what Twitter recently started doing
22:32 is uh in addition to people who I follow
22:35 they also started mixing in popular
22:37 content yeah which is like puppy videos
22:41 or I know
22:43 movie like things from movies or quotes
22:46 or like whatever and ads lots of ads and
22:50 ads yeah
22:51 so but you know I mean everyone is
22:54 trying to kind of like rip some money
22:56 off people so that's why I guess they're
23:00 being like that yeah I mean ads I
23:02 understand ads like and ads sometimes
23:04 they're relevant right so like if the
23:06 algorithm is good then they show elevant
23:09 ads okay I don't mind that but like py
23:11 videos it's like they just want to to to
23:14 get me to stay on the platform and then
23:16 like who doesn't like puppies right
23:20 yeah but like just just you know just be
23:24 careful how much time you spend in there
23:26 but Twitter is a great place if you're
23:28 researcher because like most researchers
23:30 hung there that's their fabulite place
23:32 at least it used to be well I remember
23:36 Jan leun once wrote that I'm living
23:39 Twitter I'll never come back yes yes it
23:42 was the masteron era yeah but he is
23:45 still there
23:48 right okay uh so this is how you found
23:51 this opportunities through social
23:54 media and so you found amena then you
23:57 took another you took part in another
24:01 challenge with am and then there was
24:03 this fruit Pine Chi right which is a
24:06 similar platform right or what is that
24:08 yes yes it's just that like the setting
24:10 is a little bit different so for example
24:13 Oma like G like gathers all of us
24:16 together AI engineers and leaves and
24:19 kind of like we do have meetings but
24:21 like leaves the freedom for us to work
24:24 on what we want or what is relevant to
24:27 you know what we want achieve but like
24:29 for example for fruit punch AI it's more
24:31 structured like for example they have
24:33 team for every test they are the ones
24:36 like describing the tasks very
24:38 specifically and then like assign if you
24:41 you know if you want to join a specific
24:43 task but it's already a task there like
24:46 you don't have to come up with the task
24:49 yourself but then it's actually like
24:52 they just give you a general problem yes
24:55 and then it's up to you how exactly
24:57 approach
24:59 Tas while in front punch it's more
25:04 structured like you would have at works
25:06 like somebody could be like a sort of
25:08 air quotes product manager or somebody
25:11 like business person right who
25:14 translates the requirements to like
25:17 translates the this they are the one who
25:19 does that yeah they they are the one who
25:21 do that so they are the ones who
25:23 translate the
25:25 requirements uh sorry the definition
25:28 like the the problem into actual tasks
25:31 specific tasks for amena they do like
25:34 you know tell you here's a problem here
25:36 are parts of the problem that we want to
25:38 solve here are our objectives but who is
25:41 going to do what like what is the
25:44 specific task and everything like that
25:46 it's up to the AI Engineers that we
25:48 figure it out but then I think it's
25:50 because of the public so for fruit punch
25:52 AI they really Target people who are
25:53 still beginners but like fora they tar
25:57 people are already advanced like you at
26:00 least have to have you know have done at
26:02 least two to three projects in AI to be
26:05 able to kind of like you know be able to
26:08 really navigate the the the challenge
26:12 because it's really hard when you have a
26:13 lot of experts around and you're like
26:16 intimidated to do anything if you're if
26:18 you're not familiar with the vibe does
26:21 it mean that if I'm a beginner I cannot
26:23 take part in am challenges you can
26:26 that's the thing you can won't block you
26:29 but it's just that it's going to be very
26:31 overwhelming but people usually are very
26:33 nice so if you if you're not shy and if
26:35 you ask for help everyone will most than
26:38 surely help like people are really nice
26:40 like everyone is willing to help and
26:41 ready to
26:43 help okay let's say I want to join
26:46 challenge a similar Challenge from abana
26:48 from fruit Point ji from something else
26:52 from some
26:53 other companies join
26:56 us you who the AI Wonder Girls okay tell
27:01 us more about that so we're a group of
27:03 ladies interested in AI like from
27:06 different walks of life there are people
27:07 who are tech there are people who are
27:09 business related and we like get
27:11 together like we find a challenge that's
27:13 interesting for us hackaton competition
27:15 you name it we get together and then
27:17 work on and then work on
27:19 it that's
27:22 it no that's not it like fcy more like
27:26 what are you working on right now
27:28 yeah so prev well right now I'm not sure
27:30 if any of us like because we have budges
27:32 it's like it's like the name is the same
27:36 but like we have different teams like
27:38 any team can you know can like you
27:40 gather like five at least ladies
27:43 together or Tre and then like we Sho
27:45 something interesting so there are
27:47 people are interested in healthcare me
27:50 so like most of them there's something
27:52 related to healthcare I'm like you know
27:54 I shareed the link in our WhatsApp group
27:57 and I'm like ladies are you in who's in
27:59 and then we get together you know we
28:01 pump up our first meeting figure out
28:03 what they want from us from a challenge
28:05 or the hackaton and obviously like one
28:08 of the things we really care about is
28:10 judging criteria so we figured that out
28:13 first then we figure out what they are
28:15 interested in as helping solve and then
28:18 like we brainstorm together we come up
28:21 with a you know we come up with a couple
28:23 of ideas to to explore we gather data
28:26 around it Is it feasible if it's
28:28 feasible we move on and then we start
28:31 coding right if it's not then obviously
28:33 we move on to the next idea until we
28:35 find what we're looking for but usually
28:38 like most of the because like we have
28:40 won a couple of challenges actually from
28:42 the day we started we kept winning until
28:45 like now sometimes we don't
28:48 win yeah I I have so many questions
28:51 about like winning and challenges but
28:53 like I want to take a step back go ahead
28:55 go ahead yeah so
28:59 the way it works as I understood so
29:01 there's already a community this
29:03 WhatsApp of ladies who are interested in
29:06 Ai and doing something with this and
29:09 then like there's already community
29:13 and there is not necessarily there is
29:15 not necessarily a problem that you want
29:17 to solve yet right and then somebody
29:20 could be you could be somebody else says
29:22 like let's work on this problem right
29:26 and then yeah yeah let's work work and
29:27 then you start analyzing this problem
29:30 start checking if it's even possible if
29:33 it's feasible to solve it is there data
29:35 right and then you go through this
29:37 process and then you understand okay
29:39 this is feasible this is possible this
29:41 data is there let's work on that and
29:43 then you spend a bit of time I don't
29:46 know a few weeks working on that so
29:49 there's also an objective I guess so
29:50 once you understand okay we reached the
29:53 objective or maybe we did not reach the
29:55 objective because of reasons right and
29:58 then you finish the project and then the
30:00 process you submit and then it goes up
30:03 once again submit
30:06 where Al so for example if it's a
30:08 hackaton usually you'll be submitting
30:10 your solution to the hackaton so if you
30:12 check out the post they have a couple of
30:14 hackaton so we choose one so one of the
30:16 things that we're very specific about is
30:19 that that chall has to at least touch
30:22 one sdg
30:25 goal so you know it has to have an
30:28 impact that's why we are all there we're
30:30 interested in Impact in using like our
30:33 AI skills for
30:35 impact so like cre yeah so the the way I
30:39 understood and it's problem saying is
30:42 like you always come up with problems
30:43 yourself but you also mentioned hackaton
30:46 so I guess the same Community the same
30:47 WhatsApp groups the same WhatsApp group
30:50 somebody could be you say okay I come
30:52 across this hakon let's take part right
30:55 yeah this hakon is uh it has a good cost
31:00 it's like for social good right so then
31:03 let's take part yeah that's it so can
31:08 you tell us about one of the
31:10 hackaton yeah so for example our first
31:12 haakon was around Medical Imaging it was
31:16 from Microsoft and straa so I actually
31:20 like that was the first one that started
31:22 everything so um previously I I really
31:25 wanted to be part of hackathons I was
31:27 amazed by people who got together and
31:30 you know come up with a solution and
31:32 then won something by the end of it and
31:35 I really wanted to do it I tried it
31:38 before it didn't work but then this time
31:40 I was like this is really a cool
31:42 hackaton and we have a bunch of ladies
31:44 gathered together interested in Ai and
31:46 said let's try my chance so I copy
31:49 pasted the link into the group and I
31:52 was like uh ladies there's really super
31:55 cool hackaton would you be interested by
31:57 the way to you know take part of it
32:00 that's how eight ladies got interested
32:02 you know reached out let's do this we
32:04 created our own Discord created our own
32:07 channel and started exchanging our ideas
32:10 around how we could you know how we
32:13 could participate and what we could
32:14 offer based obviously on the description
32:17 and then the judging criteria usually in
32:20 these hackaton especially you know if
32:22 it's from a reputable Source usually
32:25 they have mentors they always provide
32:27 mentors because this was around medical
32:31 communication they do provide doctors so
32:34 we had a meeting with a doctor we
32:36 understood their needs like he told us
32:39 they already had AI tools but like they
32:43 they they would like it if like the AI
32:45 like if they were not notified when the
32:48 AI like you know finished its test for
32:50 example going over a radio a radio you
32:54 know like C for example just x-ray going
32:56 over a radio um modality for example and
33:01 be notified about it and obviously like
33:03 help them actually write the report
33:06 because like one of the one of the
33:07 issues that usually it's not the issues
33:10 one of the things that makes it so
33:13 so I think like difficult to do their
33:17 job it's that you know if you remember
33:19 like in the time of covid they had a lot
33:22 of people coming in right because like
33:24 almost everyone was touched right so
33:27 were overwhelmed in their in in in their
33:29 rology in their rology section A
33:33 radiologue normally has only eight
33:35 minutes to read to read the the the the
33:39 scan and then do the report so what they
33:42 wanted us to do was to expedite this
33:45 this part to actually have the AI come
33:47 up with the report and then the rad you
33:50 know the radul can actually go over the
33:53 the report and you know like fix it if
33:55 possible so that's kind of like the
33:57 the final solution one was about that's
34:00 it like we figure out what they want
34:02 from us what they want what the mentors
34:04 wants from us we review our idea with
34:06 them and then keep refining it well you
34:09 know obviously when you have a couple of
34:12 Engineers put together you know most of
34:15 the time the solution only come UPS near
34:17 the end of the hackaton you know how we
34:21 love to work only last minute so that's
34:23 kind of like how we usually do it so
34:26 it's like the all month where sometimes
34:28 meeting sometimes talking about the
34:30 solution and then like the last week
34:33 we're all rushing you know put in it
34:35 full front to be able to deliver the
34:37 solution we kind of agreed on and
34:40 usually like most of the time we kind of
34:43 try to deliver as much as we can that
34:45 means for example for the medical imas
34:47 we did not only you know we did not only
34:50 for example take the Radiology detected
34:53 for it was about hand fracture does the
34:56 patient have hand fracture or not
34:59 delivered the report we also provided a
35:01 dashboard so they can see all the cases
35:04 that were coming in you know and all the
35:07 details that you can find in a dcon file
35:09 that is like Jer demographics anything
35:12 you can think of it and then we provided
35:14 what we call future work that is like
35:16 improving the platform you know the UI
35:19 of the platform the visuals and then you
35:22 know like the delivery and then like
35:23 sending the message over to their phones
35:27 tablets whatever they have hands on so
35:30 we don't usually so in almost all of our
35:32 hackaton or challenges we work on we
35:35 never provide one solution that's
35:38 actually the power of number because
35:39 like most of the time we're five to
35:41 eight people so we have the luxury of
35:44 having everyone focus on an aspect that
35:47 could be added so we don't work on one
35:49 solution we work several Solutions in
35:50 one package that's the reason why we win
35:54 obviously we respect the judging
35:56 criteria and a lot of other stuff okay
35:59 so do I understand correctly that
36:02 there's actually like a question how to
36:05 Wi what's the key to winning hackaton so
36:08 let me try to summarize what you said
36:09 and then maybe we'll add more so first
36:12 of all you have a mentor and you need to
36:15 get most from this mentor to really
36:17 understand what they want from you so
36:20 these people will tell you how to
36:22 actually what kind of things you need to
36:24 do right so they will help you
36:26 understand the they will help you to
36:28 understand what exactly you need to to
36:31 give at the end to show wait by the way
36:34 they won't tell you you need to get it
36:36 out from the yeah yeah yeah of
36:39 course yeah so it's not like they just
36:42 oh here by the way this is how you do
36:45 this right so you ask right okay you
36:48 will tell us how to do this but let me
36:51 finish the summary then the second thing
36:54 is you don't focus on one single thing
36:58 right so once you figure out okay this
37:00 is the problem this is the
37:02 solution you explore other Solutions
37:05 right and then you think okay like there
37:07 are two three potential things we can do
37:10 how can we put them in kind of in one
37:12 package to form one solution from them
37:15 and then you split into subgroups and
37:17 work on this sub Solutions and then you
37:21 present it as a whole thing and that's
37:23 why you win so that's the key to winning
37:25 understanding
37:27 talking to your
37:28 mentors and presenting multiple
37:33 Solutions okay is there anything else
37:36 like what else you would add yeah so you
37:41 can think of it this like a business so
37:44 in business usually you have obviously
37:46 clients and you have an offer right so
37:50 one of the key criterias in business is
37:52 to understand your clients to be able to
37:54 provide them with the offer that is
37:55 going to suit them right this is very
37:57 similar in hackaton or challenges or
37:59 anything you're doing right so you need
38:02 to understand the judges so what do the
38:06 judges care about you first need to know
38:08 who they are if it's possible otherwise
38:11 you need to read through the lines like
38:13 what is what is what does what matters
38:16 to these people what is it that they
38:18 stressed about that you really want to
38:20 get so this is like the most crucial
38:23 part and you need to be very careful of
38:25 the judging CR
38:27 so what do they want what are they going
38:28 to be you know you know like giving
38:31 notes on so for example if they care
38:32 about inclusion nice in your
38:35 presentation make sure you leverage the
38:37 fact that you're an amazing eight ladies
38:40 from all over parts of the
38:42 world right and working on AI so this is
38:46 a winning like this is a winning point
38:48 in in one of the judging criteria for
38:50 example so if they care about I don't
38:52 know some kind of like let's say they
38:55 care about the environment figure out a
38:57 way to add environment in your in your
38:59 solution right so figure out how to
39:02 Leverage What They what they're looking
39:04 for what they care about as judges as
39:07 people as a person and then as
39:11 organizers of the hackaton and if you
39:13 kind of kind of try to figure out what
39:16 they want out of the hackaton that will
39:18 be a plus that's like the best way to
39:20 win is to understand what they want and
39:23 kind of like deliver on it to the best
39:25 you can
39:27 MH that's the winning
39:29 criteria that's smart and is there
39:32 something that most people Miss like I
39:34 guess if there is criteria if there's a
39:37 list of criteria then most people try to
39:40 okay they care about environment so
39:42 let's said something is there something
39:44 that most people Miss yes you don't no
39:48 there is um there is there is there's
39:50 one thing actually that we all miss
39:54 on it's the fact that we say I can't do
39:59 this right so what I invite you to do is
40:02 not to think about the fact that you
40:04 can't do this it's to think about what
40:07 you can do with what you
40:09 have right so for example let's say I
40:12 don't know let's say for example I want
40:14 to build um a model that detects if
40:18 someone has I don't know hair loss or
40:22 not through for example some kind of
40:24 data from bio not for examp example from
40:27 images right it's difficult if you don't
40:29 have the data right but what if you got
40:33 creative around it do you really have to
40:36 have that data isn't there some kind of
40:38 other place where you can find similar
40:40 data or you can you know kind I heck
40:43 right now with llms you can create your
40:45 own data and you know because because
40:48 when what you're look what they're
40:49 looking for is for you to show them that
40:53 it's possible to be done in hackaton
40:55 they're not looking for for the Final
40:56 Solution that's not possible like when
40:58 you have eight one one like one month to
41:01 two monthes you can only come up with
41:03 the MVP right so this that's what you
41:06 want to do focus on how you can build
41:08 the MVP and don't think about I don't
41:11 have the means so for example if you
41:12 lack computational power there's goggle
41:15 there's collab you know leverage the
41:18 resources you have get creative around
41:20 which you can build this this is like
41:22 one of the one of the reasons why we
41:24 usually fail in hack sound people give
41:27 up too early because when they get into
41:29 the solution they're like oh my God what
41:31 did I get into this is not possible to
41:33 be done but that's not how you should
41:36 like approach it so the state the
41:40 mindset mindset should be like it's not
41:44 like it's not possible but how can I do
41:48 something that brings me closer right
41:51 and then it could be just thinking maybe
41:53 taking a step back and then exploring
41:55 other ways to to do this like instead of
41:58 getting data you generate the data or
42:02 like as you said from social media
42:04 research
42:06 papers so what if I'm the least creative
42:08 person on
42:09 Earth how do I go about being creative
42:13 when it comes to getting that's a cool
42:15 question well thanks to generative AI
42:17 you have sh GPT you have gini you have
42:20 all kinds of AIS to help you get
42:22 creative so you can just go around and
42:25 delete I want to you know I want to
42:27 build this solution just tell it
42:29 everything you you have as a problem
42:31 there is no
42:32 data I have never worked on this
42:36 before I have only experienced in I
42:38 don't know like try basic machine
42:41 learning models how can I you know win
42:44 this hackaton with the following judging
42:46 criteria with you know all give it all
42:48 the descriptions and then let it run
42:50 wild and the only thing you have to do
42:52 pick the solution that you feel most
42:55 comfortable
42:57 Yeah so basically just
43:00 um
43:01 tell
43:03 the childboard all you know about the
43:06 problem yes share and what you want from
43:09 it yeah
43:10 yeah so this is like one way if we
43:13 didn't have ai how can you do that so
43:18 one of the best ways is oh one of the
43:21 things I forgot to talk about is your
43:25 team so you need to pick the right
43:28 people in your team in your team there
43:30 is a need for someone to be
43:32 creative there is a need for someone to
43:35 love doing things that is someone is
43:37 going to build the actual solution
43:39 there's a need for someone who is a
43:41 little bit technical they don't have to
43:42 be 1,00% know how to do it but they at
43:45 least have to know how to do
43:46 something so your team is one of your
43:49 assets if you can't and if you're not a
43:52 creative but you want you know get ideas
43:55 simple there are a couple of ways you
43:57 can do it first things first you can go
43:59 to redit figure out what people complain
44:02 about in that subject area the main here
44:05 you go here's your idea there there's a
44:07 lot of complaints just pick the one you
44:09 you you find the most you know relatable
44:12 to the hackaton or challenge or research
44:15 if you're doing research by the way this
44:16 is like it's the same thing whatever you
44:19 want project you want to start even a
44:20 startup go do some market research like
44:23 try to understand what people are
44:24 complaining about
44:26 and leverage that to come up with a
44:28 solution so this is like one of them and
44:32 usually if you're in this field related
44:34 to it you might want to start reading
44:36 research papers on a weekly basis or at
44:40 least follow people who do so for
44:42 example I'm not really a huge fan of
44:44 reading typical research papers I only
44:47 love reviews Tor reviews so I don't
44:50 usually read much of the normal papers
44:52 but I do follow a lot of people who read
44:54 papers practically all researchers I'm
44:57 interested in I follow them and then
45:00 there are like the Enthusiast people who
45:01 are interested in like in a certain
45:03 specific topic and they share about it
45:05 so the only thing I have to do is scroll
45:07 through my feed and here I am I know
45:10 like practically everything that there
45:12 is to know about the latest stuff
45:13 happening how do you find them on
45:16 Twitter oh simple it just follow one
45:19 person and then there's a suggestion to
45:21 follow a couple of others on Twitter
45:23 right on Twitter because there is a
45:26 question from Omar what's the best way
45:28 to Foster your Twitter oh cool so here
45:32 is here it is the easiest
45:35 way do let's say for example let's pick
45:37 you you for example what is your
45:39 favorite subject in machine learning or
45:41 deep learning
45:45 General
45:47 okay let's say NLP all right cool NLP
45:51 what do you like in NLP there are so
45:52 many stuffs about it hey you're putting
45:55 me on
45:56 one let quick one let's say Transformers
46:00 Transformers so I was going to say fake
46:02 news but like let's say that's good
46:03 let's say fake news so the only thing
46:05 I'm going to do is like I'm going to go
46:07 to Goog Google like the Google Scholar
46:10 then type NLP fake news right and then I
46:14 will get a couple of paper suggestions
46:17 and based on your preferences I usually
46:20 like you can Rank by by date and then
46:22 you can check out their papers someone
46:25 you like their papers you like try to
46:27 figure out if they are on Twitter
46:29 they're not on Twitter try to figure out
46:31 if they are on LinkedIn right so kind of
46:33 like try to figure out the people that
46:36 you like the stuffs from follow them
46:39 just follow them or you can just use
46:42 hashtags use hash NLP hash fake news in
46:46 research bar of Twitter and you have a
46:49 couple of people that you can check out
46:51 from and obviously like before you click
46:53 on follow please make sure that you
46:55 check out all of their Feats to be to be
46:57 sure that it aligns with your values
47:00 otherwise you might get some very bad
47:03 unexpected even though they are
47:06 researchers they are also people and
47:08 they might share
47:11 yeah the travel plans right but yes just
47:15 make sure that it it aligns with your
47:18 values okay
47:20 so find things on Google Scholar and
47:23 then find the people on Twitter
47:26 or attend conferences if you're not a
47:28 research person attend an event and then
47:32 get to know people see if they have
47:33 their Twitter if you like someone ask
47:35 for their
47:36 Twitter or obviously their social
47:40 media okay and then if you like yeah if
47:43 you don't have the budget for example to
47:45 attend a conference because sometimes
47:47 it's expensive what you can do is go to
47:50 the conference you like and then see the
47:53 the list speakers list usually they
47:55 provide the program for free like you
47:57 can just check it out and see like the
47:59 talks that you like by the way try your
48:03 chance copy past that title and their
48:05 name and see if the if the if the if the
48:09 talk has been record if it's on YouTube
48:11 or if it's even shared on social media
48:14 right oh or just Google it and see if
48:16 it's shared well obviously watch it see
48:19 if you like it if you like it then
48:20 follow that person otherwise move on
48:23 yeah I mean just research just use your
48:25 your
48:27 creativity and then as you said once you
48:30 follow one person then Twitter suggest
48:32 can follow the others yes like like that
48:36 person okay that's smart thank
48:40 you so another question have you share
48:45 tips on how to apply for this
48:48 volunteering
48:49 projects
48:50 um um like what oh yeah that's true
48:54 let's say for example
48:56 I there's umena challenge they have a
48:59 lot of challenges by the way you can
49:01 check them out and in different areas
49:03 they touch different sdg goals so let's
49:07 say you like the challenge one of the
49:09 first things we do is read about the
49:11 challenge okay just know what it is what
49:14 you're going to do and how comfortable
49:16 you're going to be with it you can think
49:17 of it like applying to a job so usually
49:20 when you're applying to a job you need
49:21 to figure out what they want from you
49:24 and you need to adapt your CV to that so
49:27 I'm not I don't think they ask for CV
49:30 but they will be doing an interview so
49:32 when they're doing an interview think of
49:34 it like you don't need to think of it
49:36 like a job interview so be very relaxed
49:39 I mean it's just volunteering they're
49:41 not going to pay you it it helps usually
49:44 like calm the nerves when you know
49:45 they're not paying
49:47 you so just pit yourself you know just
49:50 tell them let's say for example it was
49:53 around PTSD you know like postraumatic
49:55 stress disorder I never I was never a
49:58 psychologist or anything like that but
50:00 I'm a huge fan of medical field and I'm
50:02 a huge fan of humans behavior in general
50:05 so I was like when he when they asked me
50:07 why they wanted to to you know to join I
50:10 just like talked about my passion they
50:12 just kept mumbling here is why you know
50:15 to just be direct and try to when you're
50:17 talking try to Showcase like how
50:20 relevant your skills are to what you're
50:23 applying for right so for example if you
50:25 have done NLP before even though it's
50:27 not in healthcare you can mention that
50:29 so what way what they want to see is
50:31 just the fact that you have already done
50:32 this so that they they don't want you to
50:35 get into the challenge and then stay
50:37 stuck because you will see a lot of
50:39 people like rocking it do you know going
50:42 hard on the task and then coming up with
50:44 solution you're they like stuck and then
50:46 looking at them not doing anything right
50:49 so they want to make sure that you at
50:51 least have the basics to be able to
50:53 navigate around the
50:59 so and uh like I'm wondering MH what do
51:03 you actually get from participating in
51:06 these projects like it's not paid so
51:09 you're getting some experience I assume
51:12 what is it in there for you like why do
51:16 you take part or why should I why would
51:18 I want to take part what do you think
51:21 okay
51:23 so I will be talking about impact and
51:26 then practical let's start with
51:28 practical so when you're trying to
51:30 search for an internship most of right
51:32 and they tell you they are you know like
51:34 doing X or Y like they will be given you
51:39 to do specific tasks right when you get
51:42 in they don't give you that they give
51:44 you something completely unrelated most
51:46 of the time or at least they will give
51:48 you something that is similar but it's
51:51 not really what you signed up for with
51:54 volunteering you get get to choose what
51:56 you want to apply to and actually what
52:00 they tell you is going to be done is
52:02 100% what is going to be done and a
52:05 little bit more so you're going like to
52:08 to do that touch that and then touch a
52:10 couple of more other things that you
52:12 might be excited about for growth so
52:15 this is one um in internships I'm not
52:18 sure if it's this case everywhere around
52:20 the world but some of them are paid most
52:24 of them aren't not so you don't get paid
52:28 either way now for for internship with a
52:31 with an organization usually what they
52:33 end up giving you is like um statement
52:35 that you did in do internship with them
52:38 that is also this the case with onena or
52:41 food P or any kind of other volunteering
52:43 platform they will give you a
52:46 certificate saying that you actually did
52:49 you know participate in in in in the
52:51 challenge of volunteer
52:53 whatever let's talk about now employment
52:56 so usually in employment what one of the
52:59 things that they required from you apart
53:01 from the certificate for example they
53:03 will require people they can talk to
53:06 right people from the volunteering side
53:09 will be super happy to actually help you
53:13 get a referral like refer you to jobs or
53:16 even actually like you know vouch about
53:19 your skills especially if you did well
53:21 you know if you contributed and you were
53:24 active they will be super happy to
53:26 recommend you and even actually help you
53:28 find
53:30 jobs in the corporate world and to get
53:34 them to do your referral is just like
53:36 just like trying to push them to wet
53:39 someone it's really
53:43 difficult in volunteering you meet
53:46 people from all over the world you meet
53:50 you you don't just meet like people who
53:52 have worked on like one issue or like
53:55 very specific issues they have worked on
53:58 different things and they have a
53:59 different Broad View right different
54:01 mindset different cultures and so you
54:04 get to actually play the role you want
54:06 like for example you might be the team
54:08 lead or you might be like the project
54:10 manager you might be something that you
54:12 want to but in an organization they
54:14 can't give you that position because
54:16 code code you don't have to experience
54:18 you don't have what it takes to do that
54:20 job so here in inv volun you have
54:24 flexibility in a typical job setting you
54:28 don't that's actually like one of the
54:30 main advantages in in an in a work
54:33 setting impact is not what is most of
54:37 the time important it's actually profit
54:39 or the task is you know required by the
54:43 employer in volunteering the most
54:46 important thing is
54:48 actually
54:51 impact so if something doesn't have
54:53 impact well most likely we will scratch
54:56 it from our
54:58 list these are all the
55:01 benefits so experience connections and
55:04 then impact and then I guess you also
55:06 feel good because you helped some social
55:08 cuse right yeah and soft skills s skill
55:12 which are actually like highly valuable
55:14 but we don't usually care much if you're
55:17 in organization they might not give you
55:19 the chance to present a project talk
55:21 about it and then you know like debate
55:23 it with other but in you know in commun
55:27 you know when you're doing it
55:28 volunteering you have a bunch of people
55:30 you know you can talk to and then
55:33 obviously like you get to practice your
55:35 communication you get to practice
55:37 presentation if you want to you know to
55:39 do that and then obviously you also get
55:42 to if you're you know if you're not if
55:44 you're non English speaking or non
55:47 language speaking something and you want
55:49 to practice it you get to the chance to
55:52 practice your English with actually
55:54 that's one of the reasons why so many
55:56 people think my English is good it's
55:58 because I have been collaborating with a
55:59 lot of people and talking in
56:04 English and right now in data do club we
56:09 have a course about data engineering and
56:12 there is a a question do you know any
56:15 opportunities for data Engineers so like
56:18 if I if I want to if I'm a data engineer
56:21 or if I'm studying to become a data
56:23 engineer can I also apply for these um
56:26 data projects or it's more like for data
56:28 scientist AI people yeah I mean when
56:31 you're when you're doing when you're
56:33 doing this volunteering work remember
56:35 that a task is Broad what you want to do
56:39 will relate to how you want to do it
56:41 right so they're not going to force you
56:43 to do something so this is one of the
56:45 perks about so if you're interested in
56:46 data engineering uh let's say in data
56:49 engineering one of the most important
56:50 things is actually like picking the
56:52 right data and preparing right you could
56:54 go ahead and say I will start a task
56:57 around data engineering you know like
56:59 preparing the data for the data
57:01 scientists or AI or ml people to
57:04 actually you know fully like um leverage
57:08 it so you can do that so the only
57:11 thing knowledge yeah oh oh they will be
57:14 over the moon yeah yeah just like a and
57:16 by the way like in mostly in this
57:18 volunteering work most of the time the
57:21 data is a huge mess so it's a great you
57:24 know it's a great experience for you to
57:26 learn the real mess of of data and to
57:29 deal with it and then you mentioned that
57:31 in one of the hackaton you also build
57:34 dashboard not only like a model but also
57:36 a dashboard and in order to build the
57:38 dashboard you need to have the
57:39 foundation you have to you have to have
57:41 the data in the right form such that you
57:43 can present it and then this is
57:45 something that data Engineers usually do
57:47 yeah but like usually for example you
57:50 know when you're doing this with a with
57:51 with a with a with all everyone an AI
57:55 engineer you kind of like learn a couple
57:57 of skills that have nothing to do with
57:59 your with your title and that's actually
58:01 one of the things that are really cool
58:03 is that you get to touch up all the
58:05 parts that you might be that you might
58:08 want to explore but normally in an
58:10 organization they won't give you the
58:12 chance to touch it because you don't
58:14 have the
58:16 skills we don't have a lot of time so
58:18 there's one last question and you
58:22 mentioned when you were looking for
58:23 opportunities and and you still look for
58:26 I think yeah so I asked you how do you
58:28 usually find this opportunities and you
58:30 said social media but right now I'm
58:32 cutting down on that uh I'm only doing
58:35 it from desktop but you also mentioned
58:37 that you're subscribed to newsletter yes
58:40 where you get this opportunities from so
58:43 can you mention which newsletters are
58:46 this yeah so for example women women in
58:50 machine
58:51 learning they have like they keep every
58:55 they keep posting every day about
58:57 opportunities PhD opportun PhD students
59:00 opportunities uh job opportunities for
59:03 all for all um expertise levels so

59:23 might request you to send in your CV so
59:25 they can send you these specific
59:27 opportunities apart from that there is
59:29 like a couple of great newsletters but
59:32 it's for French people for people who
59:34 are in in France or knows how to speak

59:39 uh research newsletters there are a lot
59:42 of them so yeah just Google them and
59:45 then you will find them all over they
59:47 have great opportunities as well but
59:49 there are like couple of other
59:50 newsletters like for example your new

1:00:00 are AI specific and especially for for
1:00:03 communities like usually as communities
1:00:06 that share these kind of of relevant job
1:00:08 offers opportunities but if it's one
1:00:11 person newsletter or something you know
1:00:13 specific they might not share about them
