2:02 when she was working at um VMware right
2:05 it was V VMware yeah yeah and then we
2:08 connected a while back and then I was in
2:10 PTO visiting an Wasing conference data

2:16 Club um event there data dinner and I
2:20 get I was there and we had a chat and it

2:50 long career choices transitions
2:52 promotions in and out of tech so before
2:55 we start with the main topic let's start
2:58 with your background can you tell us
2:59 about your your career career Journey so
3:01 far MH yeah so in order to kind of
3:05 understand myself I made a little
3:07 chronological uh list for myself so yeah
3:11 after school like after nth grade I went
3:13 to trade school to actually study art I
3:16 went into web design and then I learned
3:18 that I'm not so good at Art I am uh yeah
3:22 there I had my first experience in
3:23 programming and uh this on the other
3:26 hand I discovered that I'm really good
3:28 at and uh I managed to get uh some
3:31 things done that were like um kind of
3:33 really challenging and um I also enjoyed
3:37 programming so after my web design
3:41 education obviously I couldn't find a
3:43 job like it's not very easy to to become
3:45 designer especially if you're not very
3:46 good at
3:47 it so I worked as a waitress for a
3:50 couple of years in um yeah in the in the
3:53 in the center I come from Ria from lvia
3:55 so yeah worked as a waitress and uh
3:58 there at some point Point came to my
4:00 mind that maybe I should pursue um
4:04 bachelor's degree in computer science um
4:07 I moved to another city it it all was
4:09 also kind of spontaneous and very uh the
4:13 school was also a bachelor level no it
4:16 was uh it was like a trade school so I
4:19 finished like 12th grade got my all my
4:21 exams done and also additionally kind of
4:24 this web design um profession
4:26 professional education mhm so so in
4:30 computer science yeah I did bachelors in
4:32 another city in Lea that's in L and yeah
4:37 it was just nice I I enjoyed it a lot U
4:41 after getting my degree I went directly
4:43 to Accenture to do the boot camp for
4:45 programmers in C++ actually C++ was my
4:49 favorite language I had a really good
4:51 teacher and uh yeah it helped me a lot I
4:54 think my teacher just saved my life or
4:56 built my career in some in some way cuz
4:59 uh yeah in this boot camp um I was the
5:02 only girl I think it was like 22 guys
5:05 and me and uh they took in into
5:08 internship six of us so that's how I got
5:12 into Accenture my first project was not
5:14 C++ at all it was python actually and it
5:17 was after C+ plus everything is easy
5:20 right yeah yeah exactly like python was
5:24 just a nice you know and uh it was I was
5:28 working for Nokia I was an intern for
5:30 Nokia for six months and then Nokia you
5:33 know got some bankrupt bankruptcy I
5:35 don't know what happened really but they
5:36 completely closed the project so 60
5:39 people who were working in this project
5:40 had to be distributed in in kind of
5:43 around you know around the place in
5:45 other departments and uh actually all
5:48 the interns they went into devops they
5:51 put us into devops DeVos was something
5:52 completely new like a couple of months
5:54 before that it was called Pro no
5:57 configuration management and all of of a
5:59 sudden this devops word appeared you
6:01 know and I was sitting all of a sudden
6:03 this devops like basement we didn't even
6:06 have like our team was maximum 10 people
6:08 and we were just sitting you know in a
6:09 basement doing some
6:11 Automation and that's how it started
6:13 actually after this devops grew so big
6:15 in couple of years I think it was we had
6:17 our own office like we were 100 people
6:20 like already in the so it was a
6:24 beginning of devops and I I think I
6:25 managed to be at the right time at the
6:28 right spot with that I worked on two
6:31 projects so first got me the first
6:33 promotion and the second project already
6:35 I was for four years I was traveling to
6:37 Germany my like onsite um I was every
6:42 Monday I was going to Germany Thursday
6:43 back and like a lot of
6:46 traveling and after four years in those
6:48 projects I was already leading the team
6:50 supporting project managers directly
6:52 like working with the with the clients
6:54 and the reporting planning everything uh
6:57 kind of that is Project related on the
7:00 side of this project and I got a
7:03 burnout so my burnout was really heavy
7:06 like they wanted to promote me again I
7:08 said there is no money that can that can
7:10 absolutely that can make me stay you
7:12 know like no money in the world can make
7:14 stay at work and uh yeah I kind of went
7:17 into this self-searching trip to
7:20 Bulgaria there was
7:22 volunteering for an arasmus plus this
7:24 was my first encounter and kind of um my
7:28 first contact with arasmus Plus World
7:30 and facilitation what is Erasmus Plus
7:33 it's like a master degree or Erasmus
7:36 Plus is like um Program for Young People
7:39 to to go also educational so it's
7:42 traveling and you you you travel for any
7:45 kind of educational purposes for 10 days
7:48 to 20 10 days so it's not like uh a big
7:51 thing no it's not long usually it's
7:54 something uh very short and offers so
7:58 many arasmus things like arasmus usual
8:00 arasmus is like when you do Bachelor you
8:02 can spend a semester abroad right then
8:05 there is arasmus Mundus which is um the
8:07 program I took part which is like more
8:09 like a master's program you study in
8:11 multiple universities so now there is
8:13 also Rasmus plus that I heard I think
8:15 there are other erasmos something
8:17 programs yeah yeah yeah there are many
8:20 actually I just I don't even know all of
8:22 them but there is for sure youth
8:23 exchanges where younger people go uh
8:25 training courses is for already
8:27 Educators and volunteering where you go
8:30 for one month and you can help like on
8:32 the spot so this was when I found out
8:34 about this and I was 30 usually it's up
8:37 to 30 when you can travel you know so I
8:40 just got to know at the last moment of
8:43 my life you know when when I can I could
8:44 join so one year I spent volunteering
8:47 coordinating these Rasmus plus projects
8:50 then I went to then I started I kept
8:53 volunteering I just stayed in Bulgaria I
8:55 I kept volunteering I don't know how
8:56 where my money was coming from to be
8:58 honest now in rospective I was living
9:01 really well like everything was fine but
9:03 I was volunteering for really three
9:05 years because I couldn't make myself to
9:06 go back to to it or any kind of work so
9:10 you you're not sure how you survived
9:13 this years yeah I don't know but was
9:15 always
9:17 money yeah I wish it was always the
9:20 case yeah and I was at some point I also
9:22 worked as a community manager so my
9:24 friends offered me uh like um a job as a
9:27 community manager in one office like a
9:30 co-working space it's called the
9:33 networking premium and this got gave me
9:36 a really crucial important you know like
9:39 kind experience in my CV of a community
9:42 manager which after already VMware found
9:46 me and they offered me they kind of
9:48 found me they were looking for a
9:49 technical person with Community
9:51 management experience they offered me
9:53 this position in Bulgaria I said I'm
9:56 moving to to Portugal no matter what so
9:59 like I was already on the move and they
10:01 they found a way to to hire me in
10:04 Portugal so I was doing this um
10:07 Community Management for VMware already
10:09 open source project like traveling for
10:11 conferences and so on Project was called
10:14 versatile date
10:16 kit and uh yeah then kind of VMware got
10:20 sold they they they let go every single
10:23 person that was working in Portugal
10:24 because we it was only eight of us and
10:27 uh that's how actually I am I got laid
10:30 off which is a perfect case scenario for
10:32 me to be honest and yeah I did meanwhile
10:35 I did also while working there
10:37 certification for facilitator and I
10:40 started also doing and facilitating
10:42 these arasmus plus projects on the side
10:44 kind of on in my free
10:46 time and now as I'm completely free
10:49 since I think it was March when uh they
10:53 they closed that they they let me
10:55 go uh since then I I opened an NGO
10:58 myself to write these arasmus plus
11:01 projects with the purpose of inclusion
11:03 also and doing some work here in PTO
11:06 between the experts and locals and now
11:09 I'm also starting in January mentorship
11:13 for kids uh like
11:15 for maybe teenagers between I think 10
11:18 and 16 of like also career choices so
11:21 that's how it's
11:22 moving so while you were sharing your
11:25 story and This Is Amazing by the way uh
11:28 really interesting and inspiring so
11:29 while you were sharing your story I was
11:31 thinking like maybe we should have
11:32 called this uh interview like first I
11:35 was thinking maybe from waitress to
11:37 devops lead but then I was thinking from
11:39 waitress to community manager now I'm
11:42 not sure because like there are so many
11:44 different things you've done um exactly
11:47 for you like you really liked
11:50 um volunteering in Rasmus plus that's
11:53 why you're kind of you're still doing
11:56 that right even now yeah I'm doing that
11:58 because it's the most it's just coming
12:00 like uh I was I just wanted to see if
12:04 I'm good at this you know like I
12:06 sometimes test things and I think it's
12:07 really important to know if I'm good at
12:09 it like art okay art prove me no
12:12 programming yes you know and then like
12:14 um facilitation seems like yes and
12:17 people are inviting me and they want me
12:18 to do this so it's like I I'm basing my
12:22 also my my my journey on where the
12:26 energy is where it's positive you know
12:29 where energy is positive okay so how
12:33 does it work like how do you test and
12:34 how do you see whe the energy is
12:37 positive or negative and what does it
12:38 even mean to have positive energy I
12:41 wouldn't say that it's positive or
12:43 negative but the the theory is very
12:46 simple do I like it and I'm and am I
12:49 good at it like uh if it is the case I'm
12:53 going to enjoy my time doing that thing
12:56 and that's very simple I think if I'm
12:58 sitting and doing something and the time
13:00 flies by it's a really really big sign
13:03 that this is something that I'm supposed
13:05 to do supposed to be
13:07 doing I think it's called the getting
13:10 into the flow right flow yeah yeah yeah
13:12 there is a whole theory of
13:15 flow but like you you aren't necessarily
13:18 good at it at the
13:20 beginning actually I it turns out that
13:23 in some things like I am good at it in
13:25 the beginning I just kind of have some
13:27 mindset to to do this programming like
13:30 my story exactly on how I discovered
13:32 that I'm good at programming is our
13:34 teacher just gave us a task to calculate
13:37 something it's like a very simple for
13:39 Loop that we had to write and he left
13:41 the room and he said when I come back in
13:42 10 minutes I will check whoever uh manag
13:45 to solve this problem is going to get
13:47 like the highest grade and everyone else
13:49 just doesn't get anything and I was the
13:51 only person in the room who solved it so
13:54 I figured oh I must be good at it okay
13:57 you know yeah well what was the
14:00 problem it was we had to just very
14:02 simply calculate some sequence of some
14:05 numbers and get like I don't know 1,000
14:07 number if you like do some sum or it was
14:10 very basic very very basic thing but uh
14:13 uh like in order to solve it we had to
14:15 write like some kind of loop or for Loop
14:17 or like some calculation there so it it
14:20 was very simple but I was the only
14:22 person yeah to solve it so I was
14:25 like that's cool
14:29 and um so like I'm checking at what
14:33 johana prepared and actually she uh went
14:36 through your liin profile and found many
14:40 interesting things there uh and yeah I
14:42 by the way checked also like you speak
14:44 Russian for example this is something we
14:45 talked before um so and then um so for
14:49 example you shared that you got a
14:51 promotion after you automated yourself
14:53 out of your project so you created a
14:55 pipeline that uh basically did um your
14:59 work so can you share more about that
15:02 yeah so that was the first project like
15:04 uh the first project when I joined as
15:07 centure already as an employee was a
15:10 very yeah it was okay so just my first
15:14 day I I joined this project and they
15:15 gave me like seven printed pages that I
15:18 have to repetitively do and again and
15:21 again and every day and this was like a
15:24 migration I think of some kind of um
15:26 version of spring to to a higher version
15:28 of spring so some files need to be
15:29 changed some some things need to REM
15:32 named and and so on and some some things
15:34 need to be tested on Linux and windows
15:36 and so on so I was doing this for the
15:39 first two days in order just to go
15:40 through the
15:42 instructions and uh I think within a
15:44 week I already learned how to do it but
15:47 let's say my the time of doing this is
15:50 is like it takes a lot of time it is
15:52 extremely repetitive and I realize that
15:54 I can also make a lot of human error
15:56 like for example I'm just copying
15:58 folders and renaming them I you know
16:01 like I realized that's very simple it's
16:03 I can just write a code to to to move
16:05 these folders and rename them right so I
16:07 did that okay it it takes a little bit
16:10 more time to to automate right so maybe
16:12 I was a bit behind kind of my tasks but
16:15 uh after I automated it I don't have to
16:17 worry about it and then one by one like
16:19 piece by piece I automated the whole
16:22 thing the whole process obviously if
16:24 something can be written on the paper it
16:26 can be I think written as a code like
16:30 it is very yeah exactly so I think they
16:34 were not expecting this okay so like by
16:37 the end of three months I think the the
16:40 whole process was automated so that it
16:41 can I think each or I I was already an
16:46 employee but that was like first yeah
16:49 first first like your position was like
16:52 Junior devops engineer something like
16:53 this yeah like Jun engineer
16:56 exactly okay so yeah I I think they were
16:59 just like there are projects where
17:00 people are doing daily tasks you know
17:02 and I'm not sure if these daily tasks
17:05 are like this that you repeat something
17:07 but basically after three months I had
17:09 nothing to do there and they were like
17:11 they were so impressed by this that okay
17:14 like we want to keep you for one more
17:15 month they kept me but there was
17:17 absolutely nothing already to do there
17:19 was nothing to fix nothing to improve
17:21 like uh
17:23 and yeah and they gave me you know like
17:26 ex centure you you're writing your own
17:28 goals and then you are getting
17:29 evaluation and I got evaluation like
17:32 above expectations like on each criteria
17:35 that I set
17:37 there so yeah that's was and like
17:40 usually the promotion comes after at
17:42 least one year of work but I think it
17:45 was five months and the the main lead of
17:48 of our like of the whole technical like
17:51 uh Department wrote to my career
17:53 counselor he said uh tell a to do her
17:57 there there's some learning to do you
17:59 know like I have to complete the
18:01 learning I'm get getting promoted and I
18:03 was like you know nice okay I did
18:06 everything you know so within even less
18:08 than one year I was already
18:10 promoted so uh like when you mentioned
18:13 spring migration it gave me some sort of
18:16 PTSD cuz like I was a Java developer at
18:18 some point and of course there was
18:19 spring and uh uh back then uh we didn't
18:23 really have like this kind of support of
18:25 uh devops Engineers who would do this
18:28 sort of a ations so yeah this is
18:30 something I had to do
18:32 myself so you had to work with Java
18:34 right yeah but I have never learned Java
18:37 like I don't know Java trust me like I
18:39 look at Java and it's extremely
18:41 difficult I try to do a course in Java
18:43 like during that time when I was in that
18:45 project but it's just not my thing like
18:49 and and I I I was using like um yeah I
18:52 was using some scripts I didn't have to
18:54 actually use Java itself so I didn't
18:57 have to know the the order to work with
18:59 it yeah would you say as a devops
19:02 engineer or like any some sort of like
19:04 platform engineer or
19:06 S and do you need to know the language
19:10 in which the the platform you support
19:13 the system you support is written no
19:16 absolutely not and and I could say that
19:18 I even didn't know sometimes the
19:20 language that I'm going to be working in
19:22 because every tool like every single uh
19:26 like um framework that exists is using
19:29 some other like maybe language then at
19:33 some point it was Ruby kind of Ruby like
19:35 I was working with chat I was learning
19:37 everything as like I said like maybe
19:39 like you said after after C++ everything
19:41 is possible yeah right I think I just
19:45 know I understand the basics so I can
19:47 use whatever tool or language I need in
19:51 order to achieve my goal if I understand
19:53 So eventually my I I think I understood
19:55 about myself that my skill is problem
19:58 solving and then the means that I can
20:00 use are just
20:03 secondary problem solving this is
20:04 something that I see often see in uh job
20:08 descriptions like okay you need to be a
20:10 good Problem Solver but like what does
20:11 it actually mean and I was always
20:13 wondering cuz like okay there's a
20:15 problem and you solve it but like how do
20:17 you even test it and how can you claim
20:19 that you're a good Problem
20:21 Solver yeah it's it's still also a
20:25 question to me I think that I am kind of
20:27 getting the clues that it might be the
20:29 case you know like I enjoy
20:31 problems maybe that's why I know that
20:34 I'm solving them a problem is like a
20:36 challenge rather than a problem exactly
20:40 yeah and then um with devops since you
20:44 are not doing this and then you said you
20:47 uh burnt out you couldn't do any devops
20:49 you couldn't look at this and like no
20:50 money could change your mind so you went
20:53 um um volunteering but probably you
20:57 acquired some very useful skills
20:59 as a devops and so what was that in your
21:03 opinion I think in general not just as a
21:06 devop like my whole corporate experience
21:08 gave me a lot of professionalism I
21:11 understand how the processes are really
21:14 good how documentation is really
21:16 important like people in NGS they don't
21:19 understand this like most of the time
21:20 everything is get being very chaotically
21:23 you know not managed and so on so when I
21:25 joined that NGO I was actually introduc
21:28 in the same I was doing not not like jir
21:31 but for example I introduced the ticket
21:32 system like I introduced documentation I
21:35 introduced like processes you know so
21:38 all of the things that are also agile
21:40 kind of processes everything is so
21:42 useful like retrospectives plannings
21:45 like everything that is happening I
21:48 think in in a corporate it is extremely
21:50 extremely useful and helpful for for for
21:54 all sorts of purposes and especially
21:57 problem solving also like
21:59 right like basically organizational
22:01 skills in the s in the sense like okay
22:03 there is a problem how do we approach
22:05 solving it or not a problem but a set of
22:08 problems like or a project like how do
22:11 we complete the project kind of project
22:13 management skills way exactly it's
22:16 project manager skills because when I
22:17 was already uh volunteering there uh at
22:20 some point I joined this open Bulgaria
22:22 project and it was completely new so we
22:24 were building a website for foreigners
22:26 to find information about living in
22:28 bulgar moving in Bulgaria all sorts of
22:30 things and it was from zero right so we
22:32 were creating it is completely
22:34 volunteers based like that volunteers
22:37 are writing articles and how it's going
22:39 to be like how are we going to do this
22:41 and at some point I I think I used all
22:43 my skills like they hired me kind of
22:45 hired me in the team as a lead project
22:48 manager and uh I was just um yeah trying
22:51 to make it uh tried to trying to create
22:55 a system for this to work continuously
22:58 and
22:59 ably and uh like were these projects
23:02 mostly IT projects or they were also
23:04 some physical projects phical in a sense
23:07 that you don't need to it was like you
23:09 needed to program something usually
23:11 right yeah I wasn't programming there
23:13 was another person programming but I
23:15 mean like plural you as a team yeah
23:18 exactly MH yeah and then managing people
23:22 kind of the team of writers who are
23:24 writing the the content for that website
23:28 and um I guess managing you were also
23:32 managing people as a deop lead right
23:35 before yes I was I was I think I think
23:38 maybe a team of 12 people we were doing
23:41 support and the devop development and
23:44 support two by two like weeks so yeah so
23:47 in your experience like managing
23:49 volunteers and managing usually in place
23:52 uh how is it
23:54 different H volunteering is a very you
23:58 know it's a you don't have to be at work
24:00 you don't have to check in you know it's
24:02 like
24:03 very fluid and and then it all B it all
24:08 based on motivation yeah yeah and
24:11 motivating people is the main I think
24:13 question how to motivate people to do to
24:16 do
24:17 something and to believe that this is
24:20 this is good you know that they would
24:22 like to spend their free time on this
24:24 also open source it's the same open
24:26 source if if it's a project completely
24:29 let's say without any kind of develop
24:31 developer team it is completely
24:33 volunteer based so that connects
24:37 also yeah cuz like when you manage
24:39 volunteers you don't actually like I
24:42 don't know if even the word manage is
24:45 the right word right because like you're
24:47 not a manager to them technically right
24:50 no just structure we just structure them
24:52 like we gave them the structure when
24:54 they want to Rite they pick up a task
24:55 and then they can in their own pace
24:57 executed and when it's in some certain
25:00 State there comes a volunteer editor and
25:02 then they you know they they they check
25:04 it and so on so process so if somebody
25:08 wants to do something like that let's
25:09 say I don't know I work as a Java
25:11 developer and I'm tired of my work I
25:13 cannot look at Java code anymore and I
25:15 want to do something like that what how
25:16 do I go about
25:19 that H like a wering you mean like you
25:24 said you didn't need to worry about
25:26 money for three years and it kind of
25:27 sounds a
25:29 feeling yeah okay that's a good
25:33 question actually like to me how I found
25:36 it is was just I was uh looking for I
25:40 think I was in that expats group and
25:42 then I found the opportunity and you
25:45 know like later I'm going to talk maybe
25:47 about a bit about personality types and
25:49 and traits and stuff like that and my
25:52 type like in mbti let's say uh is kind
25:55 of the one that is seeing opportunity
25:59 so when I see the opportunity I take it
26:01 you know like and I see them everywhere
26:03 for example I meet you you know like uh
26:05 I don't know why but that that time when
26:07 I went for the dinner you know when we
26:09 met it was just a feeling that it's it's
26:12 good to be there it's like an
26:14 opportunity you know that's a good
26:15 feeling yeah
26:18 yeah okay seeing
26:22 opportunities so this H personality type
26:24 is like this four-letter abbreviation
26:27 that's yeah you can see sometimes
26:29 somewhere like one is introverted
26:31 extroverted and the other three I don't
26:34 remember introvert extrovert sensing
26:37 feeling prospecting judging yeah I don't
26:40 remember all all of them also but yeah
26:44 do you think this is like an actually uh
26:47 useful thing to know your personality
26:49 type I think yes I also know that some
26:52 companies are um typing people before
26:56 putting them in themes because let's say
26:59 I am uh one of the
27:01 types I really alone I really don't work
27:05 as as well as combined with another
27:08 complimentary type so they usually put
27:11 like a person who is more communicative
27:13 with with a person maybe who is more
27:15 like uh yeah introverts and extroverts
27:17 like you have if you have people team of
27:20 six people there is a perfect
27:21 combination of types like if you put
27:23 them they're going to work and perform
27:25 like perfectly together I I heard this
27:27 in also in
27:29 conference uh this particular set of
27:31 types that that work perfectly together
27:34 and I think it's it's good to know
27:35 because it's just a a bit of
27:38 selfawareness you know of self self
27:42 yeah self-
27:44 knowledge yeah interesting uh because
27:47 like for me it's
27:49 uh more like a fun thing to do but I
27:52 never actually used this so at work like
27:56 previously when I was working at uh
27:58 company we had uh Team buildings and
28:01 sometimes these team buildings were um
28:04 would get together in a room and there
28:06 was a facilitator who would help us
28:08 figure out the personality types of each
28:10 other so now like the idea behind that
28:13 is you kind of learn more about each
28:14 other uh because you discover your own
28:19 personality type with your team by
28:22 answering questions and then you kind of
28:25 I don't remember how exactly it was
28:26 organized but then like you understand
28:28 okay this person uh doesn't like talking
28:32 to people right so then you understand
28:34 why they're always know wearing
28:36 headphones or whatever um so it was kind
28:40 of fun but then uh practically I don't
28:42 think anything changed actually after
28:44 that
28:46 so yeah I think it maybe creates a
28:48 little bit more empathy I think maybe
28:50 you can understand that not every single
28:52 person is like you like for me in my
28:54 case I I think that sometimes some of
28:58 the things that we are really good at or
29:00 like our minds are working perfectly
29:02 fluently in some direction it's very
29:04 easy to assume that everyone sees the
29:06 world exactly like that for example I'm
29:09 very spontaneous and I can change my
29:11 plans any moment and for some people
29:13 it's so difficult to to accept this you
29:16 know like yeah yeah I need to plan like
29:19 one week ahead you see and I'm like no
29:21 no no I just read the questions
29:23 yesterday you know and so I'm
29:26 here yeah
29:28 okay yeah it's it's it's really well
29:30 it's I think it's really good to to
29:32 understand that there are different
29:33 types of people and each person is
29:36 really uh functioning in different ways
29:38 in order to function a little bit better
29:41 with
29:41 them and you published an article or
29:44 articles and one of them is what
29:46 personality traits are best suited for
29:49 date engineering so what are those yeah
29:53 that's on my based on my personal
29:55 opinion completely and experience with
29:59 working with people that are dat
30:00 engineers and in general also devops of
30:02 course I had some genius people I think
30:05 that were just
30:07 perfectly yeah suited well suited for
30:09 this basically I understand that for
30:11 myself I am not a data engineer and I
30:14 cannot be because I lack persistence I
30:17 lack the detail oriented mindset that
30:21 let's say for the
30:23 data to show some answers to some
30:25 questions right which like usually we
30:27 read the date in order to to understand
30:29 some things and make decisions based on
30:31 that I think it needs to be very very
30:34 precise and I think that the person
30:36 needs to be very interested in in
30:38 finding that Precision that that is
30:41 relevant for the data to give those
30:44 answers and in my like I am obviously
30:49 not that person like there could be
30:51 irrational and irrational type so I am
30:53 irrational and
30:54 illogical so iral
30:59 exactly it means that I'm more intuitive
31:01 and kind of you know fluent spontaneous
31:04 spontaneous and intuitive and uh yeah I
31:07 am absolutely not as detail oriented and
31:12 persistent uh to to to yeah to deliver
31:15 that that job so I could and I was also
31:19 working on my own like when I was
31:20 working in the ver dat kit I had to
31:23 create the the charts like I had to
31:25 create the code the pipeline for my own
31:26 reports so for the community stat
31:29 statistics right and I was sitting on it
31:32 and I love it of course this is so
31:33 interesting to me when I see my charts
31:35 like I see how many people came to my
31:37 repository how many stars I get over
31:40 time like when I get these beautiful you
31:42 know like charts I'm done but maybe if
31:45 they are not really precise or
31:46 something's not working I really don't
31:48 want to go back there and fix it and
31:50 yeah it's
31:51 about it's more like you like uh
31:55 creating something new but maintaining
31:57 is less fun for you Absolut absolutely
31:59 not fun it's just a
32:02 pain and there are people for who it's
32:05 the other way around yeah I think that
32:07 there are people who really enjoy that
32:09 they enjoy to to create like perfect
32:12 systems that work and show exactly the
32:15 like the details like in every every
32:17 single part of the data that might be
32:19 necessary and they want to really make
32:21 it yeah they want to make it perfect you
32:24 know like this perfectionism
32:26 perfectionism sometimes is really really
32:28 good to to have in the team like like if
32:31 that person is data engineer I would say
32:33 that they're instantly genius if if the
32:35 person just already intrinsically wants
32:38 to be very detail
32:41 oriented and would you say that uh if we
32:44 take like a backend engineer who works
32:46 in I don't know Java or python and a DAT
32:50 engineer do they need different
32:54 personality types to in order to do
32:57 their work or or maybe it's not as
32:59 important maybe it's not as important I
33:02 I think that there are two yeah I think
33:06 that Engineers they share the same it's
33:07 just that where the interest here the
33:09 question is going to be about what is
33:11 more interesting for them and and that
33:14 is there is an answer usually in what
33:16 they're do what they're researching and
33:18 what kind of uh what are they reading
33:21 when they are into into kind of their it
33:25 on their free time you know like for
33:27 example know I think my my first best
33:30 friend when I just joined Accenture was
33:32 really on his free time like okay so
33:34 he's working already he's programming
33:36 right during the day and then he's going
33:37 back home and he's like researching
33:40 conferences about the like Security in
33:43 uh it security you know like this is
33:46 100% two signs like that he loves it
33:49 he's doing it on his free time and this
33:51 is his topic so that's just this person
33:53 is has full potential to become
33:56 extremely genius at it but then yeah
34:00 yeah right because like I was uh we were
34:03 discussing this and I'm of course was
34:05 thinking about myself cuz originally my
34:07 background is a Java developer but then
34:09 I became a data scientist but I never
34:10 really became a data scientist in the
34:12 sense that uh you know data people and
34:15 data scientist specifically they like to
34:18 do a lot of analytics they like to do a
34:20 lot of
34:21 experimenting and I was
34:23 more focused on was more interested in
34:26 the engineering aspects of that even
34:27 though my title was data scientist I
34:30 didn't really enjoy this part of you
34:32 know digging into Data then trying to
34:35 build like the best model then I was
34:38 like okay we have a model how do I go
34:40 about putting this into production and
34:43 probably this is because of the
34:45 personality type is more like engineer
34:48 engineering oriented rather than
34:49 research
34:51 oriented yeah actually when I was
34:53 reading about this there are two types I
34:55 don't remember exactly maybe I Des cried
34:58 better in the article because there are
35:00 exactly these two two that are maybe
35:03 logical both of them I think need to be
35:05 logical like one is logical and
35:07 opportunity also you see opportunity in
35:09 where to put these things and the other
35:11 one is going to be rational and logical
35:13 so they're going to be very into
35:15 analysis this is like I'm now thinking
35:18 about this because both of them are
35:20 really good at data engineering or or in
35:23 general I guess engineering but uh
35:26 yeah I also typed all my
35:30 colleagues like I asked them to to feel
35:32 the the the test and then I then if I on
35:35 found out that usually it's like one or
35:37 the other one so yeah I was basing also
35:40 my my whole article based on the actual
35:42 people that I was working with and I was
35:45 working with data engineering team like
35:47 purely data engineering and one was
35:49 developers so so that was at VMware
35:53 where you were a community manager yeah
35:56 yeah it was a good theme I love I love
35:58 to work with those people yeah so
36:00 between the vmw between PMW and you work
36:03 as a community engine Community manager
36:06 and devops Engineering being a devops
36:08 lead it was a gap not a gap like U you
36:12 took like three years of this work right
36:16 of paid work yeah okay like was it
36:19 difficult for you to actually come back
36:21 to corporate environment after 3 years
36:23 of
36:24 volunteering yeah um it was not
36:28 difficult exactly because I I already
36:30 set for myself like um kind of
36:34 um criteria I said for myself that I
36:38 will only work in a project only if it's
36:40 open source and it was an open source
36:43 they found me so they they unbored me
36:45 they unbored me already in my kind of uh
36:49 Community like already in more with
36:51 people you know working with people
36:53 because I realized that yeah there is
36:55 something that is about me this kind of
36:58 technical part right but actually I
37:00 enjoy more working with people and
37:04 managing team like any kind of
37:06 management and people problem solving
37:09 for me is way more interesting and
37:11 that's how Community came in so they
37:13 hired me on both like already I was
37:15 progressing slowly into facilitation and
37:17 people kind of process and community
37:20 community building also so it was just a
37:24 perfect like transition into something
37:26 already that was my my next step so it
37:29 wasn't difficult it was just um perfect
37:32 logical conclusion you know like or
37:35 progress what is does it actually mean
37:38 to be a community manager I also
37:40 consider myself a community manager then
37:43 you worked as a community manager and
37:45 then if we we also talked about
37:47 theworking space there we also have
37:49 Community managers but I assume that uh
37:52 sometimes you you can take two people
37:55 whose titles are Community managers but
37:57 they do completely different things mhm
37:59 I think that also works like for data
38:01 scientists and pretty much everyone else
38:03 but like what exactly did you
38:05 do yeah yeah I I would say that the
38:08 common things are actually um social
38:11 media I really was not expecting this my
38:14 maybe my goal when when I'm thinking
38:16 about Community is to kind of bring
38:18 people together and you know do some
38:20 team building like community building
38:22 something that they get to know each
38:24 other and then things start making or
38:28 becoming more fluent because the people
38:30 are
38:30 communicating but most of the the stuff
38:33 in both actually in um co-working space
38:36 and both in
38:37 um um open source project I was uh doing
38:43 LinkedIn Twitter Meetup platform in the
38:47 coworking space and Facebook I was
38:50 creating all the texts yeah it's I was
38:53 creating all the texts and and YouTube
38:55 of course I was also doing once a month
38:57 like a YouTube community meeting and
39:00 writing blogs so basically it's content
39:03 content content and I realized that
39:06 there is more content creation than
39:08 actually talking or communication with
39:10 people but communication of course is
39:12 the most maybe
39:13 important so it sounds like a developer
39:16 relations kind of position exactly and
39:20 someone afterwards after I was
39:21 describing I think I got a like a random
39:24 guest in my house you know one day
39:26 brought by a friend and she told me
39:28 hearing me out a little bit she said
39:30 this is what uh devel is doing so I
39:34 should probably go in that direction she
39:36 told
39:38 me
39:40 it what do you mean but by that like is
39:43 if your future career progression she
39:46 told me that it's the best uh option for
39:49 me because probably the the salary is
39:51 higher she told me that I'm probably
39:54 getting under PA paid just because my
39:56 position is called community manager ah
39:58 that was a completely also an assumption
40:01 I also don't know but uh yeah MH she
40:04 strongly recommended you
40:06 know so there was uh not a lot of
40:10 community building but more like
40:12 marketing activities in order for in
40:16 order to promote the open source product
40:18 right exactly and but did you need to
40:20 talk to users or things like that yeah I
40:23 was talking to users these Community
40:25 meetings maybe were one thing uh talking
40:28 at conferences and just visiting
40:29 conferences is another um and I enjoyed
40:33 maybe the most actually onsite team
40:36 buildings I I was allowed to facilitate
40:39 for my team a goal setting process for
40:42 actually unifying our ideas about the
40:45 the product because at some point we
40:47 were just making it more more more
40:49 versatile you know versatile it we were
40:51 just adding features features features
40:53 but at some point we had to sit down and
40:54 realize that it's not very easy to
40:56 install maybe we should just you know
40:58 work on Basics and it was the best I
41:01 think process ever we we set a vision
41:03 you know like what do we want this
41:06 product to feel for us like what is
41:08 important and then the whole team
41:10 together we said easy we want it to be
41:13 easy and uh yeah I I think I got really
41:16 lucky that I I was I was there and I I I
41:19 was trusted by my team too to facilitate
41:22 this process of um generating
41:25 ideas think just maybe for comparison so
41:29 what I do is as I also prefer to call
41:31 myself Community manager so it's mostly
41:33 organizing different things like
41:35 organizing uh things like what we have
41:39 right now even though the questions were
41:40 prepared by Hana but still like I ask to
41:43 reach out to your to you uh then set up
41:46 a date uh it's organizing like different
41:50 things in the
41:51 community or uh courses or things like
41:55 this it's mostly I wouldn't call it like
41:57 product management project management or
41:59 anything like that it's more like okay
42:02 like we have a bunch of people who are
42:03 interested in doing different things
42:05 what we can how can we entertain
42:08 them was it how can we bring them
42:10 together in my opinion together yeah
42:13 exactly I think that people want to be
42:15 together and they want to do things
42:16 together and then we have great excuses
42:19 to do those things right and if if those
42:21 things are meaningful I think um they
42:24 bring more people and that's just it now
42:27 my NGO I also I'm realizing this it's
42:29 just a a really great excuse to to come
42:32 together and to do something so tell us
42:35 more about that what do you do in your n
42:37 and how did maybe we can start from uh
42:41 so was it may or March when you said
42:44 like uh VMware made this decision to uh
42:48 Let It Go and it December now yeah so
42:53 what happened like how did you came uh
42:57 to this decision to start an NGO and why
43:01 this particular type of NGO on activity
43:04 yeah so NGO is not an easy uh thing to
43:07 open at least not in Portugal I don't
43:09 know how about other countries but we
43:11 needed eight PE nine people in
43:13 total
43:15 so yeah so it wasn't it it didn't start
43:19 in March I I kind of I was already doing
43:22 this course
43:24 for career coaching or career course for
43:28 maybe two
43:29 years um on my own not not on my own but
43:33 with a friend we were we were doing you
43:35 were learning how to be a career coach
43:38 or you were coached by a career coach I
43:41 was leading with this gal therapist girl
43:44 that I mentioned in the very beginning I
43:46 was leading two day courses for people
43:50 like facilitating them
43:52 to go through several process and
43:55 methods to
43:58 career coach yeah exactly to understand
44:01 maybe their kind of career move or like
44:04 uh how to align it was literally called
44:07 align your career with who you are and
44:09 we have a specific methods and tools
44:11 that we use that people are going
44:13 through through a process that by the
44:15 end of these two days they they kind of
44:19 understand is it for what is their next
44:22 step for it or it's very general
44:24 anything anything yeah so like I
44:27 I don't know I graduate from school I
44:29 have no idea what to do my parents uh
44:31 one of my parents says you need to study
44:34 medicine the other parent says you need
44:35 to go to do it and I don't like any of
44:38 these options so then I go to to that
44:42 kind of course yeah uhhuh yeah best case
44:45 scenario like sometimes it happened that
44:47 people came when they are already burned
44:49 out or they really hate already their
44:51 job you know like sometimes people come
44:54 when they are understand that yeah
44:57 moment when they're quitting and
44:58 something new needs to start like I
44:59 can't continue the way that it
45:02 was so yeah and actually in this course
45:05 like while we were doing it we met
45:06 several people who are on the same wave
45:08 you know like we were really all in kind
45:11 of this Erasmus Plus or inclusion or
45:14 like events uh creation and um one by
45:18 one like I don't know we kind of started
45:21 you know a little Community it wasn't
45:22 intentional it was just absolutely
45:24 spontaneous we got together
45:27 these nine people and we wanted to do
45:29 something bigger and uh yeah that's how
45:32 in may we we actually established we
45:35 went through this whole process we
45:36 needed first of course some Portuguese
45:39 person who understands Portuguese law
45:41 like and all the legal you know systems
45:44 and parts of it like and people who
45:48 might be wanting to be willing to be
45:51 like a Treasurer a president you know
45:53 and and so on and the assembly board you
45:55 know like
45:57 a big deal it it's not it was like a
46:00 really difficult preparation maybe but
46:04 now it's done yeah all the paperwork it
46:06 took us like six months maybe to go
46:08 through because then we need to write
46:10 regulations and approve them and so on
46:13 so that's how it started it started
46:15 already some while ago when we met these
46:17 people one by one we met them from
46:20 different events and things that we were
46:22 doing with Julia with this girl uh that
46:26 we are working working kind of together
46:27 and um yeah just from this community
46:31 it's
46:33 Pond interesting and what we're doing
46:35 yeah we set for ourselves a goal like
46:38 inclusion gender equality and
46:42 sustainability so gender equality I
46:44 understand inclusion is for people for
46:48 expert for experts to be to feel more
46:51 included right I think it's important at
46:54 least in Portugal I noticed that there
46:56 is um divide for sure experts are
47:00 hanging out only with experts and you
47:02 know it's really difficult to to meet
47:04 local people I think it's probably in
47:07 any country yeah like in Germany I
47:09 mostly hang out in my own bubble and
47:12 this
47:13 bubble usually does not include Germans
47:17 most of the
47:18 time yeah yeah it's exactly the case so
47:21 we wanted to create some events or like
47:23 places where it would be interesting for
47:25 locals also to join
47:27 just to get to know you know to because
47:30 the the stereotypes about foreigners is
47:32 basically you know that foreigners come
47:34 and rent extremely expensive Apartments
47:37 here and then the price increase so
47:39 we're kind of the evil ones but actually
47:43 yeah just to get to know you know when
47:44 you get to know people you understand
47:46 their motivations you can also ask them
47:48 why they're here like you know how how
47:50 these things I think just communication
47:52 between expert and Opel is really really
47:54 important because every single person is
47:57 who is here and is dedicated to to
47:59 improve the something in the place where
48:03 they live you know is bringing um
48:05 bringing some contribution value some
48:08 value to to the to the place so that's
48:11 inclusion then you have gender in
48:12 equality and the last one was
48:14 sustainability sustainability yeah we're
48:16 not doing at the moment so much with
48:18 sustainability but uh yeah it's in the
48:20 plan I don't know how like how it's
48:23 going to evolve but let's see what
48:25 exactly what is mean in Practical terms
48:28 like what like I am an expert expert I
48:31 come to Porto and I come across your
48:35 community what do I get from there you
48:38 can just join you join the event usually
48:41 that's the the the user Journey let's
48:42 say you just join the event and then
48:45 like a me meetup group or yeah on the
48:48 Meetup and then if you like you you just
48:50 stick around like you can become a
48:52 member we can we are now recruiting like
48:55 board members not board members but
48:57 assembly members MH uh the people who
49:00 are going to be even making decisions
49:02 like on broader scale like with us where
49:04 we going together as a as a as an
49:08 NGO and what do you do on these Meetup
49:12 meetups uh we do all sorts of things
49:14 each of us I think has a separate or
49:16 like different skill one girl is a this
49:18 kind of U improv theater we have a an
49:21 older man from the US he's doing mbti
49:24 and um storytelling uh what is was it
49:30 what is MBTA mbti is this personality
49:34 type is this 16 personality this sort of
49:37 thing we talked about like this
49:38 four-letter thing is yeah combinations
49:41 yeah yeah and uh then yeah uh then
49:47 another girl is doing this gell theater
49:50 I'm doing community
49:52 buildings yeah so each person is doing
49:54 something and we are just offering this
49:56 kind events okay so I
49:58 come and then I see group of people and
50:01 everyone says like if you're interested
50:03 in this come here yeah okay like that
50:08 and then they really want to usually
50:10 people stay and we we keep doing it's
50:13 like when there is something interesting
50:15 happening I think and really meaningful
50:18 people want to want to stick around
50:20 really just and that's how we grew from
50:23 you know two to to n and now we are
50:25 already like 10 11 12 and so it's just
50:29 slowly growing but it's a local physical
50:32 right community so it's not online at
50:34 all MH so it has nothing to do with it
50:38 or anything so it's not
50:40 uh no not whatsoever MH cuz I imagine
50:44 that many of the exports are
50:47 actually uh some sort of developers or
50:49 something like that at least in Germany
50:51 maybe because it's again uh the bias of
50:54 my own bubble but when I meet somebody
50:57 who is like I don't know speaks Russian
51:01 um they if they are from Russia often
51:04 times it's it people like developers it
51:07 is it is the case in my also experience
51:09 it is the case because like for for us
51:12 it's easier to move around like all you
51:14 need is laptop
51:17 right I see yeah okay and uh you said
51:21 that you know the image of a foreigner
51:24 is maybe if we again talk about the it
51:26 people so they usually have good money
51:29 so they come to I don't know Porto rent
51:31 rent expensive Apartments the prices go
51:34 up um and locals do not necessarily like
51:38 them for that right yeah I think it's
51:42 because yeah of the just lack of actual
51:45 direct contact so it's like the prices
51:48 are growing someone must be uh someone
51:52 must be responsible for
51:55 this and you don't live in Porto right
51:57 you live outside no I live yeah yeah
52:01 okay I live a bit outside of the port of
52:03 Porto I I'm I'm kind of leading to the
52:07 story you shared in that um dat dinner
52:12 yes I am yeah I'm I bought actually
52:15 thanks to VMware I managed to thanks to
52:18 my layoff I managed to buy a piece of
52:21 land in forest and I'm now yeah building
52:24 I built a dome there and I'm moving I I
52:26 am I have completely moved there I have
52:29 given up all the other options all
52:31 options B and C you know that I had in
52:34 Porto are now closed so I am fully fully
52:38 living of Grid in in a
52:41 forest so you are in the forest right
52:44 now now now right now no I came to a
52:47 friend just because I was a bit worried
52:48 about the internet
52:50 connection but um yeah and how is the
52:54 Internet connection typically
52:57 actually it's okay I was yeah I just
52:59 maybe worried a bit too much just for
53:02 the sake of not you know having any
53:04 technical issues I usually have all my
53:07 calls there and so on just but you know
53:10 it's better to be safe than
53:12 sorry so you live in a forest and ofre
53:16 means that you need to produce your own
53:18 electricity get your own water and take
53:22 care of the garbage and like all this
53:24 sort of stuff right or all the sort of
53:26 things
53:27 exactly yeah so the electricity part is
53:30 done I have a solar panel and batteries
53:33 and so
53:34 on and then uh yeah the water I'm still
53:37 kind of buying um I want to
53:41 install colle like water collector I
53:43 don't know how you call it but like a
53:45 big kind
53:46 of big can that is collecting rain water
53:50 yeah that can be filtered and and used
53:52 and also drill a hole but this for that
53:55 I need uh to to go through some legal
53:57 process so I'm still in process so you
54:00 have an in that project it's a it's a
54:04 it's a very long term I think it's yeah
54:07 my life project so to say we can say
54:09 yeah right right um do you encounter
54:13 like wild animals
54:15 there I'm observing animals it's just
54:19 that I first saw like some insects then
54:21 I saw some slugs then I saw one lizard
54:25 you know and I saw one
54:27 snake like but not no bigger I maybe saw
54:30 one squirrel one time they are passing
54:33 by but it's not absolutely not yeah
54:36 there are not too many animals cuz like
54:39 I also even in the city I
54:41 see well here in Berlin I don't see
54:44 lizard but like in France they are
54:46 everywhere or in
54:48 Italy no no I've seen only I think one
54:51 one lizard I like lizards a lot
54:56 cool uh yeah that's that's really
54:59 impressive like that one thing I
55:00 remember from that dinner is like you're
55:02 leing off the greet and I was like wow
55:04 that is
55:07 brave it's an experiment you know life
55:10 is an experiment I want to see how it
55:12 how it goes because
55:14 um yeah it's going to be interesting if
55:17 I can if I can live like this I mean I
55:20 can always you know change my mind I can
55:22 always sell it I can always like or I
55:24 can always upgrade you know I can always
55:26 get a better house I can always get a
55:28 better heating you know or better
55:30 something else that's always a question
55:33 but at the moment for me it's like what
55:35 is the bare minimum like that I can live
55:38 with that I'm comfortable but uh not
55:41 yeah like that I'm comfortable with or
55:43 is it even possible you know so it's
55:46 going to be an interesting interesting
55:48 journey I think this winter particularly
55:50 I'm really curious and in terms of money
55:53 you need to spend on that is it cheaper
55:55 than renting a um an apartment in port
55:57 cuz I that Port is becoming quite
56:00 expensive it is expensive yeah now I was
56:03 paying for the room 550 I think
56:06 including uh like everything but now
56:09 there I'm paying like 300 something so
56:12 it is cheaper well yeah I'm paying a bit
56:14 for gas so but that I would I would be
56:17 paying probably anyway yeah right um so
56:21 I think we still have uh time for one
56:23 more question and uh like we didn't
56:26 cover everything um but one thing that
56:29 uh I really wanted to ask you is um
56:33 there was a post from you on
56:35 LinkedIn where you said you you were
56:38 doing a brainstorming
56:39 party
56:41 so what was
56:43 that a brainstorming party like how does
56:45 it even look like yeah I'm going to
56:48 explain it was like my unemployment
56:50 party unemployment party okay yeah I
56:53 like yeah when I got to Paradise I
56:56 realized that I need to use my own
56:58 methods for myself so usually in my
57:01 course we do like you know based on
57:03 values like what is the core value of
57:05 the person then there is like uh um kind
57:08 of um six logical levels you know when
57:11 they go through six questions that tell
57:13 them what is their purpose of life and
57:15 then the next one is like when you know
57:16 everything like it's just a mastermind
57:19 uh Mastermind uh kind of um technique I
57:23 I don't know maybe you you know about
57:25 this it's like when a bunch of people
57:27 come and they brainstorm for one person
57:29 so I say my current challenge is this
57:31 for example my current challenge is
57:34 that I am I am unemployed I have I have
57:37 this I have Forest like I say all my
57:39 reality check right I I live in a forest
57:42 I'm unemployed I have all these these
57:43 these these skills like um I have
57:47 um that much money you know like savings
57:49 I have that much time that I could just
57:51 spend you know now for example without a
57:53 job and what would you do if you were in
57:56 my place and it is really important that
57:59 uh I I think I asked this question in a
58:02 sense what would you do if you were in
58:05 this situation you know not not like oh
58:08 I think you should be doing this but
58:10 like each person when they think about
58:12 themselves they think from their
58:13 perspective so instantly already their
58:15 perspective is on like if I would be in
58:18 this uh position I would do this and
58:21 then each person gives me some some
58:23 ideas you know they they take like
58:25 sticky notes and then the right like if
58:27 I would be in that position I would do
58:29 this and then like each person just gave
58:31 me their their ideas
58:33 and what they would do if they would be
58:36 exactly at that moment exactly in that
58:38 situation and yeah was really really
58:40 useful I love this process a lot and I
58:43 started actually facilitating after that
58:45 just these Mastermind groups also um for
58:50 yeah for this purpose because it's
58:52 always lovely it's always lovely and
58:53 it's always really really useful and so
58:56 always really energizing people to to
58:59 hear uh other let's say possibilities
59:03 and options for them how other people
59:06 see see those things this is so amazing
59:09 and like unemployment party just the
59:12 name is already so
59:15 cool how did you
59:19 even could think of a think like that
59:22 like it's not something like you just
59:23 wake up and thought okay yeah I want to
59:25 throw an an employment party today and
59:28 this is exactly what we're going to do
59:30 there right so there has to be a process
59:33 how you arrived at this particular
59:35 structure of the event yeah well so the
59:38 first thing was that I really was
59:40 unemployed right so I was basically just
59:43 a just just quit my job or whatever like
59:47 I was laid off and uh what was my
59:50 thinking is that I need my own medicine
59:53 you know like I am creating these spaces
59:55 usually for these masterminds for other
59:57 people and this is the first time I
59:59 really need to hear my friends that I
1:00:02 really trust to tell me what to do like
1:00:05 to to share their ideas and um that was
1:00:09 the the basic the basic idea I really
1:00:11 understood okay I need this so what do I
1:00:13 do okay I gather them so how do I call
1:00:16 this okay I call this party yeah what
1:00:19 what kind of party okay it's the party
1:00:20 is because I'm unemployed so let's talk
1:00:22 about that you know like it's just a
1:00:24 very kind of for me very logical secrets
1:00:27 from okay I'm unemployed I need this
1:00:29 like let's gather did you have the let's
1:00:32 say traditional quot party aspects
1:00:36 there like I don't know food like food
1:00:39 yeah exactly we had food okay it wasn't
1:00:42 just brainstorming we had food yeah we
1:00:45 just yeah had some drinks some chat and
1:00:47 then we sat down in the circle like and
1:00:50 and then I told my whole story since I
1:00:52 arrived in Porto until until that moment
1:00:56 that's cool okay I see at the time and
1:01:00 we
1:01:01 are taking a bit longer but yeah so we
1:01:04 should be wrapping up and it's been an
1:01:06 amazing conversation like always thanks
