2:35 actually is one of the first people who
2:37 joined data talks club i think uh maybe
2:40 you were one of the first 10 or
2:41 20 something like this and i remember
2:43 asking you some tips
2:46 because your title is uh
2:49 checked your linkedin and it was uh

3:01 grow the community
3:03 and arpet is also a founder the founder
3:06 of data led academy which is at the go
3:08 place for any
3:09 everybody who is interested in data who

3:26 answers so welcome arbit
3:28 yeah thank you uh thanks alexey for the
3:30 for the intro excited to be here
3:32 uh thanks for having me i think uh data
3:34 talks is a really great community
3:36 um excited to be part of it and just to
3:39 let people know that data academy is not
3:41 exactly a
3:42 community it's not a slack community but
3:44 essentially it's a place to uh
3:46 learn how to work with data so we have
3:47 like a lot of free learning content
3:50 um and then we're also creating a
3:52 repository of you know common questions
3:53 that people have about
3:55 tools technologies people and processes
3:57 related to data so you can like
3:58 go and find uh these these uh you know
4:01 answers to those questions there
4:03 um so excited to be here thanks again
4:06 and
4:06 you also have a podcast which you yeah
4:09 yeah
4:09 so we have a podcast called yeah it's
4:12 actually called the datalit professional
4:13 uh so you can check out the podcast on
4:16 our website data.academy
4:18 podcast um and we basically talk about
4:20 different data related topics
4:22 uh primarily focused on topics that are
4:25 relevant for
4:27 uh i like to use term less technical
4:29 people people who are not exactly
4:31 uh data engineer the data analysts of
4:33 course they can also benefit from the
4:35 content but our core audience is
4:36 basically
4:37 uh people working in product growth and
4:39 operations roles or marketing
4:40 uh who want to basically learn about
4:42 data and like you know different data
4:43 related topics
4:44 um and typically you know our goal is to
4:47 answer
4:48 again common questions that people have
4:50 um about
4:51 about data yes
4:55 so before we go into our main topic of
4:57 uh datalet of becoming datalit
5:00 uh maybe we can start with your
5:01 background um can you tell us
5:03 about your career journey so far yeah
5:06 absolutely yeah so so basically
5:08 i've been working in the technology
5:10 industry for for pretty much the whole
5:12 my whole career but i've sort of you
5:14 know worked
5:15 in in different types of companies uh i
5:18 really got into the data space uh
5:20 when i when i i was basically working as
5:22 a consultant and you know i was building
5:25 a lot of integrations for smbs um and
5:28 that led me to to integra maths i was
5:30 a user of integramer integramer is a is
5:32 an ipod solution like
5:34 like work auto tray zapier etc
5:37 and i was like one of the earliest
5:39 people who joined the integromat team
5:41 i actually built the integrometric
5:42 community and then eventually i led
5:44 growth at integromet um i moved on from
5:48 integromet
5:48 uh soon after i got acquired late last
5:51 year
5:52 uh since then i worked with a few other
5:54 companies
5:55 um basically again companies in the data
5:58 space solving different
5:59 problems in the you know customer data
6:02 infrastructure
6:03 sort of space um and and um and now
6:06 i'm building data led academy well but
6:08 also you know working with
6:10 a few data companies helping them with
6:12 their content and community strategy for
6:14 me
6:14 content communities is really uh is all
6:17 i've been doing
6:17 you know like integra so uh content
6:20 community
6:21 is what helped us grow um really really
6:23 fast
6:24 and um and and it's really important for
6:27 for
6:27 uh you know especially data companies to
6:30 build
6:30 their presence across different
6:32 communities where
6:34 where their prospects customers partners
6:36 hang out communities like datatalks.club
6:39 um you know instead of building a new
6:41 community a lot of people are building
6:42 new communities but
6:43 i believe that there are already a lot
6:45 of great communities
6:46 and um and that's why i i like to you
6:49 know be active
6:50 in existing communities um and and
6:53 that's
6:53 that's the idea behind netanyahu academy
6:56 to not
6:57 build another community but but
6:58 basically sort of
7:00 create a place where people can um get
7:03 get concrete it's expert actionable on
7:05 uh actionable answers expert unbiased
7:08 actual
7:08 answers to their questions uh a lot of
7:10 these answers are basically answered by
7:12 experts
7:13 uh who are from these communities so
7:16 yeah that's that's a bit about
7:18 my background
7:21 yeah thanks uh so as uh
7:24 so this term growth and this is
7:26 something you did
7:29 within the grammar so i was curious what
7:32 actually growth managers do
7:33 and when i checked it's very uh
7:37 it's uh very dated even i don't know how
7:39 to describe but they use a lot of data
7:41 so
7:41 um judging like when i look at the title
7:44 growth manager
7:45 or growth market marketing it doesn't
7:48 sound
7:49 too data related to me but when i
7:51 actually read and they
7:52 they run a lot of baby tests they need
7:54 to make a lot of decisions all these
7:55 decisions are based on data uh
7:58 yeah so i guess this is how you um
8:01 you ended up creating this uh datalit
8:04 academy right so because you saw how it
8:06 is useful
8:07 uh okay yeah yeah without data you can't
8:10 really
8:11 i mean there's only so much you can do i
8:13 shouldn't say you can't do anything but
8:14 there's only so much you can do
8:16 uh like uh in simple terms like if you
8:18 don't have data
8:19 uh when you're building growth
8:21 experiences whether it's for
8:23 you know acquisition activation uh or
8:25 retention or whatever
8:26 you're without data you'd be forced to
8:28 build linear experiences you know like
8:31 every customer irrespective of their
8:33 behavior
8:33 uh they will go through the same path
8:35 right but when you have data you can
8:37 actually create
8:38 personalized experiences where customers
8:40 are prospects will
8:42 see content or interact with your
8:44 product
8:45 based on you know where they come from
8:47 what their industry is and
8:49 and how they basically interact with
8:50 your product uh so that is the main
8:52 difference
8:53 and and it's very hard for for growth
8:55 professionals or even product managers
8:58 to to really you know uh build
9:01 personalized customer experiences across
9:04 different custom you know across
9:06 different
9:07 touch points and channels without having
9:10 access to data
9:11 and having access to data in the tools
9:13 that they use
9:14 it's not just enough to have access to
9:16 data in a data warehouse or a bi tool
9:19 it's more important than ever to have
9:20 access data in the tools that they use
9:22 to build and craft these uh customer
9:25 experiences
9:27 so tools that marketers use to make
9:30 different decisions right
9:32 because they cannot just go and uh or
9:34 most of
9:35 them probably i don't know um but most
9:37 of the marketers i worked with they
9:39 cannot just go and
9:41 run a sql query in uh yeah in a database
9:44 right saying they need help for that
9:47 yeah marketers growth professionals
9:48 product people operations people
9:51 they they need not really know how to
9:53 write sql of course if they know it's an
9:55 advantage but uh um there are a lot of
9:58 great tools out there that allow you to
9:59 you know
9:59 visually query the data and so if the
10:02 data is made available then
10:04 then they can easily sort of use the
10:06 data uh for
10:07 for their their uh for for whatever
10:10 they're doing so whether it's
10:11 uh uh creating in-app experiences or
10:15 or creating lifecycle email campaigns or
10:18 um you know doing ap tests like you
10:20 mentioned um
10:22 or doing like an sms campaign for
10:24 example
10:25 um irrespective of the channel that
10:27 they're using to
10:28 engage with customers they can sort of
10:30 use
10:31 this data if the data is available in
10:33 the tools that they use
10:34 um yeah
10:38 so what is datalet so uh
10:41 i think you have a definition right so
10:43 what is that
10:44 yeah yeah so my definition of data layer
10:47 is basically
10:48 a data like professional data led person
10:50 is someone who
10:51 who understands where where data comes
10:53 from what it looks like
10:55 um they're able to question its accuracy
10:57 you know not just blindly believe
10:59 the data that they see so if they
11:00 understand where data comes from and
11:02 where it looks like
11:03 uh they'll be able to question is
11:04 accuracy and then of course they are
11:06 comfortable working with data
11:09 and you know they have the skills to
11:11 build their experiences powered by data
11:14 so so it sounds like you know a lot but
11:17 essentially it's
11:18 you don't really need a technical
11:20 background i would say to
11:21 to know any of this stuff to understand
11:23 where data comes from what it looks like
11:25 the question is accuracy and to
11:28 basically work with data to build
11:29 data experiences
11:33 is there any difference between being
11:35 data driven and dataled
11:38 data driven is something i hear quite
11:40 often
11:41 and to be honest i still have no idea
11:43 what it actually means
11:44 i think sometimes it's used like a
11:46 buzzword
11:49 data driven and what does it mean and
11:52 yeah maybe you can just explain a bit
11:54 what it means and what are the
11:56 differences between data driven
11:57 and data light if there are any
11:59 differences yeah yeah
12:01 uh like you said it is sort of a
12:03 buzzword
12:04 but like how i like to think of data
12:06 driven is basically
12:07 uh to base decisions exclusively on
12:10 available data
12:11 you know every company wants to be data
12:13 driven so they they're investing heavily
12:15 in their infrastructure
12:16 uh once data is available they they want
12:18 to like
12:20 like to be data driven would be to do
12:22 not again question
12:23 the accuracy of the data and uh not use
12:26 your intuition and experience
12:27 before making decisions you know like uh
12:30 data is all about making decisions it
12:32 helps you
12:32 good data helps you make good decisions
12:34 but
12:35 you cannot always blindly follow what
12:38 data tells you because
12:39 you know like there are there's so many
12:41 ways um
12:42 you know the data that you see can be
12:45 inaccurate um there are so many data
12:46 quality issues that can be there
12:48 um so it's important to to basically
12:51 combine
12:52 your intuition your experience along
12:54 with the data that you see so that i
12:56 would say the difference between
12:58 being your driven versus being data led
13:00 where your
13:01 data is leading you or guiding you
13:03 rather rather than
13:04 just you know telling you just you know
13:06 blindly phoning what data tells you
13:09 so it's uh that part uh when you said
13:12 like data that professionally somebody
13:14 who knows understands where the data
13:16 comes from
13:17 can question uh its accuracy and
13:20 comfortable working with data so i guess
13:22 the
13:23 the second point about questioning is
13:25 the main uh
13:26 the main factor that say that uh
13:29 differentiating factor right between
13:31 these two
13:33 yeah yeah and you can only question this
13:35 accuracy if you if you understand
13:37 you know where data has been collected
13:38 or how it is being collected
13:40 uh if nothing is documented you can't
13:43 really understand anything so you can't
13:44 really
13:45 question it so it's very important to
13:47 have um you know
13:48 proper documentation on on your on your
13:51 data sources
13:52 uh one of the things that we talk a lot
13:54 about especially in the context of
13:55 product and growth
13:56 is having a data tracking plan uh which
13:58 essentially is a it could be a simple
14:00 google doc
14:01 a google sheet or you know there are
14:03 purpose built tools now to create your
14:05 tracking plans
14:06 where you uh define every event that has
14:09 been captured
14:10 um and and you know related properties
14:13 that are being captured and
14:14 even the data types of each property so
14:16 when these things are
14:17 are well defined um any product or
14:20 growth professional can can look at that
14:22 that information and understand that
14:24 okay this event
14:26 is captured when someone performed this
14:28 particular action
14:29 you know the sign up event is is
14:31 captured when someone
14:32 uh not just submits the sign up form but
14:34 when when when
14:36 when the sign up is completed rather
14:38 than just
14:39 you know being a client-side event
14:41 versus being a service server-side event
14:43 so uh when you specify these things
14:45 you've enabled people to
14:46 to understand where data comes from you
14:48 know um
14:50 so that's really important like uh
14:51 documenting everything
14:53 uh to be able to like you know pass on
14:55 that knowledge to others because
14:57 you know the person who would implement
14:58 it they they cannot be around forever to
15:01 to explain to people you know where the
15:03 data is coming from
15:04 but once you have that understanding
15:06 then then you are able to
15:07 question the accuracy when you see uh an
15:10 anomaly when you see that the data
15:12 doesn't look right
15:13 you can actually you know go and like
15:15 drill down and figure out what the issue
15:17 is
15:17 um instead of just flying blind or just
15:20 you know blindly trusting what you see
15:24 so for this um so i mentioned this data
15:27 tracking plan and the document
15:29 which describes all these events so how
15:32 do you
15:33 uh like when do you actually need to do
15:35 this so let's say you're
15:37 uh is it for startups or is it from
15:39 mature organizations like uh
15:41 i guess uh for any type of company they
15:44 already have some data sources so
15:46 something is already going on on the
15:48 platform and then
15:50 they hire i don't know a growth marketer
15:52 right somebody who comes in and
15:54 now needs to uh make decisions based on
15:57 data
15:57 right and uh and
16:01 yes so i would say it depends i mean
16:04 depends on the stage of the company like
16:06 i've seen some big companies not having
16:09 a tracking plan at all
16:10 which is a problem so essentially every
16:12 company that has has a tech product or a
16:15 tech enabled product or even an
16:16 e-commerce business
16:18 needs to have this documented uh whether
16:20 it's a tracking plan or
16:22 uh some companies use users like other
16:24 different like different tools to
16:25 sort of document this it used to use the
16:27 visual tools like miro and stuff
16:29 um so it's usually done even before you
16:33 instrument
16:34 uh you know like data before you set up
16:37 instrumentation before you
16:38 uh set up the products so
16:41 instrumentation in the sense like
16:42 uh before you set up let's say a product
16:44 analytics tool or any
16:46 any tool that that that depends on event
16:49 data
16:50 um you instrument uh your product events
16:53 you know like
16:54 the the the process of tracking uh
16:57 product data
16:58 is often referred to as instrumentation
17:00 um so this is
17:02 usually done again there's no rule when
17:05 it's done but
17:06 it's typically done when companies are
17:07 ready to sort of invest in
17:09 uh product analytics tools or or like uh
17:12 other other event based engagement tools
17:14 like customer io brace
17:16 etc sector there are so many tools where
17:18 you can like you know use events to
17:20 personalize customer experiences
17:22 so um and this is something that
17:25 obviously is relevant to startups as
17:26 well as big companies
17:27 um also with with big companies because
17:30 at a big company if you don't have
17:32 have this stuff documented like like
17:35 people will new people will come in and
17:37 they'll have no idea uh what to do with
17:39 with your with the tools
17:41 they see a bunch of like events let's
17:43 say in intercom
17:44 uh and they're supposed to create some
17:47 uh you know in-app experiences or some
17:49 email campaigns
17:50 but they won't know what an event means
17:52 right uh
17:53 or they might see conflicting events
17:55 they might see an event called signed up
17:57 another event called
17:58 um you know signed up with a different
18:00 casing um
18:02 so so all of those issues sort of come
18:04 up if you don't have things
18:05 documented and well instrumented so um
18:09 like i would recommend every company to
18:12 do this sooner rather than later
18:14 because um of course you need to sort of
18:16 have customers and you need to have
18:18 users to be able to
18:20 uh you know make sense of this data you
18:22 set it up but there won't be any data to
18:24 analyze or act upon so
18:28 i i think i mentioned to this growth
18:30 marketer but there are any
18:32 there are a lot of different users of
18:33 data so we have the data analysts we
18:35 have
18:36 product managers uh basically everyone
18:38 who needs to make a decision
18:39 certain decision on data they would need
18:41 to to analyze the data and they
18:44 need to understand the
18:47 each event right so what is the origin
18:49 of this event
18:50 and i think you mentioned if they see
18:53 something strange
18:54 in the data they need to be able to
18:56 question this okay
18:57 like uh there is a spike in i don't know
18:59 registrations or something like this or
19:01 in certain type of event
19:03 okay what does it mean right and then
19:05 they would be able to go and
19:08 drill in and understand what what's
19:10 happening right
19:12 yeah absolutely an example would be
19:14 unless you see a spike a ridiculous
19:16 spike in your signups
19:18 uh and you know that it doesn't look
19:20 right if you have
19:21 the event instrumented properly and
19:23 you're also capturing
19:25 relevant properties with that event you
19:27 can actually figure out where the
19:28 signups are coming from
19:30 um and oftentimes you might realize that
19:32 you know these are like fake signups so
19:34 like what's
19:34 uh something a lot of companies that we
19:36 have been experiencing so you'd be able
19:38 to do that
19:38 um another thing that i would like to
19:41 mention is that you mentioned product
19:42 growth and we've been talking about
19:43 product marketing growth people but uh
19:46 product data are evented are extremely
19:47 useful
19:48 for even for sales people today uh so
19:50 sales people look at a crm
19:52 uh they look at you know data about a
19:55 company or about
19:56 a prospect um but when they have access
19:58 to product data where they can see what
20:00 a prospect
20:01 uh in the trial period is doing inside
20:03 the product it gives them more
20:05 more context and then they can like go
20:07 after the right accounts rather than
20:09 you know again just going after
20:10 everybody with the prospect in their crm
20:13 when they see that you know this
20:14 particular account has you know uh they
20:16 already have five users in their account
20:18 and they've already gone ahead and like
20:20 you know performed a bunch of actions
20:22 if it's a project management tool
20:23 they've already gone ahead and created a
20:24 project
20:25 and created a bunch of tasks um so now
20:27 would be a good time to sort of
20:29 reach out to them versus just again
20:32 reaching out to everybody
20:34 who just shows up in your crm and you
20:36 know maybe based on
20:37 the company side or whatever so it's
20:40 extremely useful for
20:42 for for even for sales or um yeah sales
20:45 and beauty people so
20:49 um this is very important to document
20:52 your data
20:53 right and we discussed i think you
20:54 mentioned that you can do this with miro
20:57 uh i think i saw some things like that
21:01 in uh like just an exposed excel
21:04 spreadsheet
21:04 or yeah excel but maybe google
21:06 spreadsheet like some online
21:08 spreadsheets
21:09 are there any special tools for that or
21:12 people use whatever they are comfortable
21:14 with now
21:16 so now there are like purpose built
21:17 tools for that so uh there's one called
21:20 uh avo so avo there's another one called
21:22 iteratively
21:23 uh there's the new one called trackplane
21:25 i can send share these names on slack
21:28 so you know people can explore these
21:29 tools but these are actually tools that
21:31 are
21:33 especially built for companies to create
21:35 their tracking plan in a collaborative
21:36 manner
21:37 rather than relying on a spreadsheet so
21:39 they obviously have a lot of you know
21:41 features that are really useful that
21:43 enable you to maintain data quality
21:44 maintain a taxonomy
21:46 um you know like collaborate on each
21:49 event a lot of times
21:50 you you might describe an event and and
21:52 the developer who's supposed to
21:54 instrument it
21:55 uh they might have questions about that
21:56 event so you can like discuss stuff
21:58 uh so these tools are really really
22:00 useful i would say otherwise exploring
22:04 so i'm i'm so you said a developer who
22:07 is supposed to instrument this event so
22:09 the way i
22:10 interpret i interpret it the way i
22:12 understand it is uh
22:13 so first you create this tracking plan
22:15 right so you
22:16 um you take you write down
22:20 all the events all the type of ones you
22:22 want to capture it doesn't mean you
22:24 capture them yet yeah but you want to
22:26 start tracking them right
22:27 and then there is a developer or maybe a
22:30 mobile developer yes some engineer
22:34 who now needs to go and implement this
22:36 to start tracking this data right yes
22:39 so because the data doesn't just appear
22:41 magically on your dashboard
22:43 right and then you make a decision you
22:45 actually need to capture this data
22:47 and to do many many other things right
22:49 so maybe we can
22:50 talk a bit uh about this like okay now
22:54 we have a tracking plan
22:55 and now a developer uh
22:58 we tell the developer hey can you please
23:00 instrument this event can we start
23:02 collecting them
23:03 and then we have the other end of uh
23:05 this is like
23:07 an analyst or somebody is looking on the
23:09 dashboard
23:10 and now can make a decision like this
23:12 campaign
23:13 uh this type of campaign this variant of
23:15 the campaign is better than this variant
23:17 of campaign right
23:18 so then we can make a decision and there
23:20 is a a
23:22 big like a lot of things happen between
23:24 these two have
23:25 these two right so yeah absolutely so
23:29 i would say like data collection is the
23:31 first step and and even before
23:33 you know like let's talk about a startup
23:35 um that doesn't have any any data
23:37 infrastructure in place uh
23:39 let's think of a sas product could be a
23:41 project management tool or
23:42 an invoicing tool um before you
23:45 implement
23:46 uh any any any tools any like product
23:48 analytics tools or
23:50 any tools that rely on data you need to
23:52 first create a tracking plan and
23:53 describe you know all the events that
23:55 you want to capture and then
23:56 uh describe all uh the properties you
23:58 want to capture with every event
23:59 you also want to describe your your user
24:01 properties and you also want to describe
24:03 uh organization or account properties so
24:05 all the different
24:06 pieces of data that you ideally want to
24:08 collect and
24:09 uh this is really important because when
24:11 you start doing this you you feel like
24:13 you want to collect this also and that
24:15 also you might end up with like
24:16 50 events um and which is great but the
24:19 next step is to
24:20 basically remove all the events that you
24:22 don't need in the
24:24 near future because you know having too
24:26 much data at the beginning is
24:27 like one of the biggest uh issues it
24:30 also obviously takes more time to
24:32 implement it takes more time to test so
24:34 like
24:35 bring it down to like seven or ten
24:37 events that you really really need to
24:38 understand
24:39 the customer journey from acquisition to
24:41 activation
24:43 maybe you can think of some examples so
24:45 you said like a sas product
24:46 which could be a product a project
24:49 management tool or
24:50 account like accounting tool or
24:52 something like this yeah so
24:53 it's a yes yeah so
24:57 yeah i was going to suggest maybe we can
24:59 take one of the tools i think it you set
25:01 invoicing to
25:02 that probably makes let's take let's
25:04 take project management okay
25:08 so you start by you start by obviously
25:10 tracking your
25:11 sign up event you know um sometimes i i
25:14 recommend people to even track
25:15 uh the event which is email verified
25:18 because you know uh
25:19 depending on how you sign up flow is you
25:20 might not always you might have people
25:23 who
25:23 will sign up but they don't end up
25:24 verifying your email so it's useful to
25:26 have that because you might want to like
25:28 create some emails based on that event
25:31 so like sign up email verified
25:33 um if it's a project management tool
25:35 obviously the one of the first thing is
25:36 to create a project
25:38 and then add uh invite to user because
25:40 you know
25:41 a project management tool is no good if
25:42 you don't if someone doesn't invite
25:44 another user to work with
25:46 so like you know project created user
25:48 invited uh those would be like
25:50 the core events that you track and then
25:51 of course you also want to see
25:53 uh whether they create a task so you
25:54 know task created
25:56 if it's an invoicing tool again it could
25:58 be uh an invoice created
26:00 or or like uh with an invoicing tool you
26:02 probably add a client
26:03 so it could be client added or client
26:06 created and then
26:07 invoice created and then you to maybe
26:09 again invite
26:10 your colleagues so user invited so these
26:12 are the most common events
26:14 um um so yeah like you you definitely
26:17 start with these for each event you'd
26:19 describe relevant properties uh so for
26:22 the sign up event you you obviously want
26:23 to describe
26:24 um the user's name and email but also uh
26:28 if you're if you're asking the user so
26:29 let's say there's a signups form where
26:31 you're asking the user
26:32 which industry they belong to um and
26:34 what is their roles you definitely want
26:35 to capture that
26:37 information uh alongside that event so
26:39 stuff like that
26:40 um so yeah once you have that once
26:43 you're happy with your
26:44 but once you're happy with your events
26:46 that's that's when you you basically
26:48 bring in
26:48 an engineer and then you basically
26:50 discuss it with them uh get their
26:52 feedback of course engineers have a lot
26:54 of good feedback
26:55 um you get their feedback polish your
26:57 tracking plan
26:58 once you agree upon it you you basically
27:00 even like i
27:01 highly recommend you to even describe
27:03 for every event described
27:05 as a client segment or a server-side
27:06 event that's really really important
27:08 it's obviously
27:09 now better to track more immense server
27:12 side
27:12 but uh you might want to track some
27:14 client-side events so it's important to
27:16 describe that so that
27:17 you know what's the difference like sign
27:20 up with
27:20 a client side or server side so it
27:23 depends how
27:24 how how you end up implementing it right
27:26 like if you're tracking a client side
27:28 the event will be fired as soon as
27:29 someone clicks the sign up button you
27:31 know submits the form
27:32 uh but if you're tracking the server
27:34 side and only be fired once
27:36 the signup process is actually completed
27:37 one once that user is actually added in
27:39 your database you know like
27:41 a lot of times a lot you know user will
27:42 click that sign up button and there'll
27:44 be an error
27:45 that you need to then there might be a
27:46 validation error that you know your
27:47 password is not right or email is not
27:49 right
27:50 but the event will be fired so you might
27:52 see a sign up whereas
27:53 an actual signup hasn't even taken place
27:55 right so
27:56 uh so you'd ideally track their server
27:58 side but there might be
28:00 uh for some use cases for for tracking
28:03 client-side events
28:04 um where you actually want to track if
28:06 someone clicked a button
28:07 uh this is usually useful inside your
28:10 app if you want to see if someone
28:11 uh tried clicking on a button uh to use
28:13 the feature uh even if they don't don't
28:15 use the feature you want to know that
28:16 someone
28:17 actually tried using it so that's like
28:19 useful information for you
28:20 so that could be a a client-side event
28:24 yeah
28:26 um so yeah once you have that i would
28:28 recommend that you know
28:29 once you start working with with your
28:30 engineers um often there might be
28:33 multiple engineers involved so you
28:34 should even specify
28:35 you know which engineer which engineer
28:37 is going to
28:38 implement which events you can have a
28:40 column or you can specify
28:42 who owns which event um once you have
28:45 everything done and once you
28:46 actually have data flowing in um you're
28:49 actually sort of
28:50 done with the with the collection stage
28:52 uh the next step is to obviously make
28:54 sure that
28:55 this data that has been collected has
28:56 been stored in a warehouse
28:58 um of course for for all these early
29:00 stage startups it
29:01 might not be possible to to set up a
29:04 warehouse always
29:05 you know it's not hard at all to set up
29:06 awareness today it's also very
29:07 affordable
29:08 uh so it's very it's highly recommended
29:10 to to store
29:12 this event data or product data anywhere
29:14 else because
29:15 if you don't you you'd obviously be
29:17 sending it to let's say a product
29:18 analytics tool like click mix panel
29:20 or amplitude or whatever and a few other
29:24 tools but you won't really have access
29:26 to this raw event data to be used in the
29:28 future
29:29 so uh highly recommended that you store
29:31 it
29:32 and then of course you want to analyze
29:34 this data typically
29:36 event data is analyzed in a product
29:37 analytics tool some people
29:39 also end up doing this in a bi tool but
29:42 uh bi tools are not
29:44 you know purpose built to analyze event
29:46 data so
29:47 uh you'd obviously sort of need need an
29:50 analyst who would have to write a
29:52 whole bunch of uh sql queries to
29:55 to actually create let's say a simple
29:57 funnel uh report in a bi tool
29:59 that you could do in a product analytics
30:01 tool with a few clicks
30:02 so um irrespective of the tools you're
30:05 using to analyze the data
30:06 you you basically analyze it and you
30:08 derive insights uh
30:10 from from the data and then of course
30:12 you want to activate that data or act
30:14 upon that data
30:15 and that's obviously the most important
30:16 thing like you can't just look at data
30:18 and be happy with it you need to do
30:20 something about it
30:22 and that's when um data activation sort
30:24 of comes into place
30:26 uh and once this data is available in
30:28 your activation tools
30:29 uh your email tools your your support
30:32 tools uh support is a really good use
30:34 case
30:35 like something that a lot of people
30:36 don't think about but if you make
30:38 this event data available in your
30:40 support tools you actually enable
30:42 your support teams to actually see what
30:44 users have done in the product
30:46 so they don't have to like you know ask
30:48 people uh whether someone opens the
30:50 ticket they don't have to reply saying
30:51 hey did you try doing this or did you
30:53 try doing that or can you try doing this
30:54 because
30:55 they can actually see uh the different
30:57 events that users have performed
30:58 so they don't have to you know you can
31:00 provide better support there are
31:02 companies who actually
31:03 have this because all my experience with
31:07 customer support
31:08 uh
31:11 more and more companies realize the
31:13 importance of this is just
31:14 obviously you know it's not a priority
31:17 for most companies but uh of course
31:18 there are many companies
31:20 uh that provide great support they have
31:22 this and it's really not hard once you
31:24 have
31:24 the data you just have to sort of send
31:26 this data to zendesk or whatever
31:28 uh support tool you're using um so
31:31 that's the thing with data right like
31:33 every company or let's say 100 different
31:36 companies
31:36 will have access to this data but maybe
31:38 only five of them
31:39 are actually using this data across
31:41 different sort of channels and
31:43 and making this data available to
31:45 different teams right
31:47 uh even the sales example is really
31:49 important uh useful
31:50 um since people don't generally have
31:53 access to product data
31:55 in the tools that they use right but now
31:57 more and more companies realize that
31:59 the importance of this and now there are
32:01 like a new breed of companies that have
32:03 that have come
32:03 up they're building sort of uh
32:06 these these new tools which are now sort
32:09 of dubbed as
32:10 crm 2.0 tools where uh sales people can
32:14 can uh actually access product data and
32:17 and
32:17 um you know be more sort of responsive
32:21 uh and like they don't have to just
32:23 create sort of these linear experiences
32:25 so
32:25 um so yeah uh once you once your once
32:29 you have the data and the right tools
32:30 you can activate the data
32:31 and you can you know build these a
32:33 really good personalized customer
32:34 experiences
32:35 and then of course you can send this
32:36 data back to your product and and
32:38 personalize
32:39 uh the product experience also you know
32:42 based on
32:42 uh like i think hubspot is a really good
32:45 example
32:46 are there a bunch of other companies
32:47 that do this really well where
32:49 uh the way people experience the product
32:51 is also depend
32:52 it is also sort of personalized based on
32:56 what they've done earlier in the product
32:58 you know so
32:59 that is that is the the ultimate sort of
33:02 uh destination
33:04 where where you're not just like
33:05 analyzing data and using it
33:07 to create experience outside your
33:09 product but also
33:11 inside your product um it's worth
33:13 mentioning that
33:14 uh tools like amplitude which is
33:16 obviously one of the
33:17 most popular product analytics tool uh
33:20 has
33:21 launched a new sort of a product or a
33:23 feature called
33:24 amplitude recommend where you can
33:26 actually do this um
33:28 using amplitude where you can send the
33:30 data from amplitude
33:32 into your back to your product and of
33:34 course to other tools
33:36 to create like a unified uh customer
33:39 experience
33:40 yeah so uh maybe we can take a step back
33:43 you
33:44 like there was a lot of information and
33:45 they have so many questions
33:47 um but starting even from the the
33:49 beginning so
33:50 you said for tracking plan uh for
33:53 creating this tracking plan we can use
33:54 uh
33:55 dimensional tool i think called uh track
33:57 plan right
33:58 and there are some other things then um
34:01 then okay we have this tracking plan
34:03 then a developer an engineer would go
34:05 and implement this uh
34:07 do data collection um i know other
34:09 specific tools
34:11 for that uh for collecting data
34:14 uh so typically like of course there are
34:17 there are sort of cdi tools uh
34:19 you know customer infrastructure tools
34:20 customer infrastructure tools that
34:22 uh so the ones i mentioned uh track plan
34:25 is one but uh
34:26 rvo and iteratively sort of they these
34:28 are tools that
34:29 that allow you to also collect your data
34:31 and not just create the track to plan
34:33 but other popular tools will be segment
34:35 connections so
34:36 segment connection is one of the most
34:38 popular tools people use
34:39 to track product data um there's also
34:42 rudder stack uh there's another one
34:44 called
34:44 meta router which is a relatively new um
34:48 there whole bunch of tools there's one
34:49 called fresh paint which
34:51 which uh which enables implicit tracking
34:54 so you don't even have to define
34:55 tracking
34:56 that's just like auto track once you
34:58 install it starts tracking all the
34:59 events automatically
35:01 like heap does and then of course
35:03 companies
35:04 companies do this using code and you
35:06 know some companies build a microservice
35:08 just for the tracking purposes um but
35:10 then of course there are all these great
35:12 tools that i mentioned
35:13 um in fact i have i have i have uh i
35:16 have written about this that
35:17 happy dish i have to share uh content
35:20 please send the link and i'll include it
35:23 in the description
35:24 uh yeah okay sure so and then we
35:27 mentioned that we
35:28 the data should be that the data we
35:31 collect we can send
35:32 immediately to uh product analytics tool
35:35 but it's better to store it in every
35:37 house so what is a very house
35:39 i think it's uh essentially like a
35:41 database that you
35:42 own right so it's not like a third party
35:44 too
35:45 but yeah maybe you can tell in uh
35:48 you know tell us what is it's it is is
35:52 it
35:52 any database or it's some sort of
35:54 special database
35:56 yeah so a warehouse is generally a
35:58 database that is
35:59 purpose built for analytics right so
36:01 it's not like a
36:02 like a typical database um and companies
36:06 use it to store
36:07 uh large amounts of structured data um
36:10 and then
36:10 they obviously uh create data models in
36:13 the data warehouse so
36:14 they transform the data they clean the
36:16 data there of course other tools
36:18 just for transformation purposes tools
36:20 like dbt trifecta etc which you know
36:22 you're well aware of
36:24 um and once you have this clean
36:26 structured data
36:27 in the warehouse you can basically
36:29 analyze this data in a bi tool
36:31 it's also worth mentioning that uh there
36:33 are
36:34 product analytics companies that are now
36:36 sort of warehouse-centric
36:38 uh so if you if you have a warehouse and
36:40 you if you already if you're already
36:41 sending data to your warehouse and you
36:43 want to
36:43 implement a product analytics tool you
36:45 don't have to use their sdks to to sort
36:47 of
36:48 send data to them directly you can send
36:50 data from your warehouse
36:51 uh to these products there's also a tool
36:54 called rockcom which
36:56 doesn't even you don't even need to send
36:58 data to it it just sits on top of your
37:00 warehouse like a bi tool
37:01 and offers data analytics features so um
37:05 it's really important to set up a
37:06 warehouse and uh popular warehouses
37:08 worth mentioning are obviously snowflake
37:10 uh will big query aws redshift there's
37:12 some new ones called uh
37:14 firebolt is a newer data warehouse in
37:16 fact we have someone from firewall in
37:18 our community
37:19 um and then i think i saw recently
37:23 also in data talks club right yeah
37:26 exactly that's what i mean yeah that's
37:28 what i meant and then
37:29 a bunch of other of course uh warehouse
37:31 uh vendors there's one called
37:33 span apply uh so once you have the data
37:36 in the warehouse you can actually
37:37 do a lot of things with it um and you
37:39 can actually send it back
37:41 to your uh not just bi tool but also
37:43 part and
37:44 analytics tools and then um you can even
37:47 send it to your engagement tools
37:49 uh and they're again a new bunch of uh
37:51 companies that have come up
37:53 that are just solving this problem uh
37:54 they're sort of referred to as
37:57 a reverse etl tools or or operational
37:59 analytics tools companies like
38:01 census high touch group they are they're
38:04 basically solving this exact problem
38:06 that
38:06 you have the data in the warehouse and
38:08 you want to basically send data
38:10 to a lot of different tools your sales
38:12 marketing
38:13 advertising support tools or whatever
38:15 product analytics tools you can do that
38:17 um
38:18 using this this third party too so yeah
38:21 a lot of different tools solving
38:23 different
38:24 pieces of the puzzle uh of course like
38:26 to implement all of these different
38:27 tools you'd
38:28 uh need like a lot of resources you'd
38:30 need a data team
38:32 um at least a couple of or maybe at
38:34 least one dedicated data engineer
38:36 so it's not possible for early stage
38:38 startups to do everything
38:40 um and that's where it's also worth
38:43 mentioning
38:44 cdp's customer data platforms which are
38:47 sort of they're like an all-in-one
38:49 bundled solution
38:50 where you can track data and then you
38:52 can send data to different tools
38:54 um so you can like you can create
38:56 audiences and create your
38:57 models and segments inside a cdp of
39:00 course
39:01 it has limited capabilities you can't
39:03 exactly do everything you can do in a
39:04 warehouse
39:05 but it still gives a lot of flexibility
39:07 to marketers and growth
39:09 professionals to to you know work with
39:11 data without relying on
39:13 on data teams so yeah
39:16 i was trying to take a note of all the
39:20 tools you mentioned but there are simply
39:21 so many
39:23 and i'm wondering so let's say i just
39:25 started the startup
39:27 i and my co-founder so i haven't started
39:30 the startup i'm just like a hypothetical
39:31 hypothetical yeah
39:32 yes so i have a co-founder so there are
39:35 two of us we just started the startup
39:37 and to understand that data is important
39:40 we want to collect and we look at all
39:42 these tools and
39:43 there are just too many like how do we
39:45 make a decision which tool to choose
39:47 like
39:48 uh i think it's not about are they
39:51 different
39:51 similar yeah how to choose yeah i think
39:54 i think it's first important to define
39:56 what your
39:56 goals are uh and a good way to think
39:59 about this is to like just
40:00 list down uh you know 10 questions that
40:02 you want to answer with data
40:04 and then work backwards and and figure
40:06 out the tools uh
40:08 of course there are ready-made tools but
40:09 a lot of companies end up
40:11 uh you know fixing these problems or
40:14 implementing these solutions without uh
40:16 buying ready-made tools by building in
40:18 our schools so
40:19 it depends uh you know what your
40:20 resources are because
40:22 these tools can also get expensive but
40:24 uh at the very least you need
40:26 you need to start collecting data so you
40:29 need uh tool
40:30 like a cdi to like segment connections
40:32 broader stack
40:33 uh meta router uh i'll share this whole
40:36 list
40:37 which actually written a lot about this
40:38 stuff so shares list
40:40 um and once you have the data you
40:42 obviously want to analyze it so
40:44 and of course it's worth mentioning that
40:46 a lot of these tools do have
40:48 free tiers free plans so you know you
40:50 can explore different tools and see what
40:52 works for you
40:53 um but at the very least you want to
40:55 analyze this data
40:57 in a product analytics tool um or even
41:00 like a single bi tool
41:01 um or both actually makes sense to you
41:04 know have both depending on um
41:06 because they both sort of serve
41:08 different purposes and you know give it
41:09 to different teams
41:10 um and then of course you you want to
41:14 uh have like an email tool where you
41:16 send this data to
41:17 create personalized emails do on great
41:20 onboarding experiences
41:21 um if you have a sas product you want to
41:23 do some in-app onboarding
41:25 so you know there are tools for that and
41:27 you can send this data to those tools
41:28 so there are these four or five
41:30 different tools so
41:32 i like to mention this so i like to
41:33 think of this data stack
41:36 as the modern data stack for growth so
41:38 uh typically
41:40 if you hear the term modern data stack
41:41 uh you generally
41:43 hear it in the context of uh analytics
41:45 um
41:46 modern data stack for analytics is like
41:49 how i would
41:50 describe it where you have uh you have
41:52 an elt tool like five friends stage etc
41:55 where ingesting data from all third
41:57 party tools into a warehouse
41:59 uh and then you have a bi tool and you
42:00 have a transformation tool
42:02 um so that's typically a modern data
42:04 step for analytics
42:05 um and dbt is worth mentioning here um
42:09 you know it's
42:10 growing so fast and you know so many
42:11 companies are adopting liberty
42:13 for their transformation needs and
42:15 modeling needs and then bi tools like
42:17 liquid looker mode
42:19 etc so so that's like the modern data
42:21 stack for analytics
42:23 um in terms of modern data stack for
42:25 growth i would say
42:26 you need a data collection tool a
42:28 product analytics tool
42:30 um and then a warehouse is is one more
42:33 stable states like every company should
42:35 have it
42:35 um and then of course uh tools that are
42:38 that makes
42:39 make data available in your downstream
42:42 sas tools you know sales marketing
42:44 support tools um and that could be a
42:46 custom data platform
42:48 it could be uh if you're using tools
42:50 like segment connections and or radar
42:52 stack
42:53 they can do that they have that
42:54 capability or
42:56 if you have if you're storing the data
42:58 in the warehouse then you can use a
42:59 reverse etl tool
43:01 um and each of these categories has
43:03 obviously multiple tools so
43:05 you know like a lot of them are very
43:07 similar
43:08 you know some have different
43:09 capabilities so it is sort of time
43:11 consuming to
43:12 evaluate all of these different tools
43:14 and um you know understand
43:16 the differences and that's actually one
43:18 of the things i'm trying to solve uh
43:20 with data led academy i'm still
43:22 launching this thing called company
43:23 profiles where
43:24 you know you can go and learn about a
43:27 product
43:28 um in a very simple manner understand uh
43:31 what the product does what the core
43:33 benefits are and
43:34 uh who the product caters to and then
43:36 get you know answers
43:37 to questions about the product so um
43:40 yeah i agree like companies spend a lot
43:42 of time uh figuring
43:44 out the right tools and that is a
43:46 problem that that needs to be solved
43:49 and uh myself i'm i have this
43:52 engineering background
43:54 often i look at these tools and think
43:56 okay why they are so expensive i could
43:58 implement something like this
43:59 uh and then of course like i know that
44:02 once implement there will be bugs and
44:04 then it's difficult to maintain later
44:07 uh yeah it's probably i don't know if
44:11 you
44:12 if you had this in your experience you
44:14 go to a company
44:16 you say okay this is a great tool and an
44:18 engineer say no no
44:19 like it's i'm going to implement it
44:21 myself
44:22 so do you i've experienced that a lot
44:25 yeah so
44:27 yeah i would like to say that like like
44:29 one of the things that
44:30 that's really important to sort of think
44:32 about is that very few people actually
44:34 like using these tools you know
44:36 for most people it's a headache it's an
44:38 additional sort of task
44:39 whether for engineers to implement the
44:41 tool or for other business teams to go
44:43 and use these tools
44:45 uh at the end of the day everyone just
44:47 wants answers to questions
44:49 uh especially when it comes to data uh
44:51 or they just want data to be available
44:53 in the right format so that they can use
44:55 it um and derive insights from it or act
44:57 upon it so
44:58 um yeah like
45:01 implementing new tools is not easy at
45:03 all especially when it comes to data
45:05 tools uh
45:06 there's a lot of like security uh
45:08 challenges
45:09 uh a lot of compliances issues
45:11 compliance issues so
45:12 um it is difficult so it's like and
45:15 that's why it's really
45:16 important to understand the problem that
45:18 the tool solves
45:19 um and then you know if you have the
45:21 resources then you can do
45:23 like a buyers build analysis you know if
45:25 you build this
45:26 sort of in-house then uh how much
45:29 you know it will cost us and whatever
45:31 resources we need to maintain that
45:33 versus
45:33 uh buying a ready-made solution or of
45:35 course open source
45:37 like it's worth mentioning again that a
45:39 lot of these tools uh
45:40 are open source uh so radish tag is open
45:44 source uh grouper with a reverse utl
45:46 tool is open source
45:48 a bunch of open source bi tools um
45:51 there's a with an open source uh product
45:53 analytics tool
45:54 now called post hog so in every category
45:57 you'll find open source tools
45:58 um if you have again the resources of
46:01 course uh
46:02 it takes a lot of effort to implement an
46:04 open source tool just because open
46:05 source doesn't mean
46:06 it's like easy to implement but uh if
46:09 you have the resources you can obviously
46:10 you know go that route
46:13 okay and um what
46:16 kind of roles we need to um so we
46:19 discussed about tools we discussed uh
46:21 about the flow
46:22 so the flow from the moment we start
46:24 capturing later to the moment
46:26 uh i think you'll call it data
46:28 activation so to the moment when data is
46:30 activated
46:32 yeah um and i heard that
46:35 we need at least to have a data like an
46:38 engineer somebody who implements this
46:40 so who else do we need to have in a team
46:43 to
46:44 implement the whole flow from the
46:45 beginning to the end
46:47 yeah i would say like um typically you
46:50 know for early
46:51 startups you may not have a dedicated
46:52 data engineer so
46:54 uh you know different like any engineer
46:56 a backend engineer could could help you
46:58 with that stuff
46:59 uh or even a front-end engineer could
47:01 help you with a bunch of that stuff
47:02 uh but eventually you'd need a data
47:05 engineer to manage all of these
47:06 different
47:07 data pipelines and you know it's not
47:08 just about implementing the tool once
47:10 right you
47:11 you have to um maintain it you have to
47:13 make sure that you know
47:14 everything is working properly and then
47:16 of course teams have have continuous
47:18 requests for new
47:19 new new events to track you know you
47:21 want to add more data you want to
47:22 collect more data so
47:24 um yeah at the very least you need uh a
47:27 data engineer
47:28 and then um if you if you have uh
47:31 if you're using a bi tool and you're if
47:33 you're implementing a warehouse
47:34 then it makes sense to have a data
47:36 analyst who will be
47:38 you know analyzing the data and like you
47:39 know making the data uh
47:41 available in the bi tools so uh at the
47:44 very least you need those two i've seen
47:46 companies hire
47:47 uh you know one data person who does
47:49 pretty much
47:50 all of this stuff and now now like
47:53 there's obviously analytics engineering
47:55 which is a more specialized role
47:58 uh which sort of fits in between data
48:01 engineering and data
48:03 data analysis and they they specifically
48:06 work on
48:07 on tools like dbt and they you know
48:09 build data models
48:10 um so again depending on the resources
48:13 you eventually need
48:14 you know all of these people um there
48:17 are companies that are hiring data ops
48:19 people who
48:20 who basically just you know make sure uh
48:22 that all of these different tools are
48:24 working
48:25 um you know all of these different teams
48:27 have access to
48:28 to the tools that they need and uh to
48:30 the resources that they need
48:31 um there are companies that are creating
48:34 product ops teams
48:35 so companies that don't have sort of
48:37 dedicated data teams they're calling
48:39 uh the stream called product ops and
48:42 prototypes
48:43 often does a lot of the work that data
48:46 teams do
48:46 so you know they take care of all the
48:49 tools they take care of your
48:50 etl pipelines they take care of your
48:52 warehouse
48:53 again you have an analyst an engineer um
48:56 and
48:56 and someone who understands the product
48:58 really well um
49:00 so yeah it depends on like it doesn't
49:02 matter what you call it but
49:04 uh depending on your resources you sort
49:06 of decide how many people you'd want
49:08 um in a team like that um it definitely
49:12 makes sense to
49:13 you know empower product teams and
49:15 growth teams to to understand all of the
49:17 stuff so then
49:18 they can sort of support these teams uh
49:20 or like
49:21 you know they can support these teams by
49:23 by uh
49:24 taking up a lot of their work and and
49:26 not like adding
49:27 more work for these for data people so
49:30 one of the
49:30 typical challenges is that data people
49:33 are overwhelmed with requests
49:34 you know from different teams where
49:36 different teams have requests to
49:38 track new data or you know like commit
49:40 data available different tools
49:42 or create dashboards uh if you enable
49:45 um different teams to do a lot of that
49:47 work themselves
49:49 um then then obviously you can make your
49:51 data people
49:52 more efficient and that's what there's a
49:54 whole sort of
49:55 conversation around data democratization
49:58 where you're you're not just making data
50:01 accessible
50:02 for people but you're enabling them to
50:04 to sort of
50:05 uh work with data and like um
50:08 you're implementing self-serve analytics
50:11 tools that you know people can go in
50:13 and like uh derive in science from data
50:15 themselves
50:16 um you're investing in in upskilling
50:18 people
50:19 uh maybe um having people learn some
50:22 basic sql
50:23 so that they can run very simple queries
50:26 um
50:27 you know so that they don't have to rely
50:29 on on their on on
50:31 data people to create like for every
50:33 query that they
50:34 that they want to run or at least yeah
50:36 they can like take a sequel query and
50:38 put it in the right place and run it and
50:40 then
50:40 understand it so um again like these
50:44 things are
50:44 becoming more and more common and it
50:46 just makes sense for
50:48 like pretty much every sort of team to
50:51 to learn these skills and become data
50:53 literate
50:54 and i strongly believe that one doesn't
50:57 need to have
50:58 like an engineering background or even a
51:00 technical
51:01 any sort of technical background to work
51:04 with data
51:06 so yeah quite a few uh quite a few roles
51:09 we need to have uh but
51:10 i i also like uh because not every
51:14 company needs all
51:15 uh these people so for a smaller uh for
51:19 just earlier stage startup uh maybe they
51:21 just need somebody like
51:23 an analytics engineer maybe who can do
51:25 both analytics and
51:26 uh some data engineering right and then
51:29 as a team grow
51:30 like maybe you can have uh they can have
51:33 a data engineer then maybe a data ops
51:35 team who can support
51:37 all these tools and then he also talked
51:40 about data democratization
51:42 and as i understood you so this is
51:46 uh this is about enabling
51:50 people in the company like analysts and
51:53 others
51:54 uh who need access to the data to
51:56 actually go and access the data
51:58 themselves go and
51:59 analyze data themselves go and implement
52:01 some things on top of data
52:03 themselves right is there any more to
52:05 that like what is it
52:07 yeah i think uh data literacy is a big
52:09 part of it uh you cannot
52:11 just democratize data just by making
52:13 data available
52:14 or just by giving people access to two
52:16 different tools
52:17 um so you know investing in indiana
52:20 literacy
52:21 uh having people understand uh from from
52:24 like less technical teams or business
52:25 teams
52:26 you know uh how data works making
52:28 investing in documentation maybe
52:30 investing in
52:31 in a data cataloging uh tools or data
52:33 documentation tools whatever you want to
52:35 call it the tools like
52:36 atlan cicoda a bunch of others that are
52:39 working on this
52:40 sort of solving this problem um so
52:43 making data available
52:44 investing on on on data literacy within
52:47 an organization
52:48 and then making data available in the
52:50 right tools um
52:52 where people can actually use their data
52:55 and not just look at dashboards um and
52:57 then of course like upskilling them
53:00 so that they can like uh efficiently use
53:03 product analytics tools to
53:04 to you know self-serve their their
53:07 analytics needs
53:08 or even uh like i said learn some sql to
53:11 go and you know use a bi tool
53:13 um so yeah i think i think it's it's
53:15 about
53:16 uh to sum it up i would say is investing
53:18 in data literacy
53:19 and making data available making clean
53:22 accurate data available
53:25 in the different tools across an
53:27 organization um
53:28 yeah and uh also documented right
53:32 available and
53:33 yeah yeah i mean if you don't document
53:35 it especially in a remote world like uh
53:38 it's crazy it's one of the most
53:40 important things people need to
53:42 companies need to think about and it's
53:45 one thing that
53:45 very few people like to do yeah about
53:48 that
53:49 uh how to actually motivate people to
53:52 write data documentation because i i
53:54 know it's difficult
53:56 like as a data scientist i am uh
54:00 the one who constantly produced new data
54:02 for others to consume
54:04 but this step of documenting this data
54:07 is somewhat annoying
54:08 so how do you convince people like me
54:10 and others
54:11 to actually go and recommend this data
54:14 yeah i think
54:15 it it works when you start small uh and
54:18 you
54:18 start early like the the earlier that
54:21 you start the easier it is
54:22 going to be if you if you keep sort of
54:24 delaying it it becomes difficult
54:26 uh and then again like i strongly
54:28 believe that if there's a tool that can
54:30 solve your problem you should
54:32 uh explore that tool and adopt that too
54:34 so uh
54:35 tools like atlan which are sort of these
54:37 new new age data
54:39 documentation data discovery tools they
54:41 are they're they basically integrate
54:43 with all your different data sources
54:44 with your verizon
54:45 bi tools with different tools and they
54:48 they actually automate a lot of the
54:49 documentation process
54:51 and indian exploration so uh if you have
54:54 a lot of different data sources and you
54:56 you have a lot of you know
54:58 you have a lot of data in different
54:59 places and you don't have a
55:02 like a way to efficiently document it
55:04 then that's worth exploring
55:06 these tools but obviously like before
55:08 you invest in a
55:09 in a data documentation cataloguing tool
55:12 you need to have
55:13 the right data infrastructure in place
55:15 it obviously comes
55:16 after you know once you have data
55:18 collection warehousing um
55:20 analysis activation all of that you know
55:22 in place that's when
55:23 you invest in these tools so i think if
55:26 you're starting today then
55:28 it should be like table stakes that
55:30 everything that is being tracked should
55:31 be documented
55:32 um and you know everywhere that has been
55:35 used should be documented
55:37 and uh you know like that that's that's
55:39 how you'd go
55:40 about it if you don't start early then
55:42 and it's just gonna be a mess later on
55:45 okay so it's more about the culture and
55:47 mindset right so you just
55:49 you just say okay we need it uh we start
55:52 early and for all the data we produce
55:54 we must have documentation because if we
55:56 don't then it becomes
55:57 nice right yeah yeah it's really
56:00 important to start early i think and
56:02 like you mentioned it's definitely a
56:03 culture thing
56:04 you know um so yeah thanks for
56:06 mentioning that
56:08 one thing i actually wanted to ask you
56:10 at the very beginning but uh
56:12 we didn't uh cover this so there is a
56:15 thing also called
56:16 product led right and yeah i wanted to
56:19 ask you
56:19 what is product that and what is the
56:22 difference between
56:23 uh being a product that being a data lab
56:27 yeah yeah great question i think uh
56:30 being
56:30 being product led requires you to be
56:32 derailed
56:33 uh because the whole idea of being
56:35 product is
56:36 is enabling your product to drive growth
56:39 or using your product to drive growth
56:41 rather than
56:42 investing in sales although you know of
56:45 course the
56:46 product led and sales can definitely
56:48 coexist
56:49 but um one of the principles of product
56:52 led is
56:52 that you know users or prospects or
56:55 customers can should be able to try your
56:57 product before they
56:59 buy the product right so um you want to
57:02 have have like a free trial or a free
57:05 plan um
57:06 and then people should be able to use
57:07 the product and derive
57:09 value from it before they they're asked
57:12 to buy it before a sales person
57:13 and this takes us back to the earlier
57:16 conversation where i mentioned that
57:17 you know once the salesperson sees that
57:20 uh prospect
57:21 uh has actually you know used the
57:22 product and derived some value
57:24 or reached aha moment of the product i
57:26 often be referred to as do it as
57:28 uh the activation event where again in a
57:31 project management tool it could be
57:33 creating a project and adding uh one
57:35 user and creating three tasks you know
57:37 and
57:37 that's when you feel like you know the
57:39 user has derived some value from the
57:40 product
57:41 um so that is being product led like
57:44 uh and typically product that applies to
57:46 organizations not not individuals so
57:49 typically your product like company
57:50 where you invest in these uh sort of
57:52 product
57:53 uh efforts in a product like motion uh
57:56 and a self-serve on boarding experience
57:58 and
57:59 to create the cells of one body
58:01 experience you need data if you don't
58:02 have data then you're not able to
58:04 sort of enable prospects to have that
58:07 personalized experience when they're
58:09 starting
58:09 to use your product a common example is
58:12 uh you know
58:13 uh in in-app walk-throughs or onboarding
58:16 walk-throughs
58:16 that you typically see when you start
58:18 using a new product
58:20 you can actually personalize it
58:22 personalize it a lot uh based on
58:24 you know the the role of the user or the
58:26 industry of the user
58:28 and then keep personalizing it based on
58:30 the features they're using the product
58:32 um but only if you are data led if you
58:34 have the data and you're
58:36 using data to build those onboarding
58:39 experiences or triggering emails emails
58:41 is a great example
58:42 um a lot of companies you might have
58:44 received an email from a company saying
58:46 that hey
58:47 uh you should try using this feature uh
58:50 after you've already used that feature
58:52 that's very common right uh and and
58:54 that's that's like you know
58:56 it's it's very it's a very bad
58:57 experience because you
58:59 you've actually opened that email um and
59:01 someone who's created that campaign
59:04 they'll be very happy because you know
59:05 they see a good open rate
59:07 but actually it's it's annoyed you
59:09 because you're like this their emails
59:10 are useless
59:11 next day i'm not going to open their
59:12 emails because they're telling me to do
59:14 things i've already done
59:15 right but if you had data if you need a
59:17 lead you
59:18 not do that you make sure that if
59:20 someone has used a feature
59:21 they will not be asked to use that
59:23 feature again
59:26 so if i can try if i can attempt to
59:28 summarize what you said
59:30 so being a product let it first of all
59:32 applies to the company not
59:33 to an individual it's about
59:37 taking feedback from users and
59:40 then being led by this feedback being
59:43 led by what users want
59:45 and to be able to do this you cannot
59:47 call every user and ask hey
59:49 like what should we do right so you need
59:51 to actually track the data you need to
59:52 have this data to make a
59:55 uh yeah if i may say data driven
59:59 decision right
1:00:00 uh yeah like it just didn't like baked
1:00:03 by data like
1:00:04 data informed yes yes decisions
1:00:08 and feedback is definitely an important
1:00:10 part of it like you know gathering
1:00:11 feedback
1:00:12 while people are using the product uh
1:00:14 you know running micro surveys in the
1:00:16 product
1:00:16 or even uh gathering like uh quality of
1:00:20 data by looking at
1:00:21 heat maps and session recordings like
1:00:23 all of that stuff sort of
1:00:24 drives towards a product led approach
1:00:28 okay thank you so we should be wrapping
1:00:30 up and they wanted to ask you if you
