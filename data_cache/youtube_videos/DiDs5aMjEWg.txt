0:01 okay hello everyone so
0:03 thanks for joining us on our last day of
0:06 week one
0:06 of data talk summer marathon so this
0:09 week we talked about career data
0:11 and we already had four amazing talks so
0:14 on monday we talked about transitioning
0:16 from software engineering to
0:18 machine learning then we talked about
0:19 getting promotion
0:21 then andreas told us about building data
0:23 pipelines and roxawanna told us
0:25 yesterday
0:25 about the difference between data big
0:28 data engineers and data scientists
0:30 and today we have our last talk for this
0:33 week
0:34 and then i will talk about building
0:36 engineering startup
0:38 and please check the week two so i know
0:41 not many of you

1:56 yeah are you ready totally
1:59 okay so and i am
2:02 almost ready as well
2:12 okay so let's start so today we'll talk
2:15 about building machine learning startups
2:17 and we have a special guest today elena
2:19 elena is a ceo
2:20 and co-founder at evidently ai which is
2:23 a startup
2:25 that develops open source tools for
2:27 machine learning model monitoring
2:29 she has been in machine learning since
2:31 2014
2:32 and evidently is not your first startup
2:35 before evidently
2:37 elena co-founded an industrial area
2:39 startup so and then has a lot of
2:41 experience with startups
2:42 and it's not the first time we speak to
2:44 elena actually so elena is a returning
2:47 star
2:48 and in february she gave a presentation
2:51 about how your machine learning project
2:53 will fail
2:54 which is a great talk and i recommend it
2:56 to everyone and check it it's in our
2:58 youtube channel
2:59 before this week it was the most popular
3:03 uh talk on our channel uh now it's
3:05 second uh because
3:07 of santiago uh santiago stock on monday
3:10 but this is a great talk and uh yeah i
3:13 do recommend checking it
3:16 so thanks for joining us again for the
3:18 second time
3:19 thanks i'm super glad to join before we
3:22 go into our main topic
3:24 of building machine learning startups um
3:26 let's talk a bit about your background
3:28 can you tell us about your career
3:31 journey so far
3:32 so in short it has been either about
3:35 startups or about machine learning on
3:37 both
3:37 pretty much for the last nine years uh
3:40 originally i started in the startup
3:42 scene in berlin when i joined startup
3:44 that was doing some
3:45 e-commerce search aggregation and that's
3:46 how i was first introduced actually to
3:48 both topics because they also were using
3:49 some machine learning
3:51 pretty basic things back then but still
3:54 then i joined yandex which is a large
3:55 search engine in russia and
3:57 i was running startup accelerator there
3:59 that is one of the things that i'm still
4:00 super proud of because it's very
4:02 rewarding experience like helping other
4:03 people to launch their companies and
4:06 you just meet so many people who are
4:08 like active and doing things it's
4:10 actually very very
4:10 inspiring so i got inspired too and i
4:13 joined an internal startup with yandex
4:14 which was called the andes data factory
4:17 the idea was that because yandex did so
4:19 many machine learning internally we can
4:20 apply it elsewhere so we were working
4:22 with different industries and i was
4:23 doing business development mainly
4:25 then i left to co-found this startup
4:26 where we worked with manufacturing so
4:28 companies like steel making and aluminum
4:30 production olympus
4:31 helping them apply machine learning i
4:33 was holding product role and
4:35 basically as a founder doing many other
4:37 things because that's what you do when
4:39 you
4:39 do a startup and right now we're
4:40 building a new startup related to
4:43 this open source model monitoring so you
4:45 can check it out and try it out
4:46 it's completely free and open source
4:48 which is probably another topic to
4:49 discuss while you do that
4:51 but that said i want to also give a
4:53 disclaimer that like if you try to start
4:55 a startup you'll get a lot of advice
4:56 listed or not and also please take
4:58 everything i say with a grain of salt
5:00 because no one is an expert in your
5:01 business but
5:02 still you can learn from some others
5:03 mistakes and thoughts so just
5:05 adjust to the experience when you listen
5:08 to someone
5:09 so including this podcast including this
5:12 podcast
5:14 don't take it at fast failure okay
5:19 so do you know why people start their
5:21 own business
5:22 so what what motivates them why um
5:25 why not working just for a company well
5:28 you know i think it really depends for
5:29 different countries different
5:30 circumstances it's also important to
5:32 distinguish between starting a business
5:34 for example or you can open a restaurant
5:36 or you can teach a course
5:37 something that is has a known business
5:39 model or going into startups where you
5:41 launch like some tech
5:42 company and try to solve some something
5:44 completely new it's a very different
5:46 part because when you talk about
5:47 traditional business
5:48 it is often for example for immigrants
5:50 it would be like kind of
5:51 like survival strategy right you come to
5:54 your country
5:55 you start the business because the only
5:56 way for you to build up wealth
5:58 some people want to get rich i would
6:00 actually advise against that if you want
6:02 to get rich there are maybe other
6:03 schemes than just like building a
6:04 startup
6:05 some people want to solve uh generally
6:07 solve a problem they see some people
6:09 just enjoy doing things from scratch and
6:10 that's probably me because uh
6:12 i'm one of those people who like to
6:13 start up things from the very beginning
6:16 can be inside a company can be elsewhere
6:17 but it's all about you know just like
6:19 doing something from scratch
6:22 so getting rich is not about startups
6:25 well you can't succeed but the chances
6:27 are pretty low so there are like more
6:28 guaranteed pots i would say working for
6:30 a big tech is probably much more
6:32 yeah i think i've read an article
6:34 somewhere that
6:36 if you take the expected uh expected
6:39 value
6:40 like basically how much on average you
6:42 would earn
6:43 working in a big tech company versus
6:46 creating a startup then startup will
6:49 give you smaller expected uh data
6:52 so it's sort of the same but many people
6:54 enjoy the journey so
6:55 that's why yeah yeah i can imagine that
7:01 when you make a startup you said uh like
7:03 in your previous startup
7:05 and i guess in your current one you take
7:07 product role
7:09 which meant you ended up doing many many
7:11 different things
7:12 well it's not just the product it's
7:13 basically everything that you need to
7:15 get yourself to the next
7:16 level right and in different stages in
7:18 the company that might mean different
7:20 things
7:22 yeah so let's say yeah i am motivated to
7:26 start a startup
7:27 i know some machine learning so i want
7:29 to build the machine learning stuff now
7:31 where can i get ideas for that well
7:34 first of all
7:34 don't like don't start a machine
7:36 learning startup what i mean by that
7:38 is that when you frame it like this you
7:40 actually kind of like decide on the
7:41 solution so you know the technology
7:43 you're going to use
7:44 instead of looking for a best way to
7:45 solve a problem so here's a trick right
7:47 so you might know some machine learning
7:48 but ideally if you can avoid this don't
7:50 try to build a machine learning style
7:52 try to find
7:53 a problem that you can genuinely solve
7:55 just like a random example say like you
7:57 want to help
7:58 grocery stores to get rid of out of
8:00 stock situations and you think like
8:02 i'm going to build like better
8:03 forecasting models for them but then
8:05 when you come and talk to them you might
8:06 learn that it's not the forecasting
8:08 there is the problem but they for
8:09 example don't even have the data about
8:11 what's there in the store
8:12 so the solution for them would be to
8:13 actually build some sort of data
8:15 collection
8:15 through an app maybe through something
8:17 else and if you
8:19 solve this probably you don't even need
8:20 machine learning you can create the
8:22 value as this
8:23 and if you come with an idea no i only
8:25 want to do the modeling
8:26 you might pass on this opportunity right
8:29 so it's better if you come with an open
8:30 mind
8:31 if you can that side i know many people
8:32 who kind of settle in the technology and
8:34 become this uh
8:35 hummer in search of a nail problem and
8:37 some succeed so but
8:38 probably if you can try it out with this
8:41 yeah okay so if all i want to do is do
8:45 machine learning so then maybe startup
8:46 is not the best uh
8:48 way of doing this that is kaggle and
8:50 other websites right
8:51 yeah and the thing is i think in general
8:54 like if you come to a startup your role
8:55 will change so much so you should not
8:56 come with an idea of like
8:58 hey i want to do this and this is the
8:59 only thing i know you can do like this
9:01 if you're an employee in the company
9:03 with a predefined role right and
9:04 understand what's there in the market
9:05 with a startup you'll be constantly
9:07 doing
9:07 very different things well there i think
9:09 there are some ways how you can search
9:11 for ideas which might be
9:12 related to machine learning or not one
9:15 would be actually to look at your own
9:16 problems or better problems of your
9:18 company because
9:19 when you are inside some business you
9:20 can absorb some things and
9:21 inefficiencies
9:22 and come up with the idea like hey let's
9:25 test it is it big enough of a problem my
9:27 people actually
9:28 like experiencing pain do they want to
9:30 pay to solve it and like these sort of
9:32 things
9:32 specifically for machine learning i
9:34 would definitely advise to try to team
9:36 up with someone with domain expertise in
9:38 an area that you're interested in
9:39 so it can be like you know people would
9:41 into insurance or into finance or into
9:43 healthcare
9:44 because i think like the best way how
9:46 right now you can create value with
9:47 machine learning is applied to like
9:49 other vertical domains
9:50 but for that you typically would need
9:52 someone who can explain you the things
9:53 because you don't want to be reinventing
9:54 the wheels and coming like with
9:56 algorithms and like
9:57 making things that are obvious like
9:59 coming up hey like you can do this this
10:01 great stuff
10:02 and i would also suggest maybe to fall
10:04 out of startups because if you don't
10:05 yet understand like what is the uh what
10:08 is the startup like what is values in
10:10 the market what can become a company i
10:11 think just like developing this kind of
10:13 sense of what's going on by following
10:15 other like investment news what type of
10:17 companies have been started
10:18 it can give you this feeling but don't
10:20 try to search for an original idea i
10:22 think this is a sort of a
10:23 kind of like caveat that many people
10:25 fall into it's like a trap you say like
10:27 hey
10:27 someone else is already doing this no i
10:28 should come up with something that will
10:30 be absolutely non-existent before
10:32 but most typically these are things that
10:34 are not really needed because you just
10:35 like you know try to come up with a
10:37 shiny thing that no one ever
10:39 gonna use so basically to come up with
10:42 idea
10:42 the best way is to first of all you can
10:45 try to find some problems
10:47 in your own life and see if there's
10:50 something easy that you can
10:51 do to fix it or you team up with
10:53 somebody
10:55 somebody let's say who is coming from
10:56 insurance or from some other domain
11:00 and they can tell you about the problems
11:02 they have and then together you can
11:03 think about the solution to these
11:05 problems right so you need
11:07 a non-technical co-founder who is a
11:09 domain expert in some
11:11 particular area i would not say it's
11:13 necessarily so right it's just like one
11:15 ways how you can
11:16 find better problems than by searching
11:18 it yourself and ideally if this person
11:20 like is as involved as
11:21 they should be they should become a
11:23 co-founder but you can also start a
11:25 startup
11:25 with like people you know and you don't
11:28 have
11:28 to be business people actually i think a
11:30 lot of companies are started by the
11:32 technical founders if you're ready to
11:33 learn and pick up some things and
11:35 do some sales probably that is not
11:37 comfortable for many technical
11:39 people but not necessarily so right you
11:41 can you can still learn all this
11:43 yeah let's uh talk a bit about this uh
11:46 finding the
11:47 echo thunder so let's say i'm a
11:50 technical person
11:51 so i know some snowing i know how to
11:53 code i am not
11:55 good at all the sales i don't enjoy
11:57 selling things
11:58 so i want to find somebody who is uh who
12:01 might enjoy doing these things and also
12:03 the main expert in some
12:04 area so how do i go
12:08 about doing this so who who
12:11 who do i need like to start with and how
12:15 do i find these people
12:16 yeah i think there is no silver bullet
12:18 it's always like you know how do i find
12:19 like my best friends or
12:21 because it it's really like there is no
12:23 predefined recipe
12:24 one thing i can say that i think it's
12:26 ideally you should have worked with this
12:28 person before
12:28 because teams that have just met it's
12:30 very difficult to maybe check like how
12:32 compatible you are
12:33 and being co-founders is a lot more than
12:36 just being colleagues because when your
12:37 colleagues you can maybe
12:38 be okay with more things you don't have
12:40 like to agree on about everything on the
12:43 you know like values level but when it
12:45 comes to being co-founders like if
12:47 you're successful you're gonna be
12:48 together for five ten years
12:50 working like a day and night so you
12:52 should really like click with this
12:53 person and understand and
12:54 it's very like personal right so they're
12:56 like just like people who can
12:58 work together successfully and people
13:00 who don't and you should really check
13:02 for this kind of personal compatibility
13:04 and also motivation because sometimes
13:05 people say like hey i'm gonna like
13:07 join you with a starter but only like if
13:09 you pay me this money or
13:11 only if it's successful in the first
13:12 year but startup is really
13:14 a hard journey so you should check like
13:15 the expectations of
13:17 each other but how exactly to find these
13:20 people
13:21 i think we're looking at your past
13:22 colleagues and people that you've worked
13:24 with maybe as partners maybe as clients
13:26 maybe you started at school with is
13:28 usually the better way
13:29 but i've also heard how people like just
13:30 sometimes meet each other like a heck of
13:32 a talents or
13:33 events but usually they still work
13:35 together a bit right maybe not on
13:36 startup but on some projects on some
13:38 events
13:39 so you get a feeling of how well you
13:40 communicate with person and
13:43 in general like how well you get along
13:45 so maybe you can build together a
13:47 hackathon project
13:48 and then you see how well you get along
13:50 maybe yeah but hackathon is a bit of an
13:52 artificial right thing it's like maybe
13:53 one day you don't i think ideally you
13:56 should have
13:56 gone at least one uh situation when you
13:59 had some
14:00 adversaries like some something's going
14:02 on something went wrong right
14:03 like a conflict conflict right or just a
14:05 difficult situation just don't know and
14:07 understand how you deal with that not
14:08 just like in a fun project when no one
14:09 really
14:10 cares what's going on yeah right i also
14:13 heard about this
14:15 especially in berlin there are things uh
14:17 meetups like that
14:18 i think they are called co-founder
14:19 dating methods
14:21 what do you think about these events i
14:23 think it can work
14:24 just like you expand your network right
14:26 naturally this is another way to expand
14:28 your network with the people who are
14:29 active and interested i think like
14:30 joining different communities is a great
14:32 way to
14:33 to meet people but it just often happens
14:35 organically that you like first work on
14:37 something else right but
14:38 where you meet it with school and
14:40 community the conference
14:42 anything can happen but i think you said
14:45 uh best uh is uh
14:48 if you work with somebody you know these
14:50 people are progressing because you
14:52 already know how to work with them
14:54 work as in like work on something not
14:55 necessarily placed in the same company
14:59 but one thing i can like maybe add to
15:00 this is that i think there is a
15:02 such a thing that's called like founder
15:03 market fit when you
15:05 understand that you are the right
15:07 founders to tackle a specific problem
15:09 and this is something that you should
15:11 consider
15:12 in mind so just one example sometimes
15:14 like there are companies that are going
15:15 after enterprise market
15:17 which is very sales heavy so you go and
15:19 you
15:20 try to sell a very expensive thing and
15:22 sign a very like a long contract
15:24 this is like their sales is one of the
15:26 core capabilities
15:27 then there are startups where you can be
15:29 doing a tool for developers
15:31 and your main capabilities actually
15:32 being able to understand these
15:34 developers communicating their language
15:35 and so on
15:36 and there might be you know equally
15:38 great ideas and equally great market
15:39 opportunities but you as a
15:41 founder team might be better suited to
15:43 tackle this for that idea
15:44 and this is sometimes that people don't
15:46 take into account
15:48 but i would definitely recommend to a
15:50 check for this and also choose your
15:51 market
15:52 because again if you're successful
15:54 you're going to be in this market
15:55 following the strengths talking to these
15:57 people for years to come
15:59 even if the inside technology might look
16:01 like similar you know you do machine
16:02 learning but say in my past start that
16:04 we were working with manufacturing so i
16:05 was talking to
16:06 heads of manufacturing companies and now
16:09 we are working with a
16:10 data scientist it's a very very
16:12 different market into how you
16:13 communicate to that
16:14 so you should be comfortable with the
16:17 with what you choose
16:18 how do i choose how do i know if i like
16:20 manufacturing if i haven't worked well
16:22 ideally you shouldn't go into market
16:24 that you don't know about
16:26 or we probably should have a co-founder
16:28 who has experience yes
16:29 exactly i'll find someone who can help
16:30 you get that
16:32 okay um yeah so
16:36 what are the things that i should
16:38 consider so let's say
16:40 there is an idea there is a co-founder
16:44 and we seem to like each other to go
16:46 well to go along
16:47 to go along well with each other just to
16:50 try
16:51 to say at least to try to do something
16:53 yes so yeah so
16:56 what things that which which things we
16:58 should consider
16:59 to like before we actually started
17:04 well i suggest that you should agree at
17:06 least on a few things between you and it
17:08 really makes sense to
17:09 you know like really spell it out
17:10 because sometimes people expect
17:12 different things but
17:13 you don't understand it until you start
17:15 talking so one is
17:17 actually be honest on yourself like why
17:19 you are doing and how
17:20 long are you in this game because i've
17:23 heard about this multiple times
17:24 in general like compounder breakup is
17:26 probably one of the most popular things
17:28 why
17:28 early stage startups fail is like when
17:30 people really have different
17:31 expectations they think like well i'm
17:32 gonna be here for a year or two and then
17:34 i go
17:34 to work for google right another person
17:36 says like hey i'm gonna
17:38 really like put everything into this
17:39 startup like work days and nights and
17:42 you should be honest in this
17:43 communication why you are doing what are
17:44 you doing how committed you are and it's
17:46 better to know these things early on
17:47 right so that you have very different
17:49 views on
17:49 what's going on then i think you should
17:52 really
17:52 decide what type of company you built
17:55 and here if you are new to this startup
17:57 thing
17:57 very important thing to understand is
17:59 that startups are very special breed of
18:01 companies if you want to raise venture
18:03 capital
18:04 you should build a fundable venture
18:06 startup
18:07 something that attracts uh something
18:09 that goes after a really big market
18:11 something can become this unicorn
18:13 one billion valuation right something
18:15 that can grow really fast and at the
18:16 same time it doesn't necessarily
18:18 should be profitable in the early days
18:20 it can bring you money later on
18:22 but the core idea is that you're going
18:23 to build this company that grows really
18:25 fast and that has a chance of this
18:26 shot of becoming something really really
18:28 big at the same time you can also for
18:30 example just build a
18:31 service company where you create uh
18:33 projects after each clients uh
18:36 whatever they want like custom projects
18:38 you build them you get revenue you get
18:40 profits
18:41 you can get these profits and spend on
18:43 your own things
18:44 this is not the venture way right so you
18:45 cannot like raise venture capital with
18:47 that
18:48 and sometimes people just don't uh
18:51 figure these things
18:52 early days in the early days right
18:54 especially if you are not accustomed to
18:56 the venture capital like many things
18:57 they are
18:57 really counter-intuitive so like not
18:59 having profits profit is a bad thing
19:01 it means that you are not spending money
19:02 on growth right so you should really
19:04 understand and learn a little bit about
19:05 this and decide if that's for you
19:07 because
19:08 this is a very special thing right
19:09 you'll have to go raise money talk to
19:11 investors
19:11 beat yourself maybe it's nothing maybe
19:13 all you want is to have a
19:15 relatively small growing business where
19:16 you take it it's okay right you just
19:18 need to
19:19 really understand that how do i
19:21 understand that so i just
19:23 like is there any rule of thumb well
19:27 you just should really think about this
19:28 venture capital startups understand the
19:31 the benefits and the the problems and
19:33 then just like do you want to try it or
19:34 not if you don't probably you're going
19:36 after more classic business right then
19:37 you should just
19:39 maybe you can even take a loan you can
19:41 invest it you can build it up
19:43 that's a great thing and actually you
19:44 can be better off financially by doing
19:46 this business
19:47 compared to a failed startup that tried
19:49 to to go to the moon and did not succeed
19:51 okay so it's about how ambitious you are
19:54 if you're very ambitious if you want to
19:55 conquer the world
19:57 then you go to venture capitals if you
19:59 just want to have one client and start
20:01 developing a solution for them
20:03 silently then maybe you just uh
20:06 bootstrap you just well bootstrap can
20:09 still be done for
20:10 a venture capital startup in the early
20:12 days we'll start with more about like
20:13 not raising capital in the beginning and
20:15 trying to maybe like reinvest the money
20:17 that you get if you get some clients or
20:19 just like lift up your savings
20:20 or do some consulting on the side it's
20:22 just the way how you basically leave to
20:24 a point where you're going to raise
20:25 money
20:25 sometimes you want to do this because
20:27 you want to delay it or maybe you want
20:28 to actually keep optionality because
20:30 once you get investor money you're
20:31 getting this
20:32 train and you have to continue raising
20:34 money and growing and if you don't
20:36 you're not yet decided maybe you can
20:38 like keep both options open
20:40 so the caveat here if investors
20:43 give you money your startup no longer
20:44 belongs to you only right so now there
20:47 is
20:48 there's money of the investors at stake
20:51 and you basically uh need to sometimes
20:54 do what they
20:55 tell you right well they don't in the
20:56 early days they still cannot tell you
20:58 exactly what to do but
20:59 it's like an expectation how this is
21:00 gonna happen later stages they're
21:02 probably gonna have more than half of
21:03 your company
21:04 but in general the idea is that these
21:05 investors they put money into
21:08 companies that have this moonshot
21:09 potential with expectation that they're
21:11 gonna get like 10x return at least right
21:13 and they put money in multiple companies
21:15 and they know that like nine out of ten
21:17 will fail they want to find the one that
21:18 will not
21:19 so you have to continue trying to give
21:22 them this shot and like
21:23 growing as fast as you can so pouring
21:25 money into that stuff it's a very
21:26 peculiar thing and it's
21:28 really not intuitive if you don't see
21:30 how this happens
21:34 anything else we should consider before
21:36 starting
21:37 particularly for the machine learning
21:39 startups i think you have this choice of
21:40 whether you want to do the vertical
21:41 startup like i mentioned when you're
21:43 solving some specific need of some
21:44 specific market
21:45 or actually if you want to build tools
21:47 and infrastructure which for technical
21:49 people is often like the
21:50 first thing they think about hey i want
21:52 to build this library i want to solve
21:53 this tool better
21:54 so like there is this choice of going
21:56 vertical
21:57 or going after uh the infrastructure
22:00 market which is getting really crowded
22:02 we are
22:02 both in this community so you see like
22:04 how many startups are popping
22:06 up every day so if
22:09 you think about envelope space right so
22:11 there are
22:12 many companies that are trying to solve
22:16 machine learning operations problem and
22:18 yeah it does feel crowded
22:20 sometimes okay so this would be an
22:22 example if we take
22:23 one of these companies that would be an
22:25 example of a
22:26 two startup right it's a company that
22:29 develops a two
22:30 four engineers while in another case uh
22:33 you
22:33 i think you said particular solutions
22:35 just i can give you this
22:36 one specific example there is this
22:38 company tractable that's i think based
22:40 in the uk and recently
22:41 recently became unicorn what they do
22:43 they help you uh evaluate
22:45 uh the the damages uh for insurance
22:49 based on images so for example like you
22:51 broke a car you take a picture and the
22:53 machine learning-based algorithm
22:54 automatically judges
22:56 how much the insurance should pay you so
22:58 this is an example of vertical startup
22:59 that solves somewhat
23:00 boring problem related to insurance and
23:02 how you estimate the damages right
23:04 this is a vertical thing where probably
23:06 you need someone who understands how
23:07 insurances work
23:10 i heard this term called ai first
23:12 startup
23:15 what does it mean it's about the same
23:17 pretty much like ai that
23:19 machine learning it should be at the
23:20 core of technology but the thing is that
23:22 sometimes people kind of misuse it
23:24 because it's just a cool thing to say so
23:26 even if you have like a bit of a linear
23:27 regression in your
23:29 startup in one feature right you can say
23:32 like hey where yeah
23:33 first so you should really look what
23:35 what comes first
23:36 okay so it's a way to attract more money
23:39 from investors because investors
23:41 want to invest into ai right well i
23:43 think good investors they look into the
23:45 reality but it's also like about like
23:47 the hook for the media
23:48 because like media maybe like writing
23:50 more when it sounds cool
23:51 and ea first also sometimes for the
23:53 buyers because like uh some companies
23:55 they would be interested to buy
23:56 something noble and innovative and
23:58 when you say you're a first you're
23:59 probably more noble than others
24:02 but there is also another angle to that
24:04 is that many stars of this type
24:05 start from the machine learning part
24:07 they eventually will grow into much more
24:08 than just machine learning algorithms
24:10 for some like system that was there
24:11 initially
24:12 so you will start solving more and more
24:14 adjustment problems you will start
24:16 collecting the data you will actually
24:17 add the interface and all the workflows
24:19 you become like a
24:20 more of analytical startup that does
24:22 many things ei included
24:24 so do you still be called ea first but
24:27 at that point i don't know so it's a
24:29 just a kind of marketing choice whether
24:30 you decide to do that
24:32 and speaking of tools like the other
24:36 direction i heard this expression from
24:39 somebody
24:41 that building tools for engineers is not
24:44 always the best idea because engineers
24:47 they don't like
24:49 uh engineers like building things
24:50 themselves so they don't always
24:53 like going and buying they'd rather
24:57 build something themselves
24:59 and if you build something for engineers
25:01 so how do you even overcome this is it
25:03 something you also need to think about
25:06 you should think about this whichever
25:08 market you choose so like how you're
25:09 going to sell to your buyers and
25:10 if there is any like purchasing intent
25:12 but still like you can say hey
25:14 you shouldn't do developer tools but
25:15 then look at all these companies that
25:17 are doing like
25:17 stuff like data dock and a new relic
25:20 which are doing money it's a great
25:21 example
25:21 right and people are paying for this and
25:23 databases then
25:24 github and gitlab right so they're doing
25:26 tools for developers everyone
25:28 is using them like jenkins acd tools so
25:30 there's a hopefully for
25:31 things that people are still paying for
25:33 right uh ides
25:35 yeah so actually datadock is a good
25:37 example because this was the context
25:39 when i heard this so i was talking to
25:41 uh to a couple of people about datadog
25:43 specifically and one person said that
25:46 these engineers they like open source
25:49 like they would rather have primitives
25:51 grafana everything their own
25:52 infrastructure
25:53 rather than just playing uh some
25:55 external company like data talk for
25:57 collecting the metrics
25:58 so it's uh like a tricky market oh data
26:01 dock
26:02 there is success for everyone on this
26:03 market no they still exist
26:05 there's space for both right so both
26:07 exist and are growing yes and
26:08 data talk is doing pretty well right
26:10 yeah and graffana too and graffan is
26:12 actually even though it's open source
26:13 it's actually it will
26:14 generate money because i have graffana
26:16 enterprise
26:18 so someone is still paying for it so
26:20 what kind of skills do i need
26:22 to start the startup well you know i
26:25 think to be a self-starter and want to
26:27 start a startup and everything else can
26:29 be learned
26:30 so like you should be just comfortable
26:32 with like learning
26:33 things constantly and like being
26:36 comfortable with uncertainty and a lot
26:38 of rejections and
26:39 in general you know like be more of an
26:41 optimistic side i think because like if
26:42 you just like risk averse you want to
26:43 have everything like uh
26:45 sure and like guaranteed but probably
26:47 startups is not for you but
26:49 skill wise i think everything can be
26:50 learned because there's like no perfect
26:52 well-rounded startup founder that knows
26:54 everything
26:55 if you're ready to learn and put some
26:57 time on it anyone can come
26:59 so self-starter is somebody who starts
27:02 themselves but what does it mean well i
27:05 just mean that like you are ready to
27:06 take responsibility
27:07 initiate things and motivate yourself to
27:09 do that you know don't wait for someone
27:11 to tell you to explain how to do things
27:13 you're doing it your own you're like
27:15 making hypothesis you're finding the
27:17 right people you're talking to them
27:19 like you're just like doing things uh
27:21 with internal motivation as opposed to
27:23 like waiting for someone to explain to
27:24 you what to do so you just
27:27 count on your own intuition that uh the
27:29 thing you're doing is
27:30 the right one right well i think you
27:32 don't need to always in account on your
27:34 intuition but you can just say like hey
27:36 i have this idea so now let me check how
27:38 i can
27:39 verify it right so i'm going to do this
27:40 i'm going to do that i'm going to talk
27:42 to these people i'm going to talk to the
27:43 financial customers
27:44 but you decide on your own like what to
27:46 do you come up with this
27:48 hypothesis how to to check for it right
27:50 how to
27:52 okay so let's say if i work at a company
27:55 and they like when my manager gives me a
27:57 well specified tasks
27:59 so then i just take these tasks and do
28:02 them
28:03 then maybe a startup is not the best
28:06 thing for me right or maybe not yet i
28:08 think that
28:09 people are not necessarily you know
28:11 static at some point
28:13 you might feel differently
28:17 and to what are the risks
28:20 i think we discussed a bit that maybe
28:23 just working at a big tech company when
28:27 it comes to money
28:28 expected uh expected value like how much
28:31 money you would learn like at the big
28:33 tech is better
28:35 so what are the risks of building your
28:37 own startup
28:38 so you probably need to live on uh your
28:41 own saving for some time
28:42 and there is no guarantee that this
28:45 money will go back
28:46 are there some other risks well actually
28:49 i think not necessarily you have to live
28:50 on your money because there are some
28:52 ways some people start you know
28:53 alongside
28:54 their day job and then at some point
28:55 when they're ready they like kind of
28:56 roll over and they try to raise capital
28:58 but in general like financial risks are
29:00 huge just because uh
29:02 you're most likely gonna lose money like
29:03 it's almost guaranteed even if you like
29:05 later on gonna pick it up so it's uh
29:07 it's not the best financial decision in
29:09 most cases and in general you what you
29:11 highly likely to fail right so it's a
29:13 it's almost guaranteed statistically
29:14 that you're going to fail as a startup
29:16 so you should prepare for it and
29:18 i think interesting part here is also
29:20 cultural acceptance because depending on
29:21 where you are in the world people can
29:22 treat this failure very differently so
29:24 for example if you're in the u.s like
29:26 having a field startup is like
29:27 something to celebrate i mean a little
29:30 bit
29:31 like over overstating it but it's
29:33 perceived as okay right so
29:35 it's learning opportunity for you in
29:36 other places in the world it can be seen
29:38 as like
29:39 something damaging your future career if
29:41 later you try to go and continue
29:43 your professional career so something
29:44 like this should be considered
29:47 work-life balance can be tough so if i i
29:49 must say that doing startups is often a
29:51 bit of a luxury so not everyone can
29:53 afford this
29:54 in terms of you know like their uh
29:56 personal commitments and ability to take
29:58 risks so it's not always possible in
30:00 many places in the world
30:01 you might have family to take care of so
30:03 you cannot risk financially of
30:05 doing a startup but yeah so there are
30:08 these things related to
30:09 failure and i would not mention any you
30:11 know like career
30:13 prospects or like losing your knowledge
30:15 because i think like you learn so much
30:16 that
30:17 you can later find maybe new career
30:19 opportunities for you if you decide to
30:20 go back to
30:22 interesting that's one of the things uh
30:24 i will this
30:25 always think about if you let's say i am
30:28 an engineer
30:28 i'm a data scientist and i start a
30:31 startup
30:32 then most likely i will end up doing
30:35 other things in addition to that or
30:37 maybe i will stop doing data science at
30:39 all and
30:39 focus on other things so one way could
30:42 be that
30:43 in five years i will forget how to train
30:45 logistic regression
30:46 or something like this and you're saying
30:47 it's totally fine because the skills
30:50 i would pick while building a startup
30:53 they would
30:53 allow me to change it here right well i
30:56 think that
30:57 maybe for the technical skills at least
30:59 they might become some a bit rusty right
31:01 unless you
31:01 really invest time to support president
31:03 but then you also have like more
31:05 new career plots opening up to you uh
31:07 maybe it will be more of a managerial
31:09 role or maybe it can be like a
31:11 more product role because like now after
31:13 you have tried to build your own startup
31:15 you
31:15 look at the things you know not like
31:16 just like from a little technical detail
31:18 how implemented but you actually look
31:20 from the big picture like what are you
31:21 doing
31:22 for whom why it is needed and it's
31:24 actually like the sense of ownership and
31:25 understanding the big picture it's very
31:27 valuable
31:27 and especially to join to work in other
31:30 startups maybe the one that is a bit
31:31 more successful than yours have been if
31:33 you're like uh
31:34 left you started to lead some division
31:37 to grow past because
31:38 i know many founders were like
31:40 struggling to hire people with a startup
31:42 mindset
31:42 and usually someone who tried it is the
31:44 best candidate for
31:46 this sort of hire and
31:49 uh yes you mentioned that when starting
31:52 startup we should be prepared
31:54 to fail how to be prepared to fail like
31:58 is it this
31:58 uh maybe you just like you know this
32:02 i think in buddhism you just
32:05 see think already failed and then if it
32:08 fails you don't worry about this or
32:10 how do you go about this well i don't
32:12 know about the specific
32:14 mental techniques but i think rather you
32:15 should understand that this opportunity
32:17 exists and kind of normalize it for you
32:19 so you shouldn't like associate yourself
32:21 with your startup and like saying like
32:22 hey this star
32:23 fails like i'm like wasted and like i
32:25 don't know like my left hands
32:26 so this is like a very dangerous thing
32:28 and like you shouldn't understand like
32:29 hey this is the thing that i'm trying
32:30 but i know that it might not work and
32:32 even if it does not work these are the
32:33 things that i'm going to learn and
32:34 that's how you're going to help me
32:35 of course you stay optimistic because
32:37 why else you're doing this
32:39 but i think just like normalizing it
32:40 it's very important so that it doesn't
32:42 come off as a
32:43 huge shock if this happens but hopefully
32:45 it doesn't
32:46 and other thing you mentioned that
32:49 work-life balance suffers
32:50 when you do a startup is it possible to
32:53 make a successful startup while working
32:55 let's say 40 hours per week i don't know
32:58 of any examples
33:00 maybe there are like maybe it's me who
33:02 is bad at it and maybe the people that i
33:03 meet are
33:04 not so good at it either but i think
33:05 like also when you're passionate about
33:07 something it doesn't feel always as work
33:09 right so like
33:11 sometimes like uh with microphone or
33:13 even jokes like there's like a weekend
33:14 work that is like
33:16 the work you like to do so you choose to
33:18 do it on your weekend
33:19 because you enjoy doing it but yes it's
33:21 still like you're doing something for
33:22 yourself
33:24 okay so you said you haven't seen an
33:26 example i
33:27 i personally first hand don't know the
33:29 people who are like
33:30 living a very relaxed uh work life
33:33 balance and doing a startup maybe like a
33:34 little
33:35 from those who have businesses like more
33:37 traditional businesses i know a lot
33:39 maybe those who are at later stages when
33:40 the company is a little bit more mature
33:42 they already like
33:43 figure things out but if i look at
33:44 everyone who is at the early stage who i
33:46 personally know maybe these are just the
33:47 people in my circle
33:48 it's always erring on the side of
33:50 overworking a little bit but i think
33:52 by choice you also know you know
33:55 every incremental hour gonna bring you
33:57 like really you know the value of it
33:59 right
33:59 you know it's not like in a big company
34:01 but nothing will happen even if you
34:02 don't touch something for a month
34:06 yeah we already started getting
34:08 questions and uh
34:10 you already mentioned that when you
34:12 start a startup you don't necessarily
34:13 have to put stuff
34:15 uh meaning leave on uh your savings
34:18 you can do a startup while
34:21 still working so like part-time startup
34:24 so what do you think about this is it a
34:27 good approach because you need to
34:29 work 40 hours and then you have this
34:32 part-time startup that eats the the rest
34:35 of your week
34:36 okay is it a good idea to do that well i
34:39 think it's always very individual right
34:40 it's also might be that for example at
34:42 your workplace you
34:43 really have like more calm things are
34:45 more calm and like sorted out if you're
34:47 like in high growth startup yourself
34:48 probably you can't do this
34:50 in general of course it's better if you
34:51 can dedicate yourself full time but it's
34:53 not always feasible and especially if
34:55 you're a technical person you're mostly
34:57 likely the one who can create this
34:58 meaningful viable product meaning write
35:00 the code yourself right and then test
35:01 the demand
35:02 so this is something that you can do or
35:04 try to do it can be a weekend project
35:06 or there are surprising examples of
35:08 startups that it's not like the
35:10 code part like actually like it's not
35:12 like a huge you know
35:13 complex system it's more about uh
35:15 figuring out the demands and what is
35:17 needed
35:18 and then building maybe a small thing
35:19 that solves this demand and then you can
35:21 see like a huge
35:22 list of people who sign up for it and
35:23 say hey looks like something maybe i
35:25 should go and talk to investors and
35:27 try to raise money for it
35:30 i think actually in germany you have
35:31 some really nice ways to support like
35:34 younger startups especially those out of
35:35 universities so there are some programs
35:37 where you can apply and you will get
35:38 some money
35:39 like as a grant for free so it's
35:42 not taking equity so there are also some
35:43 opportunities like this especially in
35:45 europe too
35:47 yeah but there are also start-ups
35:48 startup accelerators that do take
35:50 a part of your company well they're
35:51 usually already investors so you often
35:53 need to show something to get into these
35:55 accelerators but yeah this is like an
35:57 early investor it can also be like an
35:59 investor yeah that i know a couple of
36:01 people from such startup accelerators so
36:04 i think
36:04 the accelerator the company gives them
36:07 some sort of stipend
36:08 like some sort of money monthly loans so
36:11 they do not have to start to death
36:13 while doing a startup so they pay them
36:15 some money while they're
36:17 looking for an idea looking for
36:19 co-founders but then i think they take
36:21 like 30
36:22 of the company i think this is not a
36:24 classical model the classic model will
36:26 be like uh to just
36:28 act as an early investor to take like
36:30 equity or like have other ways how they
36:32 take a portion of your company
36:33 and then you just like you can spend
36:35 this money however you like as a startup
36:36 right but you need to
36:37 pass a certain bar to get there but then
36:40 there are these other like new
36:41 newer ways i think it's like
36:42 entrepreneur first also like a science
36:44 layer it's like some other
36:45 uh like organization like this that
36:47 actually try to invite individual people
36:49 and then form teams inside but yes they
36:51 usually take a bit more inequity
36:53 i think all this is possible because in
36:55 the end when you have a successful
36:56 startup everything just happened in the
36:57 early days it's not that important
36:59 most of startup makes mistakes like do
37:01 something wrong with their equity and so
37:03 on
37:03 it's more about like whether it's like
37:05 one percent of a billion or one percent
37:07 of
37:08 well nothing okay so maybe it's not a
37:11 bad thing if this startup accelerator
37:13 opens
37:14 thirty percent of uh thursday is a big
37:16 fight to be honest
37:17 because it can't uh i think it's a
37:19 number yeah i think i think it's less
37:21 but yeah
37:22 just often startups accelerator would
37:24 take like five to maybe seven percent
37:26 which is like more reasonable but yeah i
37:28 was actually talking about this
37:29 entrepreneur first i just forgot the
37:31 name and uh
37:32 they did reach out to me also a couple
37:34 of times saying so
37:35 this is how they work so they just write
37:38 on linkedin to different people saying
37:40 hey you seem to have uh
37:42 great skills and like your technical
37:45 expertise
37:47 will be beneficials or join us
37:50 then these are the conditions then
37:52 probably some people
37:53 agree and go build a startup well i
37:56 think entrepreneur first is
37:57 definitely a good example just because
37:59 they continue to exist right and it's
38:00 also they don't do it for free because
38:02 they eventually make money because this
38:04 some of the companies become successful
38:05 so it should work
38:08 so we talked about uh like
38:11 if i'm a technical person and they want
38:13 to start a startup this is what i do
38:15 what if i'm not super technical so and
38:18 they don't have any resources to develop
38:20 something
38:21 what uh probably building a machine
38:23 learning startup gonna be hard but
38:24 building other startups is still
38:26 possible because now there are so many
38:27 like no-code tools and you can actually
38:29 hack an mvp
38:30 like using something like an air table
38:32 and bubble and there are like
38:34 workflow and all these ways how you can
38:36 like create a website some simple apps
38:38 like some simple mobile app to test some
38:39 idea and then
38:40 if you see a demand for it you can
38:42 already attract the technical profound
38:43 or even investments without doing that
38:45 but it doesn't work for all types of
38:48 startups but obviously for example if
38:49 you want to build and
38:51 buy a tech startup you also probably
38:52 should not go there without biotech
38:54 expertise so your options are
38:56 a little bit limited but they still
38:58 exist and there are
38:59 startups especially in sas like software
39:01 as a service that and
39:02 technical is not the most like it's not
39:05 like some
39:05 specific engine inside that makes it
39:07 differentiate from others right it's
39:09 more the idea
39:10 maybe you automate like accounting for
39:12 some companies and what you do in the
39:14 first days you are the one who is doing
39:15 the accounting for them right through
39:17 the same interview that you later want
39:18 to automate
39:19 you just want to prove that it can work
39:22 and people
39:22 are ready to pay for it i've heard this
39:25 term
39:27 is productionizing your services i think
39:29 this is what you're referring to
39:30 or productizing like making your
39:32 services a product
39:34 uh that uh you can do accounting so then
39:37 you start
39:39 doing accounting for clients and then
39:42 you start wrapping up in a nice
39:43 interface
39:44 and then you let your customers clients
39:47 actually use this interface and then
39:49 maybe at the beginning you do the
39:50 accounting
39:51 yourself behind the hood under the hood
39:54 but then you can automate it
39:56 right if it can be fully automated yeah
39:58 that's an awesome style the challenge is
40:00 that sometimes it cannot so you still
40:01 have this very custom thing and then
40:03 it's very difficult to scale
40:04 because you still need someone who
40:06 understands accounting to deal with each
40:07 individual client's issues
40:10 unless you really standardize something
40:13 okay
40:14 and another question we have is i have
40:17 found
40:18 a problem in my domain and i have
40:20 learned statistical modeling and machine
40:22 learning
40:24 do uh do i need to find uh
40:28 like a tech expert or a domain expert to
40:31 help me
40:33 it depends i i don't know the details uh
40:36 about the exact thing but
40:37 i would suggest that if you already have
40:39 someone who is ready to
40:40 uh work with you just like try and go
40:43 and learn from this first customer right
40:44 so
40:45 i think action is like you should always
40:47 like
40:48 favor action when you're doing a startup
40:49 because you're going to learn from it
40:51 and uh you will learn something new when
40:53 talking to the client and send for
40:54 example what exactly is needed very
40:56 often
40:56 startups pivot it's like you change your
40:59 idea or it devolves it's almost like
41:01 normal that it evolves and if you look
41:03 at many successful startups it started
41:04 as something completely else
41:06 so i would not overthink it i would not
41:08 over plan stuff i would always just try
41:10 to go and talk to these potential users
41:11 and learn something from that
41:13 and if you cannot get to these users
41:14 easily probably that's not your startup
41:16 because you would need to continue like
41:19 generating ways how to reach to them
41:22 yeah so basically you said favor action
41:25 and you favor action over inaction over
41:27 overthinking what we're thinking can you
41:29 kind of like a plan like you know a
41:31 super amazing strategy and it will be
41:33 then fulfilled it's not for starters
41:35 talk to people hear what they say try to
41:38 do this
41:38 so you just sometimes just need just do
41:41 it
41:42 right just okay you found the problem so
41:45 if you found the problem then there is
41:46 somebody who has this problem right
41:50 go to to that person and talk to them
41:52 just just do the talking not don't do
41:54 the coding you know without talking to
41:56 people
41:56 don't don't misunderstand me in this way
41:58 because this is
42:00 open a thing especially with technical
42:02 founders is that you want to do this
42:03 perfect startup and spend a lot of time
42:05 like
42:05 doing the perfect code without talking
42:07 to your users and
42:09 that sounds awesome right doing a very
42:10 shiny thing but you might be doing the
42:12 wrong thing so you should
42:14 yeah so how many people should i talk to
42:16 before starting
42:18 coding well i i think like until you
42:20 stop hearing
42:21 new stuff so like you should try to find
42:23 people who are like similar in some way
42:25 so you can say like hey this is
42:26 this these roles in this industry that
42:29 might be my potential buyers i don't
42:31 like accountants right
42:32 so i'm going to talk to like i don't
42:33 know five accountants like asking them
42:35 about their questions and problems and
42:36 if you still keep hearing like new
42:38 things so each of them is
42:39 saying different things probably should
42:40 continue talking if you talk to maybe 10
42:42 and you understand that six of them were
42:44 saying exactly the same thing you said
42:46 that's probably reasonable
42:49 i think there is an article from
42:50 atlassian or some other company that
42:53 you don't need many people you don't
42:55 need to interview many people
42:57 if you interview like three or five and
42:58 all of them have the same problem then
43:00 you're to something you know i think the
43:02 problem is how you define that people
43:04 are the same because like
43:05 they might come like you know for
43:06 companies from different sizes so they
43:08 might have like a little bit different
43:09 roles so
43:10 some parts of a problem is actually
43:11 figured out so are you talking to data
43:13 scientists machine learning engineers
43:14 data science managers and small
43:16 companies and big companies in
43:18 tech companies and non-tech companies in
43:20 specific industries these all the
43:21 sub segments which might have different
43:23 needs if we talk about for example data
43:25 science world
43:26 how many people did you talk to before
43:28 starting evidently
43:29 well we did really overboard so i think
43:32 we talked in total
43:33 before starting to work with our
43:35 productivity
43:36 and more than hundreds during the early
43:39 days of development
43:41 so you met your co-founder uh even
43:44 before talking to these people right
43:46 well we know each other with emily for
43:48 more than seven years so we worked
43:49 together in yandex and then we did
43:51 together the second
43:52 previous startup so we are a team that
43:54 knows each other
43:55 for long so your previous startup was
43:57 also with emily
43:58 yes okay yeah so yeah i'm just
44:02 interested to to hear the story like how
44:05 did you
44:05 so you work together and then at some
44:08 point you decided to
44:09 make a startup so how did it happen well
44:12 talking about evidently so after working
44:14 like with so many applications that we
44:16 created for different companies and most
44:18 recently in manufacturing
44:20 world we saw that there are a lot of
44:22 problems that are not related to the
44:23 core technology but rather to its
44:25 adoption and also
44:26 what happens after you put models in
44:28 production so i know like if you are
44:30 hanging out with these communities it
44:31 sounds like trivial that many people are
44:33 already solving it but for example
44:34 beginning of last year it was not that
44:36 obvious for many
44:38 and if you talk to more traditional
44:39 companies you would also learn that they
44:40 actually
44:41 have the same problems about like how
44:43 you monitor your models how you
44:45 understand what's going on with them
44:46 other cannot and we thought from our
44:48 past experience that it's an interesting
44:50 idea we actually had several different
44:51 ideas and we went to talk to people to
44:53 validate it and
44:54 monitoring was the one that we saw like
44:56 a lot of response
44:57 about and people were like quoting us
44:59 like how the models broke and they
45:01 didn't notice and
45:02 how it's like annoying no one wants to
45:04 do this the data's trying to sleep the
45:05 project
45:06 and when it's soaring doesn't happen the
45:08 models are left like um
45:10 unknown like uncontrolled and so we
45:12 heard this and it's like hey this
45:14 we validated this idea out of sound that
45:16 we have that's to work on this and
45:18 we went on to build evidently and i'm
45:20 super happy how we're going and
45:22 we have a great team so this is a
45:24 important part of working together i am
45:26 relationship
45:26 here so just two of us two of you right
45:29 yes and one more person who is
45:31 part-time okay
45:34 so how did you go about okay you talked
45:37 to these
45:38 50 people and to actually started
45:42 starting doing this uh startup so what
45:44 did you do after this well
45:46 you know it's like always happening so
45:48 like you talk to a few people you like
45:50 process the feedback in the process
45:52 while we were talking to them we already
45:53 like made some mock-ups for example and
45:55 we like tried to show like hey this is
45:56 what you expect like would you like to
45:58 look at this or that so it
46:00 it kind of happens over over the process
46:02 i must say like
46:03 when we begin we're working evidently it
46:05 was like the beginning of a lockdown so
46:06 the world
46:07 felt a bit crazy but at the same time it
46:08 was very easy to talk to everyone on
46:10 zoom because everyone was like sitting
46:11 home and
46:13 we we're just like talking a lot to
46:14 people and switching to coding and in
46:16 our case it's
46:17 because like we are complementary in our
46:19 skill set for example i was focusing on
46:21 initiating contacts with these people
46:23 like following up inviting
46:25 people to chat and emily was doing the
46:27 prototyping at first and then the actual
46:28 coding
46:29 when we proceeded to development so what
46:32 do you do evidently
46:34 i think you're everything technical
46:36 you're the non-technical company yeah
46:37 i'm the doctor
46:38 well you have to ask who is our designer
46:40 like i'm our designer for our blogs too
46:42 so it really evolves over like the part
46:45 the moments in your company right so
46:47 when we were just starting up it was for
46:48 example like talking to users and trying
46:50 to process the
46:51 feedback like organize it so i'll come
46:53 up with ideas
46:54 then when we started working i now look
46:56 do a lot of content
46:58 so basically i'm like writing all these
47:00 blogs that help us
47:01 like also talk to our users and generate
47:04 interest in what we are doing
47:06 and talking to investors and financial
47:08 investors and
47:09 building up all the part beyond the code
47:12 pretty much like how you set up the
47:13 company where you incorporate how you
47:15 organize all this
47:16 so it's like co is not a title as in
47:19 like a certain role that you do right
47:20 it's like chief everything officer which
47:22 is not
47:23 code in in our specific example but i
47:26 must say it really depends on
47:27 what startup you are doing so your all
47:29 can be different and
47:30 it's if you're for example if you were
47:32 focused on direct enterprise sales i
47:34 would be doing the sales and this is
47:35 what i did in my past started
47:37 now we are doing more evangelizing and
47:39 talking to users about open source tool
47:41 because it's free to use so
47:42 we are more interested in people trying
47:44 it out and giving feedback fast and
47:45 that's what i'm trying to do
47:47 most of my days so talking to people
47:51 then writing content and
47:53 you also a designer to some extent right
47:57 that's part of writing content but it is
47:59 a joke right that you have to do
48:01 whatever is needed and
48:02 what you can right so in our case we can
48:04 create this high quality
48:06 content so we focus on this could have
48:08 been something else
48:10 okay and we have a question from
48:12 anonymous and i also have this question
48:15 why do you choose the open source model
48:17 for evidently
48:19 well it's actually a very successful go
48:21 to market strategy for many
48:22 infrastructure startups these days so
48:24 it's it can be
48:25 also just a rational choice if you do
48:27 infrastructure and you can see like it's
48:29 companies like grafana they
48:30 actually monetize their open source
48:32 business
48:33 but they create a lot more value by
48:35 creating this open source tool and
48:36 for us it's also just resonated a lot
48:38 because it seems a very natural and good
48:40 thing to do when you create
48:42 a lot of uh value for these users
48:45 but then you basically monetize only
48:47 some parts of them which would be like
48:48 large enterprises that are
48:50 ready to pay for what you do and another
48:52 aspect of that is that you actually get
48:53 very fast iterations and feedback loop
48:56 so for example if you just create a
48:58 uh like you know like a huge like
49:00 monolithic uh like close source thing
49:02 you first need to create it and deploy
49:04 it on some customer and then see like if
49:06 they like it or not and with open source
49:08 you can release like small features it
49:09 can be
49:10 not yet fully functional but people are
49:12 already trying it and they saying
49:13 something to you so it actually helps
49:14 you to
49:15 iterate a lot faster so it's a very i
49:18 think nice way to build up your product
49:19 in public
49:20 and a good go to market strategy for
49:23 later on because
49:23 open source doesn't mean that you don't
49:25 make money out of it it's just a
49:27 different strategy
49:29 because one concern i hear uh from some
49:32 people
49:33 saying they they say why would i open
49:36 source my code
49:37 because people would just go and copy my
49:40 code and
49:41 deploy it so it doesn't work this is the
49:44 concern they have
49:46 so is it a valid concern
49:49 well if you cannot create anything else
49:51 beyond this code and we don't plan to
49:52 probably but if you will continue
49:54 building up the product and innovating
49:56 and building the team you will be the
49:57 one
49:58 who owns all the knowledge and the
49:59 future vision of the roadmap
50:01 and then you can create and maintain the
50:03 uh open core products that's how it's
50:05 often done
50:06 so you have the open source part and you
50:08 have like some
50:09 certain functionality which is part of a
50:12 paid enterprise offering
50:14 and you as a creator of the project
50:16 knows you are the one who knows how it
50:18 really really works right so you can be
50:19 successful in maintaining you also in
50:21 the community
50:21 and companies who would want to pay for
50:23 it usually want to pay the original
50:25 developer and someone else would just
50:26 like
50:26 quit that said there is one thing uh
50:29 related to cloud providers that has been
50:31 recently a big thing in the open source
50:33 world
50:33 because another way how you monetize
50:35 machine learning or immunize open source
50:37 is that you
50:38 basically create a cloud version of your
50:39 product literally the same product but
50:41 you do
50:41 all the hosting and uh scaling and
50:44 provisioning so basically all the
50:46 devops part let's say behind it and
50:48 people literally pay for it so
50:50 just for you to run this project product
50:52 for them and for example if someone like
50:54 amazon comes and takes the same
50:56 product and hosted it like elastic
50:57 surgeries exactly so they have to
50:59 introduce a license that explicitly
51:01 promised just this part
51:02 but uh still now it's more of a
51:05 collaborative relationship with the big
51:06 cloud providers because they also don't
51:08 want to be seen as the bad guys
51:10 feeling someone else is open source and
51:12 if you do the open core you're not so
51:14 hindered by this
51:18 okay so it's not a bad idea to develop
51:22 i don't think so i don't think so but i
51:24 i think like many people are a bit too
51:25 protective over everything they do so
51:27 sometimes even like you know i don't i'm
51:28 not going to tell you my idea
51:30 i think it doesn't really work like this
51:32 it's still a lot of work
51:34 behind this behind just like what's out
51:36 there to to make it happen into your
51:38 company and
51:38 there are so many great examples like
51:40  elastic uh grafana
51:42 gitlab there's they're all open source
51:44 right and they're all huge
51:47 and take yes in case of what upon open
51:50 source uh what can happen
51:51 is that engineers data scientists find
51:54 your library they start using it
51:56 and then it reaches the management and
51:58 they see and then
52:00 you kind of sell the company the
52:04 your enterprise offer right so you don't
52:05 need to go through the management
52:07 and then kind of force the engineers to
52:10 use your solution
52:11 because the engineers are already using
52:13 it right ideally yeah so someone has a
52:15 name it's called bottom up adoption so
52:17 you come from the bottom and go up in
52:18 the company
52:19 and truth is big enterprises they want
52:21 to pay because if you're running
52:22 something in production you rely on it
52:24 so you want to make sure that someone is
52:26 responsible for how how well it performs
52:28 and
52:28 you're ready to pay for it you're an
52:30 enterprise right so you just pay for
52:32 security for safety for peace of mind
52:34 that this thing performs really well
52:36 and it's a very natural way adopting it
52:38 from the bottom up compared to say you
52:40 know
52:40 a cto who signs a big deal with some
52:42 huge you know someone like oracle
52:44 and they say it brings to you the
52:46 developer and say hey you're gonna use
52:47 this thing
52:48 and you you don't like it you don't want
52:49 to learn the thing that is uh
52:51 maybe not transferable in terms of
52:53 skills to your next place of work guys
52:55 whereas open source is something that's
52:56 going to be out there so you're like
52:57 increasing your own personal value when
52:59 you work with open source
53:00 so it's very efficient and now that
53:02 enterprises are used
53:03 to running open source and production
53:06 this business model became possible
53:09 yeah we have an interesting question now
53:11 so let's say you decide to
53:14 to create a startup or consultancy how
53:17 do you deal with clients or customers
53:20 that do not want to share their data
53:21 with you
53:23 well personally persuade them on the
53:26 ground
53:27 well but i mean you have to overcome so
53:30 many barriers when you're selling
53:31 something right so it's
53:32 uh it's a natural part of offering
53:35 enough value for people to do something
53:37 to work with you
53:38 it might be just like installing it or
53:39 running it's still like work that is
53:41 needed from their side to adopt it to
53:42 learn it so
53:43 you should just present the value so
53:46 high so that people will overcome
53:47 through this barrier and it's
53:48 in the end it's all about yeah finding
53:50 this value so this is what makes a
53:52 startup
53:52 kind of like a startup and um
53:56 have you seen any difference uh or do
53:58 you know is there any difference when
54:00 you build a startup in different
54:01 countries
54:02 for example germany russia or the united
54:05 states
54:06 yeah absolutely it's really really
54:07 different especially if your building
54:09 startups for local markets because when
54:10 it comes to venture
54:12 funded startups it's all about like your
54:14 exit opportunities so are you gonna do
54:16 an ipo and be traded on nasdaq or are
54:18 you gonna
54:19 be sold to a large uh company that's
54:22 gonna pay like
54:22 hundreds of million dollars for you and
54:24 these opportunities are different in
54:26 different markets and
54:27 the reality of the startup scene is very
54:30 different
54:31 and for example also the attitude of
54:33 investors
54:34 in europe people tend to be a bit more
54:36 risk-averse the valuations for startups
54:38 are a little bit lower
54:39 in u.s is a little bit different
54:41 especially in california where like
54:43 there's so many startups popping up and
54:45 there's like a lot of money available to
54:46 the startup so
54:47 the way how you build them like how much
54:49 money you can get
54:50 really depends specifically on the
54:52 market that you're addressing because
54:53 you can be based in germany but you can
54:55 sell
54:56 worldwide or if you are doing some
54:58 accounting software specifically focused
55:00 on the german market
55:01 you might have like eventually 100 of
55:03 this market but it's going to be very
55:04 different
55:06 i think so it it probably like a whole
55:08 big discussion but yeah there is a
55:09 difference
55:11 where you're based and if you're raising
55:12 from investors how it looks in terms of
55:14 startups and capital available
55:17 and also we think about sharing data
55:20 which goes to the previous question
55:22 that i think in europe people are more
55:25 hesitant to share the data
55:27 while maybe in russia people say okay
55:29 hear my data take it just
55:31 make sure it doesn't leave the country
55:33 you know i think it's actually easier a
55:35 bit in the u.s
55:37 yeah it's also because like people are
55:38 for example more used to using cloud
55:40 providers in general right so your data
55:42 on your sales will be in salesforce
55:44 right and many other places people still
55:45 want to keep everything on premium
55:47 but i would say you almost any startup
55:49 what you do b2b it will come to data
55:51 sharing because like even if it's just
55:52 software where you're going to put your
55:54 sales numbers right you're putting your
55:55 sales numbers it's a
55:57 it's a big deal to overcome but you can
55:59 see that many startups
56:00 made it so it's possible when you
56:02 provide enough value but open source is
56:04 now they actually
56:05 walk around around this to use an open
56:07 source tool in the early days you don't
56:08 have to sell data so it makes it so much
56:10 easier to try to compare it to you know
56:12 selling it's
56:13 sending the data somewhere to the cloud
56:16 yeah i
56:17 think um when emily did a presentation
56:19 uh
56:20 a while ago when data talks law was all
56:22 one of the questions was
56:24 uh like hey like i'm a bit concerned
56:26 about my data going to russia
56:28 right i think what you answered was that
56:31 hey it's open source you don't have to
56:32 be concerned
56:33 you just take this thing and run your on
56:35 your hardware right on your
56:37 yeah so it's open source you can run it
56:39 anywhere yeah i mean you can still like
56:41 organize it in a nice way if you send it
56:43 to the cloud you can
56:44 host it in the right location so like
56:46 all the cloud providers they allow this
56:48 but it still requires to pass through
56:50 some like safety checks in many many
56:52 cases
56:54 yeah so it is doable though it's hard
56:56 but you will have to object if you're
56:58 selling against many things like
57:00 just paying your money is also a hard
57:01 thing for companies to do
57:03 you have to convince that you're worth
57:04 it and at what point you
57:07 start thinking about hiring engineers
57:10 like
57:11 let's say i don't know we can maybe
57:13 think about evidently or maybe
57:15 some other startups so there are two
57:17 co-founders
57:18 uh at what point they should hire
57:21 somebody
57:22 well i think a when you can be when you
57:25 need so like the thing is
57:26 that sometimes you should not over hire
57:29 you know and build a huge team before
57:31 you have the so-called product market
57:32 fit when you don't even know
57:33 the thing that you're building is needed
57:35 i think it's best if it's only the
57:37 founders or very very small team is
57:38 working with because
57:40 one day you can say like hey we're gonna
57:41 throw away everything we did now let's
57:43 redo let's change the course completely
57:44 so it's better than in a very small team
57:46 and you don't want to spend a lot of
57:47 money on it
57:48 but once you understand that okay this
57:50 is the thing that we're building there's
57:51 a demand for so now we are like moving
57:52 more to the scaling phase or
57:54 to building up more features that the
57:55 users want so like to being able to
57:58 serve more users than when you should
57:59 hire but it should be guided by the
58:01 actual like business name not because
58:02 like hey
58:03 i have like a future list of 100 ideas
58:05 so i need to hire as many engineers as i
58:07 can to build all this
58:08 that's more yeah is there anyone who
58:10 really needs what you're building
58:12 okay clear and you mentioned at the
58:15 beginning that
58:18 you need to follow startups you need to
58:20 know what others are doing
58:22 uh to see what what kind of investments
58:25 they're doing what kind of things
58:26 they're doing
58:27 are they pivoting uh what kind of
58:29 clients they have
58:31 is there a way to to do this to follow
58:34 other startups
58:36 well i think you can join like so many
58:38 communities where this
58:39 once you become part of it like this
58:41 information just starts
58:42 pouring against you like you follow some
58:44 people on twitter you and some slacks
58:46 you know you read techcrunch
58:47 i wouldn't suggest you know like to just
58:49 be crazy and try to keep up with
58:50 everything that's happening
58:51 you cannot but it's just helpful if you
58:54 were not exposed to this before you know
58:56 to look at some like investment use and
58:58 maybe try to decode
58:59 hey what are they doing why were they
59:01 attractive to investors like
59:02 you know just to learn kind of like a
59:03 little bit of reverse engineer the
59:05 success
59:06 also keeping in mind that what's written
59:07 on techcrunch might not necessarily be
59:09 like you know the real thing it's also a
59:10 bit of a vision what the startup is
59:12 doing
59:12 but i suggest that it's really helpful
59:14 to get this general understanding just
59:16 by looking at others
59:17 and then maybe keeping up with the news
59:19 that are related to your domain so that
59:20 you know like who the big competitors
59:22 are because you'll definitely be asked
59:23 about it
59:25 okay thank you um i think we should be
59:28 wrapping up
59:29 do you have any last words well i think
59:32 that if you want to be a startup it's a
59:33 very good thing to try to do so
59:36 ideally in a like a nicer way
59:39 that you don't have to risk all your
59:41 money or something and this
59:42 these days is a good opportunity to to
59:44 do that i mean there is a lot of capital
59:46 available there are
59:46 a program that supports you but i also
59:48 suggest to be honest about this and
59:50 don't just like follow the hype and
59:52 thinking like hey i'm gonna be like
59:53 giving talks everywhere because i'm a
59:55 startup founder enjoy like this
59:56 social part of it because it's actually
59:58 a very hard thing to do and you
1:00:00 shouldn't go for it just for
1:00:01 fun or for money you should be genuinely
1:00:03 interested in what's going on
1:00:08 where people can find you linkedin
1:00:10 twitter
1:00:11 they probably leave some links but it's
1:00:12 always my name and surname so i'm easily
1:00:14 good
1:00:16 okay thanks a lot for joining us today
1:00:18 and appreciate
1:00:19 your experience and thanks everyone for
1:00:22 joining us as well and asking questions
1:00:26 and yeah i guess that's uh oh
1:00:29 have a great weekend thanks everyone
1:00:31 bye-bye and
