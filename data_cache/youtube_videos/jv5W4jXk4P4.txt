0:00 hello everyone thanks for coming to our
0:02 event so this event is brought to you by
0:04 data talks club which is a
0:06 community of people who like data
0:09 and we have two types of events so today
0:12 we have
0:12 a less technical event which we usually
0:15 have on fridays so this is like what we
0:17 call
0:18 live podcasts when we talk about
0:20 different topics it's just a
0:21 conversation
0:22 um without slides just talking
0:26 and today we'll talk about developer
0:29 advocacy in data science
0:30 then the next we usually have them on
0:32 friday then the next week on friday we
0:34 will talk about
0:35 ml ops what this is and we have
0:39 two a little bit unusual meetings in in
0:42 the sense that they are not on friday
0:44 so one will be next thursday
0:47 about open source how to get started
0:49 with open source
0:50 and then we'll have another one on
0:53 tuesday
0:54 in on february 12th to second
0:57 about feature stores he we intended to
1:00 do it as a technical webinar but
1:02 william who will be our guest didn't
1:04 have time to present
1:05 so we'll just have a little bit more
1:07 casual chat
1:08 and then we have a different type of
1:10 event on tuesdays
1:12 where it's a technical webinar so this
1:15 week we talked
1:16 on tuesday about model monitoring and
1:19 then the next week we'll talk about
1:21 using machine learning for customer
1:23 service so it's about chatbots
1:25 but not just how you make chatbots but
1:28 also how you
1:29 deploy them so the end-to-end
1:33 project of developing a board for
1:36 customer service
1:37 service and after that
1:40 we will have a conference um it will be
1:43 every friday there will be four talks um
1:47 on every day um there will be
1:50 one track or about use cases of machine
1:53 learning
1:54 then next friday we will talk about
1:56 product and processes then we'll talk
1:58 about career and data
2:00 and then we will talk about machine
2:01 learning production
2:03 and this event is supported by our
2:05 friends from o'reilly and machine
2:07 envelopes community um so thank you um
2:10 for supporting us and uh you can find
2:14 out more on our uh website
2:16 datatalks.club
2:17 and by the way l speaks at one of these
2:20 tracks
2:23 about machine learning production
2:26 and today when we talk
2:31 you might have some questions while
2:33 we're talking feel free to ask these
2:35 questions through slido
2:36 so you can just go up there post your
2:39 question there or if you see a question
2:41 you like you can just
2:42 upload it i will post a link right now
2:46 and i'll post it to chat
2:50 and just a little bit of preparation
2:55 okay yeah so um this week we'll talk
2:58 about
2:58 the role of a developer advocate and not
3:00 just a usual developer advocate but a
3:02 developer advocate
3:04 in data science and we have a special
3:06 guest today
3:07 l o'brien l is a data scientist at
3:11 iterative
3:13 which is a company behind dvc and cml
3:15 and if you don't know what these
3:17 three letter obligations mean dvc is
3:20 data version control and html is
3:22 continuous machine learning
3:24 and i've been following l4 uh for a
3:26 while on twitter
3:27 and recently we got connected on
3:29 linkedin
3:30 and when i was looking through through
3:33 her profile i noticed
3:34 um that one of the line was um developer
3:37 advocacy and outreach
3:39 available for speaking engagements it
3:41 wasn't just the only line there but it
3:43 got my
3:44 attention because uh this is something
3:46 i've been um
3:47 curious about this role what it means
3:49 what they do
3:50 and i wanted to talk to somebody about
3:52 that
3:53 and i decided to reach out to elle
3:55 invite her to our chat and talk more
3:57 about this
3:58 welcome thanks a lot for joining us
4:01 today
4:01 uh it's pleasure uh to have a chat with
4:04 you
4:05 yes thanks so much for having me this is
4:07 this is exciting
4:10 um before we go into our main topic of
4:12 developer advocacy
4:14 maybe you can tell us a bit about your
4:17 your background
4:18 what have you done so far and how did
4:21 you get into data science
4:22 sure um it was all kind of indirect i'm
4:25 an
4:26 ex-academic researcher um
4:29 like many people that get into data
4:30 science um so i
4:32 have worked for for the last about a
4:35 decade i worked in various areas of
4:38 neuroscience research i was a math major
4:41 in college and so
4:43 i was doing computational models
4:46 um of you know biological systems
4:50 um and i did that as an undergraduate
4:52 for a few years in research there
4:53 i did a master's degree at the
4:55 university of washington
4:57 and then i did a phd and i kind of got
5:00 all over i worked in a lot of different
5:02 labs
5:03 and a lot of a lot of different
5:07 systems we were modeling but always
5:09 using the same kind of core tools of
5:11 making computational models
5:13 um and by the end of that time i could
5:17 see that there was
5:18 a really there was a kind of growing
5:22 i don't know there was something i
5:23 really didn't want to miss in machine
5:25 learning and data science
5:26 um and part of it is that there's a lot
5:28 of methods that get used there
5:30 like non-parametric statistics um
5:33 and the approach of prediction rather
5:37 than inferential
5:38 statistics and i really wanted to
5:41 get deeper into that at the same time
5:44 i was also feeling a bit troubled by
5:47 the way that in all like so many labs
5:50 i've worked in
5:51 you know code and data sharing and
5:54 collaboration
5:55 and management is still really difficult
5:59 and it's kind of like every lab has
6:01 their own way of doing it and it's a
6:03 considerable burden
6:04 and you know it's like you have a bunch
6:06 of scientists and none of us are really
6:08 trained for how to manage data that we
6:10 have to keep for years and years or
6:12 share with the collaborator or
6:13 completely reproduce our code for
6:15 somebody else
6:16 um and so i feel like there definitely
6:19 has to be
6:20 you know a systemic change in the tools
6:23 that we give
6:23 scientists um and so i wanted to go into
6:27 you know something addressing that
6:29 problem and that's why when i was done
6:31 with my phd
6:33 um not this past november but the one
6:35 before that i i
6:36 joined i joined iterative i wanted to
6:39 work on data version control
6:42 um and so i that was kind of
6:45 it you know all of my data science
6:47 proper is kind of self-taught the way
6:49 that so many data scientists are you
6:51 know you follow tutorials you learn
6:53 um and i and i really
6:56 like getting to you know work in the
6:58 mlaps space now
7:00 um although i am in march so
7:03 just in a few weeks going to be joining
7:06 university of michigan as a full-time
7:08 lecturer and research investigator in
7:11 the school of information
7:12 and so i'm going to be doing um you know
7:15 leading some classes and developing
7:16 curriculum for the applied data science
7:19 master's program so
7:20 i'm leaning even harder into you know
7:23 how can we teach this
7:24 effectively and at scale
7:28 so you mentioned so one thing you
7:30 mentioned you said
7:32 uh that you got in another phd not the
7:36 one you got in november
7:37 does it mean you have two oh no i only
7:39 have one phd
7:44 no i was just trying to think of dates i
7:46 think then but um
7:47 yes i only have one phd okay
7:51 and so you'll be teaching uh among other
7:54 things the the tools like how to make
7:55 research
7:57 reproducible right or yeah so i'm going
8:00 to be
8:01 you know some of it is going to be
8:02 teaching statistics some is going to be
8:04 supervising
8:05 um you know students as they you know
8:08 are trying to do
8:09 end-to-end data science projects so a
8:11 lot of these people you know in an
8:12 applied data science program a lot of
8:14 them
8:14 want to go on to be data scientists and
8:16 not academic researchers
8:18 um so i'm i'm gonna do you know
8:22 i think maybe pursuing tools for
8:24 academic researchers is maybe a research
8:26 area that i like
8:28 and then my day-to-day teaching will
8:30 probably be very applied
8:31 you know how do we get junior data
8:34 scientists data scientists that are just
8:35 about to go to the workforce in a few
8:37 months
8:38 um you know at a pretty high level you
8:42 know of awareness of the issues the
8:44 knowledge of the tools in the space
8:46 you know able to make some educated
8:49 choices
8:50 about how to manage their data science
8:52 projects
8:54 yeah that's something that universities
8:56 from what i see
8:57 are missing right now this end-to-end uh
9:00 overview of of data science projects so
9:03 this is
9:04 uh this is really great this is
9:05 something that
9:07 yeah i'm so excited to do it but it's
9:09 like making a data science curriculum
9:12 it's like a lot of the work is still to
9:13 be done like we have to lay out what is
9:15 a data science curriculum and what
9:17 has to be there um and i suspect a lot
9:20 of universities are going to be doing
9:22 this in the next couple of years
9:24 um because of it's like you said i mean
9:27 and like it was in my experience most of
9:29 data science i just learned it
9:31 by googling things when i talk to you on
9:34 twitter and ask you about this
9:36 so when i reached out to you saying hey
9:39 like i want to talk to somebody about
9:41 this role of developer advocacy
9:43 and you said you replied to me that
9:47 this is such an interesting job and that
9:49 you had no idea
9:51 that this job existed until you you got
9:54 it so can you tell us this story a bit
9:56 in more details how did it happen yeah
10:00 um so i i really enjoyed you know
10:02 throughout my phd
10:04 when i wanted to get to work on data
10:06 science i would often just make myself
10:08 like weekend projects
10:10 um and so for one of them i had taken
10:13 style gan which is a big beautiful gan
10:16 that was released by nvidia with all the
10:18 code and the trained model too
10:20 um and i i trained it on
10:23 a bunch of frames from videos of myself
10:26 and different outfits i had in my closet
10:29 um and then i i made you know after it
10:31 was trained i
10:32 just moved around you know the latent
10:34 space and i patched it together and i
10:36 made a video that was just like you know
10:37 morphing on my face
10:39 with different accessories around it and
10:42 i posted it on twitter
10:44 just because i was like look at this
10:45 cool thing i made
10:47 and it did it did low-key viral it got
10:50 like
10:51 a thousand something likes which was
10:54 pretty good for my twitter at the time
10:56 and uh you know then a bunch of people
10:59 noticed it
11:00 and um oh i think we have one more troll
11:04 here
11:04 i think okay cool um
11:08 so um i had posted this thing on twitter
11:11 and um i got just a
11:14 message actually no it was after that i
11:16 just said hey and by the way i'm looking
11:18 for jobs i figured since i was one month
11:20 away from graduating did not have a job
11:22 and i had this thing on twitter that was
11:24 doing well i just made a tweet
11:25 by the way consider hiring me and
11:29 um then dimitri who's the ceo
11:32 at iterative saw it and he said hey
11:34 we're looking for somebody for devrel
11:35 and i guess the audition that i had done
11:38 was i made a piece of content involving
11:40 machine learning that people
11:42 you know wanted to
11:45 wanted to see um so that that started it
11:49 so i learned from him
11:50 that there are in fact teams that make
11:52 things that are looking for people who
11:54 will take the tools they make make
11:56 something cool with them to show other
11:58 people
11:59 um and just getting attention on the
12:02 internet
12:03 is a viable career path okay so
12:06 basically you
12:07 [Music]
12:08 play it with a tool you put it on
12:10 twitter
12:12 it went viral and then you mentioned
12:14 okay i'm
12:15 looking for a job and boom you got it
12:17 right yes exactly
12:18 so that's a nice uh nice story
12:22 uh yeah but uh
12:26 your job is uh not just the devrel right
12:28 so you're also doing uh
12:30 data science things you're also involved
12:33 in uh
12:33 creating these tools right so how does
12:35 your day look like what do you do
12:39 there's a lot of different stuff um
12:42 so i also work on the product team for
12:45 continuous machine learning or cml
12:47 so i help you know kind of organize the
12:50 launch for that
12:51 you know making the website all of our
12:53 examples our tutorials so
12:55 a lot of the work i also do is you know
12:57 in our docs for that project
12:59 um you know and trying to understand
13:02 user feedback on it
13:04 so making some new features um i'm very
13:08 proud i i added a pr for support
13:11 for bitbucket cloud um recently to that
13:15 so um you know so i do a little bit of
13:18 development but i'm really learning
13:20 software development you know i
13:22 developed software for years as an
13:24 academic but it is just not the same as
13:26 doing
13:27 development for an open source project
13:29 so i'm kind of like i treat this almost
13:31 as an apprenticeship that i get to learn
13:33 that
13:34 um as i go um
13:37 and yeah so you know there's a lot of a
13:40 lot of conferences that i go to
13:42 so i do a lot of speaking gigs i do
13:45 videos
13:46 i try to shoot a video at least every
13:47 few weeks um
13:49 you know now i kind of have like a list
13:51 of things that some users want
13:53 and trying to you know trying to hit
13:55 those
13:56 um what else do i do
13:59 um quite a lot right now we're hiring
14:02 more developer advocates
14:04 so right now i'm a team of one so you
14:06 know we're growing and also because i'm
14:08 gonna be reducing
14:09 my my time as i you know am at a
14:12 university
14:12 um so we're working on hiring so the
14:15 hiring process takes quite a bit
14:18 um i do a lot of blog post writing um
14:21 another thing that takes time that you
14:23 know like you don't really
14:25 see or expect is you know you have to
14:27 create code examples for everything
14:30 so when we have a new you know new tool
14:32 or a feature that i want to highlight
14:34 um you know it often takes a couple days
14:36 to create
14:37 you know a good technical use case and
14:40 so it's like you know you're sitting
14:41 there you're coding you're getting a
14:42 data set
14:43 um you know it's kind of like a mini
14:45 mini data science project and then at
14:47 the end you have to make sure it's all
14:48 completely reproducible readable it's
14:50 like turning in a
14:51 a report um so those those are kind of
14:54 fun
14:55 um but that's some like you know labor
14:57 that i didn't expect
14:58 but you know it's it's part of it
15:02 so you're doing a lot of blog posts a
15:04 lot of speaking
15:06 videos and videos i see that you post
15:08 constantly on youtube channel
15:10 then creating this um reproducible code
15:14 snippets
15:14 that's a lot of things how do you decide
15:16 which to work on next
15:18 like and also assuming that uh
15:22 just you said just you're just a team of
15:25 one right
15:26 and there are so many things to do like
15:27 how do you decide what should be
15:29 the next most important thing it's hard
15:33 it's really hard you know what i often
15:35 do is i kind of have a schedule in mind
15:38 of when are we planning to release this
15:40 and i know when we have a release of
15:41 something then i'm probably going to
15:43 have to really
15:44 pitch in on that maybe on you know
15:46 adding some area of docs perhaps
15:48 you know something like that and working
15:51 on all the messaging around the release
15:52 and blogs for that so those are like big
15:54 landmarks in my time like i know i've
15:56 got to work on a release then
15:58 and in between those then i get a bit
15:59 more freedom to you know
16:01 we're going to make a video about a
16:02 topic that is kind of timeless doesn't
16:04 matter i could release this now or next
16:06 year and it would be you know
16:07 still interesting um but
16:10 it is quite hard to keep them all
16:14 going you know and so sometimes i feel
16:16 like i'm actually debating for the first
16:18 time ever like maybe i need to put a
16:20 limit on how many talks i
16:22 accept because of you know it it does
16:25 take away from the time that you can be
16:27 writing
16:28 um and they're all important activities
16:31 so
16:32 you know it's it's it's really not
16:34 obvious or easy a lot of it is just like
16:36 it's an experiment on the run
16:38 and i just feel i feel like we're due
16:39 for a blog now i feel like we're due for
16:41 a video
16:44 so it's more like a feeling and plus
16:46 like you know that there is a certain
16:48 release
16:48 so you know that you need to prepare for
16:50 this release to prepare some supporting
16:51 material
16:52 good documentations good use cases and
16:54 then
16:56 we also need to stick around like on
16:58 hacker news or
16:59 reddit or do things like that like when
17:02 you release something then you publish
17:04 an article
17:05 and then you know i i think
17:08 your post ended up on hiking news a
17:10 couple of times right
17:12 yeah yeah we've had that a few times and
17:14 this is another thing i didn't expect
17:16 but
17:16 when you put something on hacker news or
17:18 reddit but you know
17:20 whether you posted it or it's just
17:21 trending there you have to be there
17:24 it actually is like a whole day event
17:26 when something goes big on social
17:28 um which i did not expect to be a thing
17:31 that takes up
17:32 time like if i post a little thing on
17:34 social like hey
17:35 we have a newsletter out like i don't
17:37 have to monitor that but when it's like
17:38 we have a release
17:40 it's like the next eight hours is like
17:42 i'm on three different social networks
17:44 like tabbing back and forth going okay
17:46 answer any questions answering ques you
17:47 know respond um
17:50 so it's it's actually a pretty big
17:52 production
17:53 and in hiking news also like because uh
17:57 it's anonymous many people i can just
18:00 register there and
18:01 put all kind of things there like write
18:03 all kind of things there
18:04 like sometimes the level of toxicity
18:06 there in this community is
18:08 pretty high i would say yeah how do you
18:11 deal with that as well
18:12 like it's probably not easy it's not
18:15 actually that is another thing i didn't
18:17 expect is that you really have to pick
18:19 and choose what internet communities you
18:21 can be on
18:22 and i find hacker news and our machine
18:25 learning
18:25 are both like there is a high level of
18:28 toxicity and it's usually
18:29 not not long if i'm just browsing them
18:32 before i find something that i'm like
18:34 oh i really wish i hadn't read this
18:36 today
18:38 um this does not make me feel great um
18:41 and i
18:42 thought that i would like over time get
18:44 a thicker skin for them
18:45 and i didn't like it actually never gets
18:47 easier i find for that so i find like i
18:49 dig in harder on twitter
18:51 because i like twitter better you know
18:54 the data science community
18:56 there um and for hacker news i kind of
18:59 go
18:59 as needed i know it would be better if i
19:02 was like a regular participant
19:04 and got more you know internet points um
19:07 but i i i don't do that too much
19:11 um and reddit machine learning i do i
19:13 answer a couple questions like
19:16 every month to kind of keep the account
19:18 current but other than that i don't
19:19 really
19:20 hang out there which is a little bit
19:22 weird when you're advocating in
19:23 communities that
19:24 you're not really a part of um
19:27 but luckily we do have you know i'm
19:30 pretty well embedded on twitter
19:31 and you know i have a couple of data
19:33 science slacks and you have a data
19:34 science slacks and those are kind of
19:36 more comfortable safe spaces i feel like
19:38 to
19:38 you know share something get feedback um
19:41 and so i definitely like you know i take
19:43 advantage of those too
19:47 yeah thank you um i i was
19:50 since i was pretty curious about this
19:52 throw so what i decided to do is just
19:54 take a random job description of a
19:57 developer advocate
19:58 for a company and see what it says
20:02 and i found this it was just i found it
20:06 in some slug
20:07 and it was saying that in
20:09 responsibilities so the first point was
20:12 um you need to build an open source
20:13 community for the company from scratch
20:16 not for the company but for the product
20:18 they have so that was one thing so
20:20 building an open source community then
20:21 the second point was to drive a
20:24 awareness of this product by speaking at
20:27 three to six industry events quarterly
20:29 writing blog posts
20:31 tutorials creating videos building
20:33 examples of using
20:34 um this product for demonstration
20:36 purposes
20:37 and building excitement around this
20:40 product
20:41 and then there was a third product third
20:43 point sorry
20:44 be the voice of the community in our
20:46 development process
20:48 um like is this uh a representative
20:51 description
20:51 of uh of a of a position or it's maybe
20:55 something like
20:56 more a full stack what do you think it
20:59 is quite representative um and
21:03 i would say that it's because i think
21:05 companies still have a lot of work to do
21:08 learning how to hire devrel and what
21:11 devrel should do
21:12 like this is probably pretty close to
21:14 what i expected i would be able to do
21:17 um as one devrel and i very quickly
21:20 realized that this is not
21:22 actually that realistic if you want to
21:25 do a good job on all three of those
21:27 and part of that is that i think that
21:29 people tend to believe especially people
21:30 that like
21:31 don't do devrel or don't have experience
21:33 in it so like i think a lot of like
21:36 a lot of you know technical founders
21:38 probably um
21:40 believe that community building is the
21:41 same as content creation and
21:43 presentation
21:44 and they're just completely different
21:45 skill sets like
21:47 and i've i've worked with um you know
21:49 i've kind of
21:50 had a lot of discussions with other
21:52 devrels that have helped me kind of
21:54 appreciate the distinction which is not
21:58 appreciated by all or even most
22:00 companies that are hiring i think but
22:02 that like creating building a community
22:05 is something that you know it's it
22:07 requires a great deal of face to face
22:09 not face to face but like you know
22:11 interaction like real-time interaction
22:13 like you actually have to be
22:14 in the slack or in the subreddit you
22:16 know or twitter you have to be there you
22:18 have to be responding to people
22:19 constantly
22:20 having conversations facilitating bigger
22:23 discussions
22:24 um and you have to do a lot of
22:26 moderation
22:27 you know you have to you really have to
22:29 be a
22:31 leader of you know a lot of interactions
22:34 and but on the other hand creating
22:37 content
22:38 and videos and demonstrations requires a
22:41 great deal of
22:42 independent solo and focused time
22:45 like you cannot really do a good job you
22:48 know unless you're gonna just switch
22:50 them up constantly like
22:51 which i do but it's very very hectic um
22:54 and i don't think it's sustainable in
22:55 the long term and that's part of why
22:57 we're growing our
22:58 devrel so i guess if i could say one
23:00 thing to people that want to hire devrel
23:02 it's
23:02 you know consider separating people who
23:04 are really strong content creators
23:06 from people who are community managers
23:09 because of
23:10 managing community reaching out to
23:12 people and keeping them engaged
23:14 is like a kind of engineering almost
23:16 it's like a social engineering of how do
23:17 i create the right conditions for cool
23:19 things to happen and people will want to
23:21 show up
23:22 and content creation is it's just a much
23:26 more like
23:26 almost solo like focused activity
23:30 and those are i'm not sure why those got
23:31 put on the same
23:33 like oh obviously the same person would
23:35 do these other than maybe
23:36 they're just you know activities that
23:39 aren't engineering
23:41 and there is also this third point uh
23:44 like
23:44 be the voice of the community is this uh
23:47 something that
23:48 uh the developer advocates do yeah i
23:51 mean i
23:51 try well so the idea i think
23:55 is that you know if you hang around the
23:57 community a lot
23:58 you will pick up on what issues people
24:01 are having what bugs they have what
24:03 feature requests
24:04 what what are the big like blocks for
24:06 them you know
24:07 in getting engaged with what you make
24:09 because right you want it to be so easy
24:11 that you know
24:12 to get started and you know you learn
24:14 pretty quickly if you're
24:15 around like the support channel perhaps
24:17 you know
24:18 um like we have a discord where people
24:20 come ask questions and you learn pretty
24:21 quickly like okay what are the common
24:23 stumbling blocks that people are facing
24:25 and what are the things that people ask
24:27 for over and over again that we would be
24:30 really silly to miss those signals
24:32 um and to some extent you know
24:35 i can do that but on the other hand it's
24:37 it's the same issue of
24:39 if i'm in this you know support channel
24:42 then i'm
24:43 not on twitter or i'm not giving a talk
24:46 or i'm not
24:47 creating content um and
24:50 also building a community is different
24:53 from
24:54 answering technical questions from users
24:56 so
24:57 it's actually it's something i can do
24:59 but
25:00 i feel like to really excel at it i
25:02 might need to be more full-time embedded
25:04 you know in support or in a you know
25:07 with the users more of the time and with
25:10 that said
25:11 my team is very you know software
25:13 engineer heavy and
25:15 i might be the only one who has
25:18 like i don't know if this is true but
25:21 there's not a lot of people who have
25:22 experience
25:24 doing like data science and i would also
25:26 include my academic research in this
25:28 where we have data sets we're
25:29 you know modeling it analyzing it and we
25:32 want to have like a reproducible
25:33 pipeline
25:34 you know that generates our results and
25:36 since i do have that experience and
25:38 my technical background is probably like
25:40 a lot of data scientists i can try out
25:42 our tools you know be like
25:44 a beta tester and you know give pretty
25:47 pretty incisive feedback i think about
25:49 you know
25:49 what part of this would just not be
25:51 intuitive you know
25:52 for for a typical data scientist with
25:55 our highly variable backgrounds
26:00 okay it makes sense so basically uh it's
26:02 more like a full stack
26:03 right like in full data science we have
26:06 somebody
26:07 who can do talking to stakeholders then
26:10 build data pipelines then train a model
26:13 then
26:14 roll the model out to production and
26:16 then i don't know
26:17 support this model so it's in a way like
26:20 it's five different people like when we
26:21 talk about a full stack data scientist
26:23 in
26:24 and here it's the same right so you have
26:25 like a community manager
26:27 you have a uh i don't know how you call
26:30 it like
26:31 not content manager but somebody who who
26:33 is creating content
26:34 who's producing content right and then
26:36 uh like the third point would be
26:39 um i don't know like uh
26:42 not customer support but in in a way
26:44 something similar right
26:46 yeah really you can analyze a lot of
26:48 signals coming out of your community
26:50 you know and we don't even make use of a
26:52 lot of you know there's so much
26:54 information you can get from your
26:55 community in so many ways metrics
26:57 and interactions you could easily have a
27:00 full-time job doing that
27:03 and i could often come across
27:07 uh this uh so there is a developer
27:10 advocates and then there is a role also
27:12 called uh devrel like are they similar
27:15 are they the same
27:16 uh are they different uh
27:20 i am not completely sure and i i hope if
27:24 i'm wrong somebody will come and
27:25 go actually it's this but
27:28 i think they're the same
27:32 and evangelists is it also something in
27:34 that
27:35 uh in that area i
27:38 think so yeah i i feel like
27:42 i would feel pretty sim you know like oh
27:44 i have a lot in common with you if i met
27:46 somebody who was an evangelist i would
27:47 feel like it's quite similar
27:50 yeah to me it seems like evangelists
27:52 they more uh
27:53 they're more often on the stage uh you
27:55 know giving talks
27:56 and then uh you know even evangelizing
28:00 is it the word like basically talking
28:02 about uh about the product and then
28:04 getting people excited
28:05 uh so this is actually one one of the
28:08 points in this uh
28:09 in this job description was building
28:11 excitement around uh
28:13 the product so probably this is what an
28:16 evangelist would do right like getting
28:18 people excited about
28:20 uh about things
28:23 yes it's interesting in the us um the
28:26 word evangelist is mostly used with
28:28 religious
28:29 like preachers so i think of somebody
28:31 who'd be like on tv
28:32 on sunday morning you know preaching and
28:35 being like
28:36 call in for your free bible today so and
28:39 it gets people extremely excited and you
28:41 know
28:42 i i think of it like that but for but
28:45 for something
28:46 in tech so call today for
28:49 your free aws credits writers yes
28:53 yeah the yeah actually
28:56 um i the the reason i'm interested in
29:00 this uh in this
29:01 role is um some time ago somebody from
29:04 aws reached out to me saying hey we have
29:07 this
29:07 position called developer advocate and
29:10 then i never
29:11 actually thought about this position at
29:13 all um
29:14 but then i thought okay like uh
29:18 the description looks kind of similar to
29:20 what i'm doing uh like you know
29:22 giving talks and then you know producing
29:25 content
29:26 and i thought okay this uh this could be
29:28 interesting
29:29 um like an interesting an interesting
29:31 position
29:33 um and then i also i ask this
29:36 i talk to some people and many of them
29:41 said like mentioned things like you did
29:43 like
29:44 that the people in the aws they have to
29:47 go to
29:47 trade it hacker news and see
29:50 all this uh toxicity and deal with that
29:54 especially like there's a certain amount
29:56 of hatred towards aws in these
29:58 communities for some reasons i don't
30:00 know
30:01 um so it's not that glorious right it's
30:05 not just
30:07 from what i understood so some people
30:09 think it's like a springboard
30:10 to being famous right like you're on the
30:13 stage you're talking all the time
30:15 uh but also there there are downsides
30:18 um really true it's
30:22 really true and i did not plan for that
30:25 i think i always thought internet points
30:27 good and then when it was my job i have
30:30 to say like
30:31 there's it's really scary when something
30:33 is trending or going big
30:35 because of there's just a tremendous
30:37 amount of online abuse
30:39 and you know it it just it happens quite
30:43 a lot and so i actually experience like
30:45 a great deal of fear sometimes when
30:47 things are going big or
30:48 you know sometimes it's kind of panicky
30:50 and it's not really that fun
30:52 and like you said i mean there are i
30:55 know hacker news is like the place to be
30:57 but it's not a place i i really feel
31:00 great reading i don't feel
31:02 better you know and sometimes i'll come
31:03 across stuff that's quite extreme on it
31:06 and i'm really troubled by
31:07 um and it's really hard to you know feel
31:11 like
31:11 every day i'm gonna show up and try to
31:13 evangelize there when i
31:15 don't even wanna be there um and so
31:18 those those things are really really
31:22 difficult
31:22 and like you said they're not glorious
31:26 and how to deal with that let's say
31:27 somebody is really excited about this
31:31 uh position but uh this role but there
31:33 are
31:34 these downsides so how like do you have
31:36 any recommendations to people
31:38 like how to deal with this uh online and
31:41 use on the internet
31:44 i mean i i don't i mean part of it is
31:46 just like because of
31:48 i don't know that many devils yet like
31:50 i'm still kind of growing into the
31:52 community a bit
31:53 you know i feel like there's got to be
31:55 some solidarity and experience in that
31:57 you know
31:58 and people supporting one another part
32:00 of it is that i think platforms have to
32:02 you know get better
32:03 at moderating and you know i i feel like
32:06 it is really easy to get
32:07 harassed on even you know places that
32:10 have a nicer community like twitter
32:12 where you know
32:13 everybody has their face and their name
32:15 most of the time it's very easy to get
32:16 harassed and i've seen it happen to a
32:18 lot of people in machine learning
32:20 you know devrel or not when you have a
32:21 big opinion
32:23 people will come for you and i think
32:25 that you know if you
32:26 are underrepresented in some way like if
32:29 you're a woman or
32:30 you know you you are not white i feel
32:32 like they can come for you even harder
32:34 um and so that can be pretty tough
32:37 like on some forums i'm anonymous like
32:40 my hacker knows i
32:41 make it pretty not traceable to you know
32:44 who i
32:44 am but then sometimes you can't avoid it
32:46 you know um
32:48 so you know if you're posting like i
32:51 made this and there's only three people
32:53 on this project you know
32:57 i mean they can figure it out um
33:00 but i also just make sure i have like i
33:02 try to make a safe online presence like
33:03 i try to make it i check pretty
33:05 regularly like okay if somebody were to
33:06 try to harass me or dox me what could
33:08 they find
33:09 and i try to keep that pretty minimal so
33:11 sometimes i'll like
33:12 make sure that you know if i see an
33:14 embarrassing picture of me somewhere
33:16 that's from like 2009 i will like write
33:18 that
33:19 right that website and be like will you
33:21 please take down this picture of me
33:22 you know things like that but i i just i
33:25 feel like there has to be some
33:26 solidarity you know for that being a
33:28 rough experience for anybody
33:30 devrel professionally or not who makes
33:33 things for the internet
33:34 um and so commiserating with people
33:36 helps a bit um
33:38 and it has to be known that it's a job
33:40 hazard like i feel like
33:42 you know if i were supervising on
33:44 somebody
33:45 with this and they said i really need a
33:47 break from hacker news for a bit
33:49 you know i would grant that because
33:53 i would i think that's valid because you
33:55 can't burn out
33:56 you know and i'd even say if you're not
33:58 okay posting here
34:00 i mean maybe we gotta find other avenues
34:03 but i know that for early stage startups
34:05 i mean it's really it is a material
34:07 benefit
34:08 being on the front page of hacker news
34:10 it does change things for you so it's
34:12 it's like i recognize the business value
34:14 of it and i will still do it because of
34:16 i'm
34:16 i'm all in on my startup you know but
34:19 it's
34:21 you know i just made a piece i guess
34:24 there that like okay
34:25 i'm doing this for what it takes you
34:27 know yeah it's
34:28 uh it's sad but there are definitely
34:30 advantages of this role right and uh
34:33 do you think is it is a springboard to
34:35 being famous
34:36 or uh or not really i mean
34:40 like maybe a low-key kind of fame
34:44 like you know in the community not like
34:46 uh on national tv
34:48 or anything yeah yeah
34:51 it's like i feel like it's really
34:52 interesting that like as i've done this
34:54 job like i've done
34:56 i get a lot more followers i get a lot
34:58 more talk invitations and i love that
35:00 but then like my family has no idea what
35:02 that means you know it's not like to the
35:04 people that
35:05 i'm close with that they sense anything
35:07 different
35:08 other than that i'm invited to a lot
35:10 more talks
35:11 um but getting invited to talks is
35:13 really rewarding and like you get to be
35:14 on panels with amazing
35:16 people and the more talks you're in like
35:17 the more you meet people and you hear
35:19 from people
35:20 you know like perspectives that you
35:21 would never have heard before
35:23 and so the benefit i mean other than the
35:26 risk of
35:27 burnout that part is so cool um
35:31 you know it's it is cool but at the same
35:34 time having a lot of followers gets
35:36 scary because of the more followers you
35:38 get the more you're worried about
35:39 disappointing them
35:40 so sometimes i feel like i post less
35:42 risky or adventurous things than i might
35:44 if i was had like a hundred twitter
35:46 followers
35:48 and then again you have some
35:50 responsibility right and it
35:52 it also can turn bad uh because of the
35:54 things we just talked about and the
35:56 online abuse and all that right
35:58 right like they're actually here for
36:00 your brand like you know you
36:02 when you are a devrel what you're
36:04 monetizing is your brand
36:06 and for some people that's very close to
36:08 their personal life but like for me it's
36:10 not like i don't you know want to tweet
36:12 a lot about my
36:13 my personal life um you know
36:17 so they really are here for a certain
36:19 brand of things and so
36:20 you know it's kind of a personal choice
36:22 about how much do you want to reveal
36:24 about yourself
36:25 um but in a sense it means like yeah
36:27 it's
36:28 it's me but it's also not me it's it's
36:32 it's cultivated and it's intentional and
36:34 it's like you know i
36:35 i do edit you know it's it's it's all
36:38 very intentional
36:39 and i think that if you're a devrel and
36:41 you want to have like you know
36:42 sustainability
36:43 you know you have to be careful about
36:45 like what kind of things do you want to
36:47 share regularly
36:50 yeah and for somebody who wants to
36:53 become
36:54 a devrel um so what kind of skills they
36:57 need to develop
36:59 so i mean the big one it's it's both the
37:02 technical work and the communication
37:04 like you have to be credible you know as
37:06 somebody who
37:08 knows tech but i don't think it's
37:10 important that you know
37:11 you know that you start working at a
37:13 team or a company knowing everything
37:15 about their
37:15 their product i feel like if you know
37:18 how to learn
37:19 like i feel like the biggest skill i got
37:21 from
37:22 my years and years of academic research
37:24 was like okay i can jump into a new lab
37:26 or a new project and i don't know
37:28 anything in their stack but i can learn
37:29 it pretty quickly
37:31 um and so i'm not like an expert in any
37:33 of these but i can get started
37:35 in a couple minutes and i just like i
37:37 know how to be a beginner
37:39 and i feel like that you know
37:42 anything new that comes across the desk
37:44 like i'm not afraid to try i'm not
37:45 afraid to ask stupid questions and you
37:48 know figure it out
37:49 and you know the kind of experience that
37:51 you get not necessarily knowing like i
37:53 don't know everything in the ml ops
37:55 world like there are lots of tools in
37:56 the space that i've never tried
37:58 and i'm pretty comfortable saying yeah i
38:00 don't know how that works i don't know
38:01 what it is
38:02 um but you have to have some credibility
38:06 you know about your own knowledge of the
38:09 space
38:09 that you know people will trust you as
38:12 as an expert so someone that should have
38:14 influence
38:15 um and there's lots of ways to get that
38:17 um you know
38:19 there are lots of different ways to do
38:20 it um
38:22 and and on the other hand i mean you
38:25 just you have to be clear
38:27 um a lot of people who write you know
38:30 i don't know i think the biggest
38:31 difference between experienced technical
38:33 communicators and
38:34 not experienced technical communicators
38:36 is you know
38:38 after a while you learn what details to
38:41 cut
38:41 so that people really just focus on
38:43 what's important
38:44 um and it's you know you just sometimes
38:47 you have to
38:48 not be afraid to be simple and plain in
38:50 your language
38:52 um because of that's getting people to
38:55 understand is much more important than
38:57 showing everything you know um
39:00 and so you know the communication has to
39:02 be there so it's it's a combination of
39:04 like
39:06 can you at least do you look like you
39:08 know something about what you're doing
39:10 and can you be clear to people who are
39:13 really coming from a lot of different
39:15 very different backgrounds you know can
39:17 you try to put yourself in the shoes of
39:18 somebody new
39:20 and say things how how they need to hear
39:22 it
39:23 okay so basically being able to learn
39:25 and being able to teach her two key
39:27 skills right i think so yeah okay
39:31 yeah and
39:34 how important is to have
39:37 like a technical background so for
39:39 example uh
39:40 you uh like the videos you do they're
39:44 about a technical tool right so you need
39:46 to know
39:47 all these things so at a good level
39:50 right so you need to also to be able to
39:51 answer questions
39:52 so not just a beginner but also
39:54 especially about your
39:56 own product but how this product can
39:58 work with some other things
39:59 so you need to have this technical
40:01 background right
40:02 uh to to be able to do that yeah
40:07 and if somebody without that technical
40:09 background wants to start
40:12 to be a devrel um would be a problem for
40:15 them or
40:16 what do you think like how important it
40:18 is to have that
40:19 i think it is not important to have a
40:22 formal technical background
40:24 um i think that there are a lot of ways
40:27 to learn
40:28 you know the things that i would want to
40:29 see would be
40:32 blogs about you know like start with a
40:33 blog about something that you're
40:34 teaching yourself like teach yourself
40:36 something and it can be you know
40:38 something that's kind of basic
40:40 and then you can write a blog about it
40:42 and how you learned it and you know
40:43 what did you do like make a little
40:45 tutorial for somebody else and it kind
40:46 of serves as like a note for yourself
40:48 and a bit of a lesson because when you
40:49 try to teach someone
40:50 you learn it even better um you know it
40:54 really can be
40:55 you know fairly simple stuff that you
40:57 start with um
40:59 i think that that kind of technical
41:01 skills i really really think it can be
41:04 gained and i know people that have
41:06 transitioned into data science
41:08 you know jobs devrel and not that
41:11 you know their background is like i have
41:12 a master's in marine biology
41:14 or you know something that's kind of
41:15 like maybe tech adjacent
41:17 i also know people that like gosh i mean
41:20 i work with a guy who um
41:22 not at not at iterative but um at uh
41:25 what's it called
41:26 um at michigan he has like a history phd
41:30 and he taught himself you know software
41:32 development and data science
41:34 skills and now he's one of the
41:35 instructors um so
41:37 i i think there is a lot of room
41:41 for people who are coming in from a
41:43 non-technical background and in fact
41:45 when it can be an asset in a way
41:48 that you really do get the experience of
41:51 being a beginner
41:52 and you can learn like what was it like
41:54 like when i was a beginner at this
41:55 what parts of this were really confusing
41:58 for me and then
41:59 you take note of that and then you know
42:01 that you know you take that with you
42:03 um and that i think for me like all the
42:06 times i didn't know is actually the most
42:08 informative for this job
42:11 so basically like if somebody who is not
42:14 super technical who doesn't work as a
42:16 software engineer right now
42:18 one way of of getting this position of
42:21 becoming a developer advocate would be
42:23 learning in public right so you just
42:26 learn something put it to
42:30 put it online uh write an article about
42:33 this
42:34 and this is how you do this right so you
42:36 start communicating about your learning
42:38 process
42:39 then people notice you and then maybe
42:42 your tweet goes viral and then you
42:43 mention that
42:44 you know by the way i'm looking for a
42:46 job and this is
42:48 this is a good recipe of uh getting a
42:50 job in
42:51 in in as a developer as a kid
42:55 yeah it's definitely what i recommend to
42:57 people is start
42:58 blogging you know in a platform that
43:00 you'd like medium is a good one there's
43:02 towards data science you know is a
43:04 really good
43:05 place for you know there's a lot of
43:07 beginner ones there
43:08 um yeah post on twitter
43:12 if you're in the r community i really
43:14 recommend like our bloggers you can also
43:16 go like you know language specific sites
43:18 and aggregators
43:19 um but just start just start making
43:22 things
43:25 yeah it makes sense but usually you talk
43:28 to
43:29 to other developer advocates the rails
43:31 what kind of backgrounds
43:33 do they have what kind of background did
43:35 they have before becoming
43:36 the rail is there some pattern that you
43:38 saw like
43:40 are they usually uh you know like were
43:44 they in the past software engineers or
43:46 it's really there is no pattern in my
43:49 experience they tend to be
43:51 and this is not all by far
43:54 but i noticed that there's a lot of
43:55 people that are kind of
43:57 creative like working on a lot of
43:59 different things like learning things
44:01 um there's kind of a i don't know
44:04 there's often a little bit of silliness
44:05 too
44:06 you know like a lot of us really like i
44:08 think
44:09 you know having a lighthearted tone and
44:12 we like making things that are going to
44:13 make people laugh
44:15 i think a lot of the best deverells are
44:17 people that like
44:18 i don't know maybe would have been
44:20 comedians or something
44:22 you know in another life
44:26 but it's you don't have to be funny to
44:28 be a devrel but i do notice
44:30 a lot of my favorites you know they
44:33 really
44:34 they're funny people but other than that
44:36 i mean i really
44:38 i do think one of the cool things about
44:39 data science in general you know devrel
44:41 or not
44:42 is that there's just a lot of different
44:44 backgrounds here
44:46 yeah being funny is probably one of the
44:48 ways of building connection with the
44:50 audience
44:51 and this is what you need to do as a
44:52 developer right to build this connection
44:55 so people can relate to what you're
44:56 saying to listen to your stories and
44:59 actually
45:00 go and want to try the product your um
45:04 you're advocating for yeah this is
45:06 probably uh
45:08 this is the pattern you're seeing that
45:10 these people are
45:11 relatable and easy to connect okay so
45:14 and the background doesn't really matter
45:16 in this case right
45:17 the person can be a software engineer in
45:19 the past
45:20 or somebody from marketing or
45:24 somebody with background in history
45:26 right
45:28 um but let's say
45:32 i i this role sounds interesting so
45:36 like i want to become famous talk to uh
45:39 you know go to conferences talk to
45:42 people
45:43 um be on the stage in the spotlight but
45:45 how to understand that this is indeed
45:47 for me
45:50 because it does sound amazing except for
45:52 the parts
45:53 that we talked about
45:57 let's say i i think it might be for me
45:59 but i don't want to quit my job right
46:01 now
46:02 and go ahead and try it just to find out
46:04 two months after that that
46:06 it's not for me is there a way to check
46:09 if i would enjoy this kind of work or
46:10 not
46:11 i mean to some extent yes if you a lot
46:14 of people who
46:15 you know are full-time developers
46:17 they're data scientists they maintain
46:18 blogs and they maintain twitter
46:20 presences
46:21 um and i feel like that is very close to
46:23 what it's like
46:24 but at the same time it's kind of like
46:28 you know it's like any time you take
46:29 something that was your hobby and you
46:30 turned it into your full-time job
46:32 it's just completely different it's like
46:34 people on instagram who are like i'm
46:36 quitting my job to be a full-time baker
46:39 and post videos on instagram and then
46:41 they go oh man
46:42 i didn't expect there to be so much like
46:43 growth hacking and all these things i do
46:45 just to try to
46:47 get content you know get people to look
46:49 and i didn't really know about that you
46:51 know
46:52 and in that way i think it's actually
46:54 harder for me than i expected but maybe
46:57 if you're somebody who's really
46:58 strategic
46:59 and enjoys being strategic about your
47:02 content that could be a good signal
47:04 um if you find you know that you want to
47:07 be blogging
47:08 all the time that is a good sign
47:12 um you know or if you're into the
47:14 community management side like
47:16 if you really want to be leading a
47:18 community and interacting with people
47:20 all day
47:20 like you know if you just want to hang
47:22 out on your discord server
47:24 you know much more than you want to code
47:26 that that could be a good
47:27 sign um but it's kind of it's kind of
47:30 like
47:31 it's just it's a little hard i think
47:33 until you're really putting in a lot of
47:35 hours over a long time because for me i
47:37 mean it's like
47:39 just that all these things take up more
47:41 time than i ever expected
47:43 um is maybe the biggest downside
47:46 like it's it's definitely a job i would
47:48 still recommend to a lot of people
47:51 but to be totally honest about it i mean
47:53 it is hard to
47:54 not have time for no or not as much time
47:57 for like research and development
47:59 um because of you are spending so much
48:01 on content and growing your audience so
48:06 this was one of the
48:07 you mentioned that people don't consider
48:09 that it will involve a lot of growth
48:10 hiking and things like that
48:12 but it actually does involve these
48:14 things right
48:15 it can yeah do you have any
48:18 tips like for growth hacking none i am
48:22 not a good growth hacker
48:24 um i after a certain point i just you
48:26 know i i talked to a dimitri and i was
48:28 just like i really don't know how to
48:30 growth hack
48:31 i don't have that skill set and i'm not
48:33 really that interested in learning it
48:35 either
48:36 um so i think if you want that
48:39 it's going to have to come from somebody
48:40 else okay
48:42 so yeah i simply don't and that's
48:44 another thing like that's a skill set
48:46 that people might assume like oh because
48:48 of i write blogs and make videos i know
48:50 all about social media you know and how
48:52 to keep up an audience
48:54 and i really don't um so you know it's
48:58 just like i just go by and i guess my
49:00 philosophy is i don't believe in like
49:02 cheap views you know like i know you can
49:04 write a click bait title to get people
49:06 to
49:07 show up but i don't believe they'll keep
49:09 showing up if you do that
49:11 and um that's another thing like
49:13 sometimes people
49:14 really care about metrics they want to
49:15 see your audience taking off
49:17 you know or like yeah i did have more
49:20 views on my youtube channel when i
49:21 could release a video every single week
49:23 but i simply can't keep up that pace
49:26 so i mean i'm really like
49:29 absolutely dogmatically like maybe
49:32 i will do things sustainably and slowly
49:35 and i do not want my metrics to spike i
49:38 want a
49:39 organic real growth that i could sustain
49:42 and i will do that by continuing
49:44 to release quality content at a schedule
49:46 i can manage
49:47 um so that's my philosophy but it is
49:51 i mean if you're a startup yeah you want
49:53 big numbers sometimes and you want to be
49:54 able to show your investors big numbers
49:57 um so there's there's a whole other side
50:00 of it that
50:02 other devrels are probably more
50:05 qualified to answer that than me
50:08 but you do make your videos quite
50:11 entertaining and interesting and one of
50:13 the things i don't know you if you have
50:15 this uh
50:15 rainbow colored uh owl why don't you
50:18 have the owl yeah yes i always have the
50:22 owl with
50:23 me yeah oh great that that is
50:26 maybe one of the growth hacks because
50:28 this is like uh one of the
50:29 housekeeping mascot or like yeah
50:33 yeah so this is like uh like every time
50:36 i go to
50:37 the dvc channel i see this uh
50:40 this little guy is it a guy or a girl dv
50:44 yes it really is um i just love dv so
50:48 much
50:48 i mean actually when i was a kid i used
50:50 to make a lot of videos that i would
50:52 post on my social networks of just being
50:54 silly
50:55 and this feels like that i just get to
50:57 like goof off with this completely
50:59 ridiculous technicolor owl
51:01 you know i just like i wish i could be
51:03 in the room when they decided like we're
51:04 going to sell
51:05 this owl i just love it and i want
51:09 everybody to see this
51:11 but that could be one of the grow hacks
51:13 that you can share
51:14 next time somebody asks you okay just
51:16 bring the
51:18 the rainbow color towel or something
51:20 else something that
51:21 attracts people because this is like uh
51:24 it's on every video right
51:25 was that yeah without uh
51:29 oh i'm completely committed to featuring
51:31 dv in every video
51:32 i mean i also just want people to know
51:34 like this isn't that
51:36 serious you know it it's
51:39 i don't know like i i used to go to a
51:41 data visualization meetup group
51:43 back when we could meet in person and it
51:45 was held in a cupcake shop
51:47 it was this bright pink cupcake shop and
51:49 it was just the perfect kind of like
51:52 it's cool we don't all have to have like
51:54 we don't have to be
51:55 like hackers you know we can just be
51:59 people who are going to try this
52:01 together
52:03 and so i like comedy that way we don't
52:06 have a lot of time left
52:07 uh so let me check if we have questions
52:10 yeah we don't accept from uh angel who
52:14 was saying that
52:14 uh he wasn't a troll
52:18 sorry about that yeah so um
52:22 i um so what i'm also
52:25 interested about this uh that
52:28 you mentioned that you're going to be
52:30 teaching soon and uh
52:32 in your opinion how this is these two
52:35 things are related like being a
52:36 developer and being a good teacher
52:38 like uh does a debra always need to be a
52:41 good teacher
52:44 i think at some level yes but not in the
52:47 same sense of being able to put together
52:49 like
52:50 a classroom lecture and of course you
52:52 don't have to grade anybody
52:54 but you you do have to spot like where
52:57 are people struggling to learn something
52:59 you know what are what are the spots
53:01 that i really need to help them on
53:03 and honestly being like when i make
53:06 youtube videos one of the coolest things
53:07 about it was that like i would get
53:09 questions from students in other
53:11 countries and they would write and be
53:12 like hi i'm an undergrad
53:14 doing this like you know what should i
53:15 do um and you end up kind of advising a
53:18 lot of people
53:19 and that part is really sweet and really
53:22 rewarding
53:24 um you know it's it's cool um
53:27 and so that part i think is
53:30 a lot like teaching um of course
53:33 teaching comes with like a lot more you
53:35 know
53:35 you have to make a syllabus and you have
53:37 to grade you know all that and you have
53:39 to create a curriculum
53:40 but i kind of wanted that like i wanted
53:42 to make sure
53:44 like i think everybody who does data
53:46 science needs to know something about
53:48 like
53:48 the craft of it like how do you manage
53:51 developing
53:52 your code and your data you know and
53:55 i want to make sure that that's not just
53:57 the thing that data scientists learn
53:59 like after the fact on the job like i
54:01 want to be intentional about like what's
54:02 in the curriculum
54:04 and if you pay for a data science
54:06 master's what do you get like i want to
54:08 control that
54:09 you know and so that's kind of why i'm
54:11 i'm going back into a university is
54:13 because i want to help standardize this
54:15 a bit
54:16 um but where was i going honestly one of
54:20 the things i was most worried about was
54:21 losing the international audience
54:22 because i feel like actually as a devrel
54:24 you have students all over the world and
54:26 it's all free
54:27 like it's all accessible for them so one
54:30 of the things i made sure of when i
54:31 took the job was that i would maintain
54:33 like contain continue to have copyright
54:36 over all of my teaching materials so
54:37 that i could share them
54:39 because of i don't want to stop
54:40 providing materials
54:42 to students that happen to be outside of
54:44 the university
54:46 so you you plan to record the videos and
54:49 put them online
54:50 definitely some um i have found that
54:52 youtube is is a really good channel
54:55 and i like it a lot i'd also for me
54:58 like i don't have the same kind of like
55:00 i find it less
55:01 there's less toxicity as a creator there
55:04 um
55:04 and it's you know really fun interacting
55:06 with people and you know people wait for
55:08 your videos and you get regulars and
55:10 and that's really cool um so i'm
55:13 definitely planning on continuing to
55:15 have youtube
55:15 videos like you know if people are
55:17 asking a question in class a lot i'll
55:19 probably just make up a video explaining
55:21 it
55:21 put out like a three minute video you
55:23 know i i it's just a great reusable
55:26 resource for people
55:28 yeah that's that's great to hear that
55:29 you managed to convince the university
55:31 to allow you to do that
55:33 and i'm personally looking forward to
55:35 seeing those videos and i think we need
55:37 more of videos like that um and
55:40 especially we need
55:42 i get university we need more lectures
55:44 like that that prepare
55:45 students for real life because uh most
55:48 of the time what happens
55:49 like you said people just learn at work
55:52 but the university is supposed to
55:54 prepare them for work right
55:56 yeah it's it's definitely i mean like i
55:59 said i mean i
56:00 i was in school for like 10 years and i
56:03 still never had anybody really
56:05 teach me how to use git even though like
56:07 every lab
56:08 wrote code you know and
56:11 yeah it's i think they realize now that
56:14 there's a gap but like
56:16 i mean one of the worst things was that
56:17 everybody when i was doing my phd you'd
56:19 hear people say constantly like oh yeah
56:21 you'll be ready for industry
56:22 and then i got there and i just wasn't
56:24 [Laughter]
56:26 yeah i've heard that story so many times
56:28 and i was also the one who was
56:31 saying that story well except except phd
56:34 i was
56:34 saying masters but this is pretty common
56:37 uh
56:38 theme yeah thanks a lot for for coming
56:41 today
56:41 and share your experience with us do you
56:44 have any last words
56:46 where can i find you so last words yeah
56:49 you can follow me on twitter
56:50 or linkedin um you know we've got a
56:53 youtube channel um which we can probably
56:55 provide
56:56 a link for um and
56:59 basically i i hope that you know
57:04 i hope more people become devils
57:06 especially people
57:07 who have really different backgrounds
57:09 because of i just tend to find
57:11 that sometimes when you're an outsider
57:13 from somewhere it gives you a really
57:15 good perspective about what it's like to
57:17 learn and that can make you one of the
57:18 most effective teachers
57:20 and people who you know really
57:22 understand how to tell stories
57:24 how to make great graphics great videos
57:27 you know all of that like it's like
57:29 getting to be like your own little
57:31 video studio you know
57:34 it's it's it can be really creative and
57:37 really rewarding
57:38 and that is why it can be worth
57:41 you know all of the all the really
57:43 difficult parts too
57:45 um so i hope that this has been helpful
57:47 for you in figuring out if it might be
57:49 something
57:49 or if you're a company that is looking
57:51 to hire i hope it's helped clarify
57:54 you know some of the different parts of
57:56 devrel and how you know
57:58 it's it's actually got quite a few maybe
58:00 you know independent facets and
58:02 you know sometimes you'll find a unicorn
