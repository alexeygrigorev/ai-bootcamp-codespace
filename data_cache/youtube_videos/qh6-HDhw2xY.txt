0:58 notes
1:03 okay
1:05 i think i'm ready
1:07 are you ready
1:09 ready let's do it
1:12 okay
1:15 um
1:16 just one second
1:17 i thought i am ready but i have this
1:19 chat window that is opened
1:22 okay now it's good
1:24 so this week we'll talk about
1:25 transitioning to analytics and we have a
1:28 special guest today juan pablo juan
1:30 pablo was a math teacher who switched
1:32 careers and became an analytics engineer
1:35 he currently works at amazon and he also
1:37 mentors at the university of washington
1:39 where he helps students get their first
1:41 date role
1:42 welcome
1:44 thank you
1:46 thank you it's a pleasure to uh to be
1:48 invited to the data talks club
1:50 yeah thanks for for joining us so before
1:52 we go into our main topic of
1:54 transitioning to analytics to analytics
1:56 engineering let's start with your
1:58 background can you tell us about your
2:00 career journey so far
2:02 my career journey so far i'm sure
2:08 i started as a
2:10 mathematics graduate student uh my goal
2:13 was to become a math professor
2:16 that seems like a lifetime away
2:19 ago
2:20 and after that um
2:24 when i left my program uh i started
2:26 taking statistics courses i wanted to
2:29 get into data analytics
2:31 at the time let's be honest i was not
2:34 ready
2:35 and so
2:36 the easiest path
2:38 to a job
2:39 was math teaching and that's what i had
2:41 experience in
2:43 and it was
2:45 close to my original goal of being a
2:47 professor so i ended up being a math
2:48 teacher
2:50 and
2:53 after i think i was teaching the
2:56 intermediate value theorem for the fifth
2:58 time that i realized i cannot do this
3:01 much longer i need to make a change i
3:04 need to
3:06 get a job
3:08 in data analytics we can get later into
3:11 white data analytics
3:13 and i started working towards that
3:15 transition
3:17 my first role was at a consulting
3:19 company here in the seattle washington
3:21 area
3:23 my second role was with t-mobile
3:25 t-mobile was a client that's very common
3:27 in consulting where
3:29 the client coaches you or asks you to
3:31 join them full time
3:34 so i was in consulting for about a year
3:35 i was with t-mobile for
3:37 a little over two years
3:39 and then i've been with amazon for two
3:42 years and one month
3:44 and here i am uh i've been i've been
3:46 doing the mentoring part with the
3:48 university of washington
3:50 this is my fourth year
3:54 and
3:55 you you know we met online i've been
3:58 active on linkedin and twitter
4:01 for the past six months
4:05 yeah
4:06 thanks for advertising our data
4:08 engineering course so this tweet really
4:10 took off a lot of people saw the course
4:14 because of your tweets so thanks for
4:15 doing that
4:16 by my pleasure i saw that shared by
4:19 someone else
4:20 uh someone who i think is either based
4:23 in
4:24 england or
4:25 scotland uh and i clicked on the link on
4:28 the github right and that tweet didn't
4:30 get much traction and i opened the
4:32 link that's how i found out about data
4:34 talks
4:35 and i thought this is pure gold this is
4:38 a valuable learning resource a valuable
4:40 community and it deserves more attention
4:44 uh
4:45 you know people are always asking for
4:46 resources mainly for data science data
4:48 analytics
4:51 but i've been curious because i've been
4:53 around long enough to realize that there
4:55 aren't enough resources for data
4:56 engineering and so when i saw that one
4:58 it's like i i need to
5:01 share it so that it gets more visibility
5:03 hopefully people will join right away
5:05 but if not at least it's in the in their
5:08 radar
5:09 yeah thanks
5:11 you mentioned this intermediate value
5:12 theorem is it something from game theory
5:15 no intermediate value theorem should be
5:17 a calculus
5:19 intermediate value theorem
5:25 so you were teaching calculus
5:27 i was teaching uh yeah so i was teaching
5:29 calculus at in a high school it was a
5:32 private high school
5:33 and
5:34 i had also um
5:38 been a teaching assistant when i was a
5:40 graduate student and i always got the
5:42 same course calculus one
5:44 so i had done it four times in college
5:47 one time in high school and i said okay
5:50 i was at the board and something clicked
5:53 uh
5:54 i don't want to turn 50
5:56 and still do the mean value theorem for
5:59 the intermediate value theorem um
6:02 and so
6:04 yeah i something was planted in my mind
6:08 then
6:10 and i started doing more research i
6:11 started studying at night and yep and
6:14 you know it's it's been six years since
6:16 then
6:17 maybe a little more
6:18 you're probably quite good at uh taking
6:20 derivatives uh integrals and
6:23 like this chain rule stuff
6:26 yeah uh
6:27 to be honest i haven't done it in a
6:30 while but yes it's a matter of
6:32 uh you know re-reading um the rules well
6:36 the chain rule i can do by memory but uh
6:39 you know integration by parts i might
6:40 have to revisit the theorem and
6:45 do it again yeah
6:46 yeah when i was taking a deep learning
6:49 course
6:50 and uh like in deep learning you have
6:52 this propagation and you need to apply
6:55 this chain rule quite a lot and i was
6:57 having a hard time remembering like
6:59 especially doing back propagation for
7:02 this
7:05 batch normalization like this derivative
7:08 that's just mine like it was blowing my
7:10 mind but i guess for you it will be you
7:13 can do this with your eyes
7:14 closed uh
7:17 hopefully i like the mode of confidence
7:22 yeah but but when you think about the
7:24 chain rule i'm sure at some point
7:27 you must have seen it either either in
7:28 high school or or in university
7:32 and unless you go into math or
7:35 maybe statistics
7:37 you might not revisit it again and so
7:39 it's it's common that people forget yeah
7:45 funny that you bring that up when i was
7:46 a teacher sometimes students would ask
7:48 me but when will we need this
7:52 and i would try to politely change the
7:54 subject
7:57 well now you can say that uh for deep
7:59 learning
8:00 well at least for the theory part uh but
8:02 now with tensorflow you can just
8:05 do whatever you want with tensorflow and
8:07 it will take care of computing the
8:09 derivatives
8:10 so yeah maybe i'm not sure if it was
8:12 really needed
8:14 i mean
8:15 i probably can claim that at some point
8:17 of my life i understood how it works now
8:19 i don't again
8:24 so either a math teacher so you were
8:26 tired of
8:28 teaching intermediate value theorem for
8:30 the fifth time and then you went to
8:32 research right this is how it happened
8:34 no then i went to yeah yeah i can
8:37 would you like me to go about the
8:38 transition yeah i'm interested how
8:41 exactly you like from the point you
8:43 realized okay this is not for me i do
8:45 not want to turn 50 and still teach that
8:48 to the point when you got hired like how
8:50 did it actually look like
8:52 what
8:53 were you doing to
8:56 to basically go to the industry and
8:57 start working as a analytics engineer
9:01 yes absolutely i can i can touch on that
9:04 i so i was still teaching
9:08 i started
9:11 let me let me uh
9:12 take a couple steps back
9:14 when i was a graduate student in math i
9:17 was taking i was mainly taking math
9:19 courses but i knew
9:21 that i wanted to leave the program at
9:22 some at some point most likely after the
9:25 masters
9:26 and so i started taking courses in
9:29 the biostatistics and statistics
9:32 programs
9:34 that's how i was familiar with
9:36 hypothesis testing
9:38 um
9:41 linear statistical models
9:43 sas
9:45 statistical
9:47 software
9:48 and then some are programming
9:51 so i i it was in my radar and we're
9:54 talking about 2012 2013 when data
9:57 science
9:58 data analytics
10:01 were starting to
10:02 become popular terms
10:05 i had also seen some of my classmates
10:09 drop out of the program to join software
10:11 engineering bootcamps
10:14 so then let's fast forward to when i was
10:16 a teacher and i had decided
10:19 to leave the school
10:22 they offered me a to come back the next
10:24 year it was a private school so
10:26 you
10:27 you're basically contracted every year
10:29 no
10:30 and i declined the offer
10:33 and at night i would watch some videos
10:35 on youtube i would go through other
10:36 people's githubs i would try to get
10:39 enough information to strengthen my our
10:42 programming skills
10:45 uh
10:46 and to be to familiarize myself with
10:49 some um
10:51 uh let's say database packages in our
10:54 also some
10:56 machine learning packages how to use
10:58 them i didn't know at the time that i
11:02 needed to learn sql
11:06 and it's what i use most of the time now
11:09 and
11:11 i didn't know about tableau
11:13 most of the data is
11:15 that uh the visuals i was building were
11:18 using r
11:19 but it started right
11:21 i was lucky back then i was in the
11:23 middle of the country in the midwest and
11:25 so i moved
11:26 after my the the year ended i moved to
11:28 the west coast where the jobs are where
11:30 the tech money is in the united states
11:34 and
11:35 i actually moved back with my parents
11:38 and
11:40 i joined this uh a boot camp in the area
11:44 right
11:45 there were multiple boot camps
11:47 at the time
11:48 you know being a teacher or a former
11:50 teacher
11:51 i went for the cheapest boot camp and i
11:53 got the cheapest education
11:56 lesson learned
11:58 anyway and so would you do it
12:00 differently
12:01 if you were doing the speech today
12:03 could you go to not the cheapest one
12:06 yes i would go to another one with a
12:08 bigger network because it's ultimately
12:10 about the network uh but you know that's
12:13 how you learn and and so
12:16 i just have to live with it
12:18 i met some interesting people so i don't
12:21 fully regret it but i have to
12:22 acknowledge that i got what i paid for
12:27 there at least they gave me kind of a
12:29 road map uh made me aware of the things
12:31 that i didn't know
12:34 uh and it became a leader
12:38 yeah yeah sql and uh
12:41 tableau or power bi some some software
12:43 tool uh eventually they're going to make
12:46 you
12:46 build dashboards and
12:49 share them with the org
12:51 and
12:53 most companies would prefer to use a
12:56 software tool like tableau power bi
12:58 quick site
13:01 qlik sense
13:03 google data bootcamp was about analytics
13:06 right not about data science it was
13:07 about analytics but mainly analytics
13:09 yeah yeah
13:11 they advertised it as both but it was
13:13 mainly analytics and
13:16 i also
13:19 i don't know it seemed easier to get a
13:21 data and a like a data analyst job than
13:24 a data scientist job
13:25 particularly with no
13:28 internships or no
13:30 tangible experience
13:32 uh and to be honest at some point
13:36 the
13:37 the time you're looking for jobs or the
13:39 time you're searching grows longer and
13:42 you will take anything
13:47 and so yeah uh that bootcamp made me
13:49 aware of
13:50 my learning gaps
13:52 it also made me aware that
13:56 they cannot guarantee me a job i need to
13:58 go out and hunt i need to network i need
14:00 to meet people
14:03 and
14:04 i would do that right actually most of
14:07 the content that i share
14:10 online and most of what i share
14:13 in the
14:14 in the mentorship with the university of
14:16 washington or or outside of it
14:20 comes from that time
14:21 period in my life when
14:24 i was searching for a job and i wasn't
14:26 land in one it took me actually nine
14:29 months
14:31 yeah it was painful it was frustrating
14:34 you didn't have any ink up during this
14:36 time right because you quit your
14:38 math job right and
14:40 you also were taking boot camp and it
14:42 wasn't free right so you needed to do
14:44 you to use your to leave on your savings
14:47 i i did i also it's something i don't
14:50 share on on my tweets but i
14:53 did two things i
14:55 worked at a restaurant okay
14:58 uh and once i started getting interviews
15:02 uh
15:03 working at the restaurant within a with
15:05 a fixed schedule
15:07 uh was not doing it for me so
15:10 i started driving
15:12 uber
15:14 i was an uber driver for some time
15:16 because it gave me the flexibility
15:18 to you know
15:20 this
15:21 this is uh
15:22 why didn't do you not share it this is
15:25 like from uber driver to
15:27 analytics engineer it sounds much cooler
15:30 than
15:30 from math teacher
15:32 it does sound
15:34 it does sound much cooler but the
15:36 reality is
15:37 if i were to share from uber drivers by
15:39 analytics engineer it makes it sound
15:41 like i have i had no education and in
15:45 the realities that i did i just needed
15:47 to
15:48 express myself on the interview yeah
15:50 yeah so i don't want to be misleading
15:52 but yes it does sound cool
15:57 and yeah i tried multiple things and i
15:59 know that you reached out to me about
16:01 one specific tweet where i say like
16:02 eight tips and alternatives on how to
16:05 land a data analytics job i i tried many
16:09 of those i tried many of those
16:11 but but moving back to the story how did
16:13 i eventually find a job
16:16 back back in 2016 this was 2016.
16:21 people would network online but they
16:22 would also network in person
16:24 uh
16:26 luckily i was in the seattle area and
16:29 there was in a neighborhood called
16:31 pioneer square
16:34 they had
16:35 um
16:39 they had a venue where they host uh
16:41 events uh like meetup events like if you
16:45 go to meetup.com you would get some
16:46 python events there some software
16:48 development events some data science
16:50 events
16:51 and i went to that
16:54 event place
16:56 probably 10 or 15 times during my search
16:59 it was one during one of those times
17:01 that i met this uh this man
17:06 who was hiring well
17:08 he had a consulting startup
17:11 and i met him there we chatted i shared
17:14 my resume with him
17:18 eventually he would hire me but at the
17:20 beginning he ghosted me
17:23 and i understand many people ghosted me
17:27 then through someone else
17:30 he received my wrestling for the second
17:32 time
17:33 when he got it for the second time after
17:37 a month or two
17:39 maybe three
17:41 he reached out to me
17:43 and
17:45 basically said i guess you're still
17:46 looking and you're not going to give up
17:48 so i want to interview you and then i
17:50 got the job
17:51 yeah that's such a nice story i mean of
17:54 course also i imagine it wasn't easy for
17:56 you it was quite difficult because you
17:58 needed to
17:59 drive uber and then
18:01 it's imagine that it's quite frustrating
18:04 that
18:05 you know applied and then not hearing
18:07 back
18:08 so that's uh
18:09 quite admirable that you did this for
18:11 nine months but eventually because of
18:13 the network as i understood uh you
18:16 managed to so first of all you talk to
18:19 this person and then you talk through
18:20 somebody else and this is the power of
18:23 network right you wouldn't be able to do
18:24 this
18:25 just by clicking
18:27 a button on the website right
18:29 correct correct uh clicking submit uh
18:34 works for some it didn't work for me at
18:36 the time it works for me now my labels
18:39 are different right after working for
18:41 amazon
18:42 uh
18:44 people will give you more opportunities
18:45 than
18:46 when you're
18:48 let's say a high school teacher or just
18:49 a college graduate without any
18:51 experience
18:53 so when you're in those situations you
18:55 have to hustle
18:56 excuse me
18:57 it's like social proof or i don't know
18:59 how do you call it but uh
19:02 people see okay this person works at
19:03 amazon they must be quite good right
19:06 let's interview them
19:08 while when they see this is a math
19:10 teacher
19:10 and they have 100 other math teachers
19:14 and okay how do we select the math
19:16 teacher we want to interview now
19:19 is it is it the case like uh with you
19:21 from the boot camp
19:23 i imagine that there were many people
19:25 from different backgrounds and then it
19:27 was quite difficult i guess to set
19:29 yourself apart from
19:31 from
19:32 others like you
19:34 so there were 10 of us and
19:38 six or seven went back to doing what
19:40 they were doing before
19:42 okay
19:43 i am friends with a couple of people who
19:47 are who were in the boot camp one is in
19:49 data science i should say two are in
19:51 data science one is in
19:53 uh
19:55 like software sales then everybody else
19:57 went back to doing what they were doing
20:01 do you think is it because it was the
20:03 cheapest boot camp or because of other
20:05 reasons
20:07 market was tough
20:09 tough back then
20:11 for
20:12 people without experience
20:17 though i think the market is tough for
20:18 people without experience
20:20 the market is just tough and
20:23 you have to if you're in that
20:26 you know if you're in that group you
20:28 have to hustle you have to look for
20:31 alternative ways
20:32 on how to get
20:34 in front of a hiring manager or hiring
20:37 community committee
20:39 you have to
20:41 think outside the box
20:42 because
20:43 if you
20:44 basically you have to look for the
20:46 uncrowded doors because if you look for
20:48 the crowded doors let's say they click
20:50 submit
20:51 or even go to a job fair
20:54 it's going to be tough
20:56 it's going to be tough because
20:59 in those crowded doors
21:01 you have the top applicants coming in
21:04 yeah
21:06 and what are these alternative ways that
21:08 are less crowded so
21:10 click and apply is a crowded way like
21:12 that yes a lot of people who do this job
21:15 fairs is also not
21:17 the best approach right so what are the
21:20 the better alternatives you mentioned i
21:23 guess this is one of them
21:25 is there anything else
21:26 yeah i can tell you
21:28 um yeah because i have this tweet in
21:31 front of me now um
21:33 so first
21:34 i think if you're on linkedin right if
21:36 you're on linkedin
21:38 that's a big plus
21:40 but being on linkedin is just not enough
21:43 right you have to
21:44 or i shouldn't say you have to it helps
21:47 if
21:48 you're active on linkedin
21:50 i believe
21:52 that most people use linkedin the wrong
21:54 way
21:55 what do i mean by that
22:01 people can do more than just liking
22:04 posts
22:05 people can do more than
22:10 re-sharing
22:11 an article and not writing anything
22:13 about it
22:15 people can do more than sharing
22:17 a pdf of somebody someone else's work
22:21 we can do more than just saying
22:25 uh
22:26 my company just went public
22:28 i believe that everyone has something to
22:30 say
22:32 i believe that everyone has a journey
22:35 and
22:37 people are out there out there out there
22:40 dying to hear what you have to say
22:43 it might not get traction the first few
22:45 times
22:46 but you'll eventually find your voice
22:49 and you'll find your tribe your people
22:53 so linkedin must be up to date
22:55 uh
22:56 and
22:58 be active there if you are shy
23:02 initially it's fine
23:03 but you can comment on other people's
23:05 posts and something beyond
23:09 i like this or i agree with you
23:11 [Music]
23:14 ask questions add value don't pick
23:16 fights
23:17 you know yeah
23:20 and and that'll go a long way why
23:22 because it brings
23:24 visibility to your profile okay and if
23:26 your profile makes it obvious that
23:29 you are
23:31 looking for work
23:33 and that you're serious about it and
23:36 perhaps you have a portfolio you can you
23:38 can make it easy for people to land on
23:40 that portfolio then
23:42 the conversation is different
23:45 um
23:47 another one is your resume should always
23:49 be up to date
23:50 and if you have a link to it
23:53 share it you know it's
23:55 if someone
23:56 let's say you're looking for work and
23:58 someone approaches you and this they say
24:00 oh yeah can i take a look at your resume
24:02 and you have you tell them oh wait but i
24:04 have to go back home and get on my
24:05 laptop so that i can i can share it with
24:08 you via email
24:10 i mean you just lost you just lost an
24:12 opportunity
24:14 it should be within it should be okay
24:16 let me just
24:18 uh send it to you via linkedin on my
24:20 phone
24:21 right now or a qr code or a link your
24:23 code exactly
24:25 yeah so yeah that's another thing a
24:28 third one is to have a portfolio it
24:30 doesn't have to be
24:33 the most advanced portfolio but it
24:35 should be a link where people can see
24:37 what you've done especially when you're
24:38 trying to land that first job
24:41 i
24:42 use
24:43 since i i mainly was familiar with our
24:46 programming i used the website
24:49 rpubs.com
24:51 uh in fact
24:53 you invited me to this and i went to see
24:55 it and i can see the sub some of the
24:57 posts are up but when i click on them
24:59 they don't load anymore because it's
25:01 been six years
25:02 but that's what i used uh
25:05 software what did they write with our i
25:07 think i remember that there is armor
25:09 ground language so in rstudio you can
25:11 just quickly type something click a
25:13 button and then it gets published right
25:15 yes it'll create an
25:16 our markdown file and it'll push it
25:21 yeah i remember doing this as well
25:24 when i was still learning r
25:28 nice thing
25:29 yeah okay so you used that for your
25:31 portfolio and then i guess in rpops you
25:32 had all your
25:34 uh all the projects you did in right
25:37 correct correct uh yeah i had my
25:40 projects in our mostly uh data wrangling
25:43 exploratory data analysis
25:46 data
25:47 visualization
25:49 i used i don't know which
25:51 library it was but it incorporated
25:53 google maps
25:55 so it was it was useful in case you
25:58 wanted to display um
26:03 maps
26:04 maps yeah or heat maps or
26:06 yeah local locations mainly and
26:11 i had some
26:13 machine learning very basic just some
26:14 basic classification and regression
26:16 models the idea was for people
26:19 to see that i was serious enough
26:22 and that i had something up uh to be
26:24 honest
26:26 it's like serious enough is uh
26:29 how many projects do you need to have in
26:31 your portfolio to say that you're
26:33 serious
26:34 one two three five
26:38 to be honest i think three is good
26:39 enough um
26:43 we're looking we're talking about entry
26:44 level roles
26:48 my first role didn't pay much
26:50 and so
26:52 i think it was good enough i actually
26:54 had maybe seven or eight but
26:56 uh
26:57 i i often get the question you know how
26:59 many projects should i have
27:01 uh should i wait until i have that magic
27:03 number to share it no no no i i will
27:06 always say this any portfolio is better
27:08 than no portfolio so even if you're
27:11 anything like one okay yes yeah just put
27:14 it up there
27:15 share it
27:16 um socialize your work
27:19 share it on linkedin share it on
27:21 twitter share it on hash notes share it
27:24 on medium share it just share it
27:27 let let people see it
27:30 some will think
27:31 it's not good enough some will laugh at
27:34 it
27:35 they're not gonna laugh on it laugh at
27:37 it online they're not gonna you know
27:39 share how disappointed they are in you
27:41 but if someone finds it interesting
27:44 if someone
27:46 clicks on it and eventually lands on
27:48 your linkedin page
27:51 uh maybe connects with you or reaches
27:53 out to you
27:54 it's it's it's a win
27:57 yeah
27:58 you know if you're looking for a job
28:01 you can have 100 rejections but if you
28:03 get one if you get hired by one company
28:06 then
28:07 you made it
28:09 you just need only one successful
28:10 application right
28:12 yes that's it and you're
28:14 in and uh
28:17 yeah so when you
28:18 imagine that let's say you're on a meet
28:20 up and you want to
28:23 how to say make a move you know you see
28:25 somebody and you want to
28:27 say hey i'm looking for a job how do you
28:30 do this
28:31 uh yeah yeah so i would go to these
28:34 meetups and um i mean initially i was
28:37 excited about
28:38 the topics presented
28:41 but after two or three meetups i
28:43 realized okay well i'm here to get a job
28:46 and initially i would talk to the
28:48 presenters
28:49 which were
28:51 let's say people in their 20s maybe
28:53 early 30s
28:56 and quickly i started realizing okay
28:58 well they are
28:59 junior or intermediate data scientists
29:03 i need to talk to the managers
29:06 and so at the time
29:08 my strategy was to
29:10 sit in the back of the room so that i
29:12 can scan everyone in the room
29:15 and
29:16 i picked out people who looked a bit
29:18 older
29:22 40
29:23 and up
29:25 and
29:26 typically at the end of the the meetup
29:29 uh or at the beginning
29:32 there was um
29:34 you know a networking event right where
29:36 they were giving out some food and
29:38 sometimes they were giving out alcoholic
29:40 drinks
29:42 i actually never mentioned this but
29:44 i didn't mention this earlier i i've
29:46 worked in restaurants throughout my
29:47 undergrad career and uh and my parents
29:50 had restaurants when i was growing up in
29:52 latin america
29:53 and so that environment was always
29:56 familiar to me
29:57 and so i would just
30:00 approach them and say hello how are you
30:01 my name is jp jpc is here for most
30:04 americans to pronounce
30:06 or to say
30:07 and i would introduce myself uh and i
30:10 would ask them who they are and what
30:11 they do and you know i wouldn't tell
30:13 them that i needed a job i would try to
30:16 connect with them and be their friend
30:18 and so at some point the question will
30:19 arise
30:20 right
30:22 or i say it doesn't arise from them
30:24 you'll say hey by the way uh
30:26 i'm looking for a data scientist or a
30:28 data analyst role uh my background is in
30:31 mathematics i used to be in education
30:34 uh i've been uh you know creating some
30:37 i've been
30:39 creating some small projects
30:41 and uh would you happen to know who's
30:43 hiring
30:45 yeah and so then the conversation starts
30:47 right if they don't want to help uh
30:48 they're not going to say no but they'll
30:50 tell you they don't know anyone but if
30:52 they do
30:53 then
30:54 they'll at least connect with you on
30:56 linkedin right and they might share your
30:57 profile with someone else yeah okay so
31:00 how many such
31:02 um i'll say chats or how many people you
31:05 needed to talk to to find that one who
31:08 eventually helped you to get a job
31:11 oh like tens i don't know
31:13 yeah maybe like
31:15 30 40 people uh
31:18 some people didn't they were not hiring
31:20 some people were actually just curious
31:22 about
31:23 data talks or software engineering but
31:25 they're not in the field maybe they're
31:27 in insurance they're actually
31:28 considering making the switch
31:31 so yeah eventually i met this person
31:34 and yeah he was he was the one who hired
31:36 me and helped you yeah
31:38 okay so if i summarize this look for
31:41 people who look like managers not
31:43 juniors right and then uh
31:46 talk to them and then
31:48 just say oh by the way i'm looking for a
31:50 job
31:53 so again i don't know if this will work
31:55 for everyone it just worked for me and i
31:57 can only share my experience
32:01 then in that tweet that we you mentioned
32:03 so that tweet i think you have it pinned
32:06 so the tweet says getting your first job
32:08 in data analytics isn't always easy
32:11 blind applications don't work for
32:13 everyone sometimes they only lead to
32:15 rejections these eight tips and
32:17 alternatives can help you land your
32:19 first data analytic jobs right so we
32:21 talked about linkedin we talked about
32:24 did we talk about everything or there is
32:26 something that we can talk about we
32:28 talked about linkedin talked about
32:29 having your resume in handy talk about a
32:31 portfolio uh
32:33 and i can i would love to talk about the
32:35 rest if that's okay yeah but let's do
32:37 that
32:38 yeah yeah um uh i have a number four
32:40 reach out to recruiters for hiring
32:42 managers uh in my desperation i was
32:45 actually
32:47 i crafted a message
32:50 and
32:53 also in my desperation i did some free
32:55 code camp web development courses and so
32:58 i also had created like my own
33:01 website
33:02 back then i have a new one now with a
33:04 website builder but back then i shared i
33:07 crafted this message and i told them
33:08 that you know i was a data analyst with
33:10 some web development background and i
33:12 would reach out
33:13 to recruiters and hire managers or what
33:16 i thought were hiring managers in
33:18 on linkedin right i sent maybe i don't
33:20 know
33:21 200 of such messages i got about 5
33:24 replies
33:28 you should have done an a b test maybe
33:32 actually one led to an opportunity
33:36 but then i also had the opportunity from
33:38 the
33:40 from from the meetup and so i chose that
33:42 one
33:44 no so yeah you actually had two offers
33:46 right
33:46 yeah uh but see
33:49 the one for the meetup was a full-time
33:50 roll the other one was uh
33:54 like a temporary trial period and so
33:57 yeah i ended up going for that at least
33:59 something right
34:00 yes no no yeah absolutely and i will i
34:02 will talk about that uh in just a few
34:04 moments
34:06 number five consider contract and
34:08 temporals
34:10 i uh i have met
34:12 multiple aspiring data scientists and
34:14 analysts where they are looking for
34:16 their ideal company
34:19 and the ideal company could be amazon
34:22 could be facebook
34:24 and they will
34:25 not
34:27 consider
34:28 a contract role that pays maybe half but
34:32 will give them the experience and so
34:35 they will sometimes turn down
34:38 you know these these opportunities or
34:40 won't even look at them
34:42 and they'll continue looking at the big
34:43 companies and then the months pass
34:46 and they still have nothing
34:48 not they have no job so no money and
34:51 they have no experience
34:53 so i would consider contract rolls
34:55 uh that's actually how
34:57 um
34:58 you know many people get started
35:01 uh another one is
35:03 uh
35:04 place to find such roles
35:06 so to find contract roles uh
35:09 dice.com in the us is the the best place
35:12 so
35:13 dice is enrolling the dice
35:16 and to be honest if you want to stand
35:18 from the crowd sometimes the recruiters
35:20 on dice so let's say you click on a job
35:22 posting you'll see
35:24 the recruiter john smith
35:27 and many times they'll post their number
35:30 just call them
35:32 yeah just call them ask them uh
35:35 i ask
35:36 sometimes i'm curious right i want to
35:38 know what it's like so i'll do it like
35:40 who's the client most of the time they
35:42 won't share that
35:44 how long is the contract
35:46 and
35:48 what's the hour you pay
35:50 okay
35:51 and so
35:53 if you you know someone is interested in
35:55 contract rolls or considering them you
35:57 know if they tell you they pay fifty
35:59 dollars an hour
36:01 uh you just multiply that by two that's
36:02 100k a year
36:04 so that's a quick question
36:05 um
36:07 number six about
36:10 what
36:11 places like upwork and uh fever and so
36:15 there
36:16 um i think they are also
36:19 slightly less long-term positions but uh
36:23 typically i see that there are
36:24 freelancers there who are doing data
36:26 analytics and then somebody who maybe
36:28 wants to
36:29 get a report or something they maybe go
36:32 to upwork and find people there do you
36:35 think it's a good place do you have any
36:37 experience with this or maybe you know
36:38 somebody who used it to get experience
36:41 uh i know someone who has used it
36:44 my
36:46 my take on it from as an outsider
36:48 because i use fiverr for for other
36:50 things uh for proofreading for
36:53 um
36:54 for translations
36:56 so you used it as a client okay as a
36:59 client yes never as a
37:01 service provider
37:04 my take on it
37:06 as a client
37:07 is that if you live let's say in the
37:10 united states or canada or even western
37:13 western europe
37:14 then you are the most expensive by
37:17 default
37:18 and so you are competing with uh people
37:21 who are in in other countries who
37:24 who can offer more competitive pricing
37:27 and so that that puts you at a
37:28 disadvantage
37:30 okay yeah and dice is uh
37:32 it focuses on north america right i i
37:36 think it focuses
37:38 hmm
37:39 that's a good question i i think it does
37:41 it definitely focuses on north america i
37:43 don't know if they also are available
37:45 outside of north america
37:47 but
37:49 dice looks for contract and temp roles
37:51 in your market where you might where you
37:53 need to be in the mark in your market in
37:55 the in the geographical in location uh
37:59 where the job is right if not in the
38:01 same city at least
38:04 in the same in the same country
38:06 okay yeah now let's go to number six
38:10 yeah uh
38:12 i hear a lot
38:14 i don't have enough experience and i
38:16 don't know how to get it
38:18 uh
38:20 you can help a non-profit with a project
38:23 it might not be the ideal project
38:26 but
38:26 it is a project that
38:31 is helping an organization so it's real
38:33 you know it's a
38:35 it's a real i don't want to say business
38:37 case because it's non-profit but it's a
38:39 real world
38:41 problem that needs to be solved and so
38:43 that's an opportunity you can either
38:45 reach out directly to them
38:46 or i shared in the tweet there's a
38:49 website catch a fire
38:52 it's a platform that will connect you
38:54 with non-profits who need technical work
38:57 yeah and so that's something that you
39:00 know you you help them out and then you
39:02 can discuss
39:03 is it okay if i share this with um if i
39:08 put this on my portfolio i will mask the
39:10 numbers but i want to
39:12 um
39:13 you know share that i've done something
39:14 for
39:16 for a company and then you can list on
39:18 your resume that you were let's say a
39:20 data analyst consultant for three months
39:24 and that at least in my eyes is real
39:26 world experience
39:29 yeah so that's uh
39:31 that's an alternative
39:33 uh you know it's it's very different
39:35 from just click and submit
39:39 and number seven create your own
39:41 internship so this is what i did with
39:43 the messages right when i got offered
39:45 that uh the temporary job or temporary
39:49 yeah probation period
39:51 where
39:52 you reach out to someone typically a
39:54 small or medium company right you're not
39:56 going to reach out to google and try to
39:57 pitch this to them but uh but a small
39:59 company will be
40:02 open to listening
40:04 and so you reach out to them you
40:05 introduce yourself you introduce your
40:07 pro your portfolio
40:09 what you bring to the table how you can
40:11 add value to them
40:12 briefly be concise
40:14 and then
40:15 you say
40:16 i'm willing to work for you for two or
40:18 three months for
40:22 you know an hourly amount
40:24 typically something that is attractive
40:26 to them a lot cheaper than
40:28 uh you know a full-timer
40:31 and after that three-month period
40:34 you can decide
40:36 to hire me or not
40:38 now the catch here is for the
40:41 uh
40:42 the good thing is that
40:44 if they give you a job great you have a
40:46 job but even if they don't you have
40:48 three months of experience
40:50 and during those three months you will
40:53 prove yourself but you will also save
40:55 some time for applying to other places
40:58 because now
40:59 you are
41:01 a data analyst right
41:03 sure you're in a three-month probation
41:04 period but uh
41:07 i don't think anybody needs to know that
41:09 or if you want to write intern or temp
41:11 you know you can you can spin it in any
41:13 way you want
41:14 but the experience you have
41:17 so this the 200 messages that you
41:20 mentioned
41:21 they were about that so you this is what
41:23 you wrote you said that
41:25 this is me this is what the kind of work
41:27 i'm looking for
41:28 would you consider myself me for three
41:31 months internship right this is this was
41:34 the message you sent
41:35 yes i said uh this is just me this is my
41:37 work uh this is how i can add value to
41:39 your company
41:41 so make it make it about that
41:43 okay
41:44 it has to be personalized right so
41:46 probably there was a line in this
41:47 message that you would
41:49 change for every company or would you
41:51 just copy and paste i would just copy
41:53 and paste i would copy and paste uh
41:55 so i
41:56 looked for
41:58 uh
41:59 small or medium-sized marketing agencies
42:02 who do still need some analytics work
42:04 and potentially some web development
42:06 work and so i targeted them
42:08 and i targeted
42:09 area uh some in my area i targeted also
42:13 in cities where i had lived uh because
42:17 you know i i didn't go to school here in
42:19 seattle washington i went to school in
42:21 iowa and so
42:23 my degree you know i would if i send a
42:25 message in iowa i would say i'm an iowa
42:28 grad so that okay
42:30 she's one of us right
42:33 yeah
42:34 yeah to be honest i was so desperate
42:36 that i was trying multiple things
42:40 yeah well it worked at the end right you
42:42 said that it was a an opportunity at the
42:44 end so yes there was an opportunity that
42:47 uh
42:48 that they offered me i think it was
42:50 twenty dollars an hour which
42:52 you know for for a tech role in the
42:53 united states in seattle is peanuts
42:57 i think today starbucks offers 20 an
42:59 hour to be a barista so
43:02 but you cannot sell the experience later
43:05 um so being a barista you get the same
43:08 kind of money right but this is not
43:09 something you put on your cv when you
43:11 look for a job right but this is even
43:13 though it pays 20 dollars
43:15 it goes to your cv and then
43:17 it's you can sell it to the next company
43:20 it's a it's a long-term investment and
43:23 i don't even know if an investment
43:24 because you're actually making money off
43:26 of it yeah uh
43:28 and the last one is network network
43:29 network right put yourself out there uh
43:32 reach out to friends family um
43:37 alumni
43:38 uh in your in your network if you went
43:41 to a specific school
43:43 uh go to virtual meetups
43:46 join specific groups
43:48 um on
43:50 linkedin there's also slack i'm sure i'm
43:53 sure that there are many that i
43:55 i don't take advantage of or i don't i
43:57 don't use myself
43:59 but uh
44:01 you know
44:01 they're out there right i believe even
44:04 facebook has groups on yeah i think
44:06 that's software engineering
44:09 yeah so
44:13 try them try them out right see what
44:14 works for you and don't give up after
44:16 the first message
44:18 because no one will offer you something
44:20 on the first message it takes time
44:23 200 messages right
44:26 you have to keep popping up too right
44:28 you have to like on twitter you have to
44:30 keep popping up for people to say
44:33 okay i've seen this person 10 times i'm
44:36 gonna click on it now
44:40 i heard this overwhelm the algorithm so
44:43 basically like if you start posting a
44:45 lot on twitter then twitter will show
44:48 your face your messages to others
44:50 right so eventually you just need to
44:53 keep
44:54 pushing
44:55 yup
44:56 okay
44:57 one thing i wanted to ask you so you
45:00 mentioned that the first is
45:02 your personal website if your site you
45:04 did it yourself because you were taking
45:06 some courses on free code comp
45:08 but the course you have the website you
45:10 have right now
45:12 you create it using a website builder
45:14 what is the builder
45:16 what is it
45:25 it's like no code site builder
45:27 yeah it's a no code uh site builder and
45:30 it might be based out of lithuania
45:34 yeah i am very pleased with them i've
45:37 reached out to them on on twitter
45:39 multiple times um
45:41 for tweaking of my website and it's very
45:44 helpful really nice clean and
45:48 responsive good design so
45:50 i guess for somebody who is looking for
45:53 um a place to host their portfolio
45:56 this looks like a good option right
45:59 i would say so yeah i am pleased with
46:01 them and
46:03 yeah if you go to my twitter you can
46:05 find it and you can click on it yeah
46:08 it costs some money does it
46:10 it does it does uh
46:12 it was a bit more competitive in terms
46:15 of pricing than
46:16 using
46:18 the paid version of wordpress and also
46:21 squarespace
46:23 and
46:26 i don't know if it's the nerd in me but
46:28 i like the idea of trying something new
46:30 knowing that the company is uh
46:34 let's say in
46:36 what part is that that's north central
46:38 europe lithuania
46:40 uh and they're trying
46:43 okay and they're competing with uh you
46:46 know
46:47 the big the big guns here in the us so
46:49 um i thought okay well i'm gonna i'm
46:51 gonna support this um
46:53 this venture
46:54 yeah for people who are not ready to
46:58 invest in this because i imagine i would
47:00 say if you have to
47:02 drive an uber to actually survive then
47:04 maybe you are not ready to yet to pay
47:07 for a website right
47:08 what are the good alternatives that are
47:10 free
47:12 uh well github is one good alternative i
47:15 believe that even wordpress has
47:17 a
47:18 free tier
47:19 it'll just say wordpress in the url
47:22 instead of just your name or the website
47:24 name
47:26 um
47:29 i mean our pubs is another one
47:32 you can always host your work on github
47:34 and
47:36 let's say right just have a link uh
47:40 but you can use hash node
47:42 to
47:43 basically describe your project
47:46 and at the very top somewhere in the
47:48 middle and at the end you say link to
47:50 code
47:52 yeah
47:53 i mean
47:54 you have to get creative if you don't
47:56 have the money you have to get creative
47:58 i
47:59 i am in a position now in my life where
48:02 i'm okay paying for hosting and i'm okay
48:04 paying for a website builder to get
48:07 a clean url and a clean look on my
48:10 website
48:12 yeah
48:13 the most important thing right if you're
48:15 looking for a job
48:16 like a github page would do
48:19 yes a github page would do but one thing
48:21 i tell people is you have to make it
48:24 easy
48:25 for
48:27 those who land on your page to know
48:30 where's what
48:31 right and what means what it's okay to
48:34 be redundant and over explain
48:37 or over over describe
48:40 but it's it's much better than having no
48:42 description right
48:44 no one
48:47 most people don't just want to look at
48:48 the code right you need to have some
48:49 comments you need to know what it
48:51 accomplishes
48:52 uh yeah yeah i imagine that uh
48:56 if i look at the cv of somebody of a
48:59 candidate when i hire only in rare
49:02 occasions i would actually go and check
49:04 the code
49:05 because
49:07 there is only i have only limited time
49:09 and many candidates right i don't have
49:11 time to check the code of every
49:12 candidate
49:14 maybe
49:15 at the end of the final but not at the
49:16 beginning definitely not before the
49:18 first interview
49:20 so having a good description of your
49:22 project for each project in github i
49:24 think it's very helpful to quickly get
49:26 an idea what the project is about
49:28 instead of just trying to figure out
49:30 this from the code
49:31 so yeah i agree
49:34 um yeah we have a few questions so the
49:36 first question is i currently work as a
49:38 math teacher and i want to switch career
49:41 to data field sounds familiar right can
49:44 you give tips or tricks to do it i think
49:46 you already gave quite a few suggestions
49:48 this question was asked before we
49:51 covered that part
49:52 now yeah but the question continues is
49:55 what should i learn first
49:56 do you have any suggestions for
49:58 for that maybe
50:00 i think you would go with eco right or
50:02 something else
50:03 i i would say definitely sql
50:06 uh start with sql start with a
50:10 software visualization tool
50:14 and
50:14 [Music]
50:15 one programming language uh
50:19 so math being a math person i was always
50:22 attracted to r
50:23 but
50:24 if someone comes to me and says are
50:26 python i would suggest to learn python
50:28 over art
50:30 it's more marketable in my opinion
50:32 um
50:34 and i don't know if you can share this
50:36 with
50:37 um
50:38 the listeners or the viewers but
50:41 i i just share this uh
50:44 tweet twitter url yeah uh that is
50:48 yeah that is the thread that i created
50:51 or that i wrote
50:52 um describing how i would go about
50:56 transitioning from teacher to to
51:00 data analyst or analytics engineer
51:02 business intelligence engineer
51:05 and uh
51:06 in in usual twitter mode it's uh
51:11 it's it screams at you right it says i
51:13 was a broke teacher but
51:15 that's just to get people to click on it
51:17 but uh there's actually useful
51:18 information there
51:21 okay
51:22 so sql python some visualization to
51:27 something else
51:31 that's probably enough right for the
51:32 start and then just use the skills to
51:34 build the portfolio yeah use your skills
51:36 to build portfolio uh look at use cases
51:39 uh look at uh
51:41 business analytics or
51:43 data science use cases to familiarize
51:45 with what type of
51:47 problems will come to you
51:50 if you can
51:52 also look up
51:55 data analyst interview because it's good
51:57 to familiarize yourself with with the
51:59 interview process
52:01 being a teacher i don't know who this
52:03 person is
52:04 and perhaps that they're different than
52:06 me but
52:07 sometimes teachers sometimes uh
52:10 stem students like
52:12 math physics stats computer science
52:14 students think that they should know
52:16 everything before going into an
52:18 interview or they think that they should
52:20 be good enough
52:21 i'm just going to study the fundamental
52:24 fundamentals and then i'm going to crack
52:26 the interview well i think you should
52:27 familiarize yourself with how the
52:29 interview is structured because there
52:31 are some
52:32 um
52:34 uh
52:35 that you know there are some
52:36 commonalities across multiple companies
52:38 typically the big companies set the pace
52:41 and then everybody else kind of follows
52:43 or most smaller companies follow
52:46 yeah
52:48 and by the way what do you do now
52:50 like you work at amazon what are you
52:51 doing yeah i'm at amazon i'm a uh
52:55 i'm in advertising i'm in a
52:58 bi and data engineering team uh
53:01 so it's advertising operations so we'll
53:05 connect well we'll consume uh data from
53:08 upstream teams uh and then make it
53:10 available to
53:11 [Music]
53:12 uh a group of
53:15 troubleshooting consultants uh across
53:17 about
53:18 nine different countries uh so it's a
53:20 lot of
53:21 um
53:22 ingesting data building pipelines adding
53:24 business logic and eventually creating
53:27 um
53:29 dashboards for for reporting or for
53:32 to accelerate the troubleshooting
53:34 process
53:35 so this is uh what we would call this
53:38 data analytics engineer right so this is
53:43 amazon actually calls it business
53:44 intelligence engineer so it really
53:47 i've come to learn that it really it
53:49 depends on like the name of the company
53:50 i know that apple calls it analytics
53:52 engineer
53:53 uh netflix does too
53:55 and many of the new startups are calling
53:57 it analytics engineering yeah
54:00 yeah and the first job you got
54:03 when you actually landed that job was it
54:05 an analyst job or analytics engineering
54:08 job so the first job that i got was
54:10 actually the title was data scientist uh
54:13 but most of the work that i was doing
54:15 was um
54:18 writing sql and building dashboards
54:21 yeah so this is what the typical
54:23 analytics engineer does
54:25 today
54:26 i would say that's like typically what
54:28 uh because i wasn't because back then my
54:30 first job i was not building any
54:32 pipelines right and so i think
54:34 the best way to describe it is data
54:36 analyst or data analyst consultant
54:41 i spent quite a bit i mean i should say
54:44 most of the time i was writing sql
54:47 some are
54:48 but mostly sql and then tableau
54:53 i personally don't use tableau anymore
54:55 since i work at amazon i use
54:57 aws or amazon web services quicksite
55:00 which is amazon's internal
55:03 software
55:04 database or database software
55:07 i've gotten quite good at that actually
55:10 i'm sad that
55:12 not more people that not more people use
55:14 it because
55:16 i would love to to bounce ideas on how
55:19 to design dashboards with them
55:22 i guess the main concepts of uh
55:24 visualization they still apply to
55:26 tableau power bi or whatever to use
55:28 right
55:30 they do they do a quick sign is a bit
55:32 it's younger so it could feel
55:34 a bit more clunky
55:36 at first
55:37 um
55:38 and so yeah i'm always curious to to see
55:43 visually pleasing quick side dashboards
55:47 so what was the best suggestion for you
55:50 when you started that helped you more
55:52 than others
55:56 ah
55:58 just worked best for you
56:00 you showing
56:02 and something that still works is you
56:04 have to
56:05 keep showing up
56:08 i think showing up is
56:10 50 of the battle
56:12 right
56:13 uh i think technical skills
56:15 for me
56:16 50 like half of the success rate
56:19 yes you have to you have to be there
56:22 all the time you have to keep showing up
56:24 there will be people who
56:26 for example i'm not very technical i'm
56:28 not the most technical person in most
56:30 teams that i join
56:32 i'm average when it comes to
56:35 how technical i am but i bring other
56:37 things to the table
56:40 and you know whether it's soft skills
56:42 whether it is
56:43 hosting team events whether it's
56:46 suggesting new ideas for documentation
56:49 or
56:51 creating documents on the
56:54 frequently asked questions or most asked
56:57 questions during office hours whatever
56:59 it is i bring something else to the
57:00 table but uh
57:02 i'm always there right i'm i'm always
57:05 showing up to the meetings i'm always
57:06 showing up to
57:08 i'm always showing up online
57:10 and
57:11 yeah
57:12 eventually
57:13 right
57:15 consistency perseverance
57:17 yes yeah that that goes a long way and
57:20 that applies i think for any career but
57:22 uh people tend to
57:24 get discouraged when they're trying to
57:26 find that first data role
57:29 yeah i imagine that it takes like in
57:30 everything
57:32 take twitter
57:33 before you start getting your first like
57:35 you need to publish something for at
57:37 least a couple of weeks right and then
57:40 people will notice you and then people
57:41 will start liking you and the same with
57:43 getting the job right so you need to
57:45 show up on meetups right and then people
57:48 will start noticing you and then maybe
57:50 you will find
57:51 that opportunity
57:53 yeah same on uh you know not now because
57:56 um
57:59 because of the state of the world uh the
58:01 pandemic not all meetups are open or not
58:05 everyone will go but you can do the
58:08 networking online i'd say that's the the
58:11 the biggest change between 2016 and
58:13 today 2022.
58:15 but yeah it's
58:16 there is some conferences
58:19 online conferences they have this option
58:21 called networking and this is like i
58:24 don't know how it's called like random
58:26 date or basically there is a pool of
58:28 people
58:28 and this software
58:30 takes a pair of people randomly and
58:32 connects them and they can talk to to
58:35 each other for five minutes and then if
58:37 they want to continue they keep talking
58:40 i know at least
58:42 hoping
58:43 the confidence software that does this i
58:45 think other online conference software
58:47 also have this feature so if you attend
58:49 an online conference
58:51 and the main thing finished
58:53 i think it's pretty valuable to stay a
58:55 bit longer and take part in this
58:57 networking
58:58 session when you are
59:00 assigned randomly to somebody and you
59:03 can talk to them and i met
59:05 quite amazing people
59:07 and uh and they got to like we connected
59:10 on linkedin afterwards
59:12 um
59:13 yeah some of them are invited to this
59:14 podcast so that is uh that is quite
59:17 useful so do that
59:20 there's definitely value in meeting
59:22 people
59:24 yeah i think we should be wrapping up
59:27 maybe
59:28 last fast question quick question
59:31 what are some important skills
59:34 that
59:34 you should highlight on your portfolio
59:39 skills
59:43 outside of common data skills it says um
59:47 i know you mentioned these soft skills
59:49 things that you can
59:50 bring to
59:52 uh but they like
59:54 like you can
59:56 offer right that maybe don't ever
59:58 everybody not everybody is doing them
1:00:00 right
1:00:01 yeah so everybody's probably doing
1:00:04 uh exploratory data analysis data
1:00:06 wrangling
1:00:07 uh different
1:00:09 uh data visuals
1:00:11 something you can bring
1:00:13 to set yourself apart is
1:00:18 good communication being concise and
1:00:21 direct uh clear with
1:00:24 your words when you describe
1:00:27 what you're solving
1:00:29 um
1:00:31 you know i think the star method star
1:00:35 situation test action result format is
1:00:38 quite useful
1:00:39 because it summarizes your project
1:00:43 and it gives some business context uh
1:00:47 communicating business context that you
1:00:49 understand the underlying business or
1:00:51 situation under or behind your project
1:00:55 that's also important
1:00:57 uh being organized right if your project
1:01:03 is one structure
1:01:05 apartment
1:01:06 like has a clean readme that it's clear
1:01:08 what's happening there things are in
1:01:10 boulders right
1:01:12 yes uh that that goes a long way that
1:01:14 goes a long way it's so often overlooked
1:01:17 uh
1:01:18 by by engineers or by analysts when they
1:01:21 scientists when they first start out but
1:01:23 it goes a long way because eventually
1:01:25 when they bring
1:01:26 they bring you on they hire you on the
1:01:27 team
1:01:28 um
1:01:30 you know you don't want files to just be
1:01:32 on on the engineers uh laptops right
1:01:35 yeah it needs to be in a repository it
1:01:37 needs to be
1:01:40 organized in such a manner that if
1:01:41 everyone or when everyone in the team
1:01:43 leaves and you have new people
1:01:46 the work can still continue
1:01:48 successfully yeah
1:01:50 okay thanks uh yeah i think we should be
1:01:53 wrapping up anything else you want to
1:01:56 say before we finish
1:01:58 uh well thanks thank you for the
1:01:59 invitation
1:02:01 uh if
1:02:02 anyone wants to
1:02:04 get a hold of me or is somehow
1:02:06 interested in the the information i
1:02:08 shared they can
1:02:10 follow me i think i'm more active on
1:02:12 twitter than i am on linkedin but i am
1:02:13 on both so i don't know how i would be
1:02:15 able to share that
1:02:17 to them just click the links and i will
1:02:19 put them in the description description
1:02:22 okay i think i have them actually i
1:02:24 think i have both
1:02:25 okay
1:02:27 so yeah
1:02:28 that's my twitter and my linkedin should
1:02:32 be
1:02:33 quite similar
1:02:34 but let me get it
1:02:37 that juan pablo
1:02:39 yeah
1:02:40 and the website your website is that
1:02:43 juanpablo.com is it
1:02:45 yeah
1:02:47 yeah
1:02:49 that has become my brand these days not
1:02:51 very creative but that's it
1:02:55 i i guess it's easier it's already
1:02:58 uh taken right
1:03:00 it's a it's a quite common name yes
1:03:01 [Music]
1:03:03 maybe not so much outside of latin
1:03:05 american spain but the moment you go to
1:03:06 those two places
1:03:10 you don't need many
1:03:12 okay thanks a lot thanks for joining us
1:03:14 today and also thanks everyone for
1:03:16 joining us today as well and asking
1:03:18 questions
1:03:19 and yeah have a great weekend
1:03:22 thank you alexei and uh i'll see you
1:03:24 around take care thanks for the
1:03:25 invitation
