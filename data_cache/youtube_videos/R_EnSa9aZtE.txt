2:12 having me and the question for today's
2:15 interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer
2:17 thanks Johanna for your help and before
2:20 we go into our main topic
2:23 of be becoming a freelancer and
2:26 surviving as a freelancer let's start
2:28 with your background can you tell us
2:30 about your career Journey so far sure um
2:33 I started off uh studying business
2:36 administration and marketing got my
2:38 first job as a it was a marketing
2:41 position but it turned out into a data
2:43 position very fast um after that I
2:47 joined how how did it actually turn into
2:50 a data position well I imagine like in
2:52 marketing you have all this paid
2:54 marketing campaigns like all these
2:56 different campaigns and you need to
2:58 effectively measure that this is how you
3:00 ended up in data right no no
3:04 okay um very simple what was a French
3:07 startup they just wanted to um translate
3:10 their website into different languages
3:12 um so I translated the website for them
3:15 uh my goal was to then after the
3:17 translation uh attract
3:20 um uh users and customers to the
3:23 platform and I've done the translation
3:27 and let's say I don't call it marketing
3:30 I call it more spamming uh after I done
3:32 this for a month more or less um my qu
3:35 big question was who did I attract who
3:37 is uh who's using now our platform and
3:39 everything so it was a startup for
3:42 people um I was the only marketeer uh um
3:45 spite the founder so my goal was
3:48 basically um to learn SQL um make the
3:51 first requests um do some analysis
3:55 cohort analysis and so on and uh yeah
3:57 and that's basically how I um build some
4:00 very nice
4:02 infographics and uh we actually used
4:04 those later on to get some uh to get
4:07 featured in uh in some newspapers French
4:11 newspapers and yeah that was pretty
4:12 successful and uh the my founder he was
4:17 basically very uh happy with that so he
4:18 asked me to keep digging into the data
4:21 uh instead of doing
4:23 marketing you origin from France no I'm
4:27 half German half Italian uhuh
4:30 and now you live in Spain and before
4:32 that you lived in
4:34 France uh correct and before that I also
4:36 lived in Malta and okay um yeah a little
4:40 bit everywhere that's amazing okay so
4:44 you joined the company the French
4:46 startup as a marketing person you became
4:48 a data person cu the founders were they
4:51 really liked the results they saw like
4:53 your dashboards so they said they told
4:55 you like how about you do this fulltime
4:58 right um again I was there fulltime but
5:01 uh yeah but in that sense yeah yes um
5:05 because it was uh again they they start
5:07 learning about uh um about their own
5:10 users what they have done about the
5:11 French Market because the French Market
5:13 was their main market and um they never
5:15 thought about again if you start a
5:18 business most of the time they have
5:19 their one priority to survive get
5:21 clients but they never had the time to
5:24 look at the data and again they had
5:26 actually pretty pretty good data at that
5:28 time and um yeah was enough to um learn
5:32 more about the clients about their
5:33 behavior um so we could more uh better
5:37 build basically um customer
5:42 profiles and then uh after that
5:45 experience I wanted to see uh the
5:48 opposite side of the startup world so I
5:50 joined hulet peckard uh corporate world
5:53 and I joined their data Department in
5:56 Barcelona and yeah that was basically um
5:59 a data Department um of their sales team
6:02 they had 140 people sales team they had
6:05 regional managers a big head of uh and I
6:08 was directly um reporting to the head of
6:12 who was supervising basically those 140
6:14 people sales team so that was pretty
6:16 interesting because we um um we did a
6:19 lot of uh was a lot of bi involved but
6:22 also some analysis we did specific
6:23 campaigns where even the sales people
6:26 had to compete against each each other
6:29 and um so was again their phone activity
6:33 the CRM data um combining it everything
6:36 together specific performance kpis that
6:38 they had to hit and we had data about it
6:40 sales data um put it all together and
6:43 again it was great fun and um yeah so
6:46 that that was basically my uh corporate
6:48 experience at that time you need to
6:50 speak Spanish to work there no at that
6:54 time my Spanish was very basic it was
6:57 basically speaking Italian just adding
6:59 an s to the end and making it sound
7:02 Spanish but uh the team everything was
7:05 English okay cuz like sales CET pcket
7:10 clients sounds like something that
7:13 requires the native the the language
7:15 that is booken in the country definitely
7:18 if if if you're part of the sales team
7:19 but again it was a European wide sales
7:21 team so they had German speakers they
7:24 Italian speakers they had um Norwegian
7:28 Swedish people like was a big team again
7:30 140 sales people and covering whole
7:33 Europe then did you become a freelancer
7:36 after that or you had a few other no
7:39 that was that was the time basically
7:41 where um I as a let's say as a business
7:46 person and having very
7:48 rudimental um technical skills I just
7:51 learned SQL basically and I done tons of
7:54 online courses um around programming and
7:58 uh reading up on big data and data
8:00 science at that time so at that uh
8:03 moment I I said to myself I really want
8:05 to learn more about this world um I
8:07 can't do it just uh by myself and I
8:10 can't do it just uh after work I need to
8:12 dive deep fulltime into this so I
8:14 decided to do a MS program um basically
8:18 covering data science topic um such as
8:20 supervised learning
8:21 NLP um again just uh various statistical
8:25 classes and yeah so I did this at
8:28 University College
8:30 um was a was a very challenging year but
8:33 uh learned a lot and basically that year
8:35 then led me to my next position where I
8:38 earned the title as a data scientist
8:40 which at that time I was very proud of
8:42 and um I joined something in between a
8:45 startup and a corporate I call it a
8:47 scale up and um at that time I was an
8:50 online casino based in
8:53 Malta that's how you ended up in Malta
8:56 after yes dayk yes correct you're trying
9:00 to map out my my journey and uh I think
9:03 it's quite common for online casinos to
9:05 be either in Malta or Cyprus right yes
9:08 correct due to legislations and I think
9:11 the whole um ecosystem
9:14 overall and yeah so I basically joined
9:17 them um and there basically the goal um
9:21 was again connected to marketing
9:23 connected to data science so the first
9:25 more data sciency project um in
9:29 marketing basically evolved um I join
9:31 and it was again it was not any more
9:33 smaller data team it was already a
9:35 bigger team were like 12 people with a
9:37 four data Engineers several data
9:38 scientist some statisticians and uh some
9:42 bi Specialists so we're supporting
9:44 supporting all each other learning from
9:46 each other so that was a very great
9:48 experience and uh yeah but it was have
9:51 to men it was a short experience because
9:54 at that time I um my now wife she moved
9:58 to Germany so so I want to follow her
10:02 and uh in that case I switched I made my
10:05 last move to uh my last uh step before
10:08 becoming a freelancer and that was um a
10:11 girl partnered consulting
10:15 firm yeah so now I'm at the Google
10:17 partner consulting firm again uh they
10:20 are they were basically specialized in
10:24 digital analytics and uh conversion
10:27 optimization so they were working with
10:28 all the Google marketing cloud and that
10:31 was basically their um their core
10:33 business but uh as they had um very good
10:37 ties to their clients and they basically
10:39 learned a lot through them they um they
10:43 basically didn't want to stop the
10:44 relationship once those Google products
10:46 were implemented but now they wanted to
10:48 offer additional service that's why they
10:50 started uh building up the small data
10:52 science team which I was part of and
10:56 yeah and while I was there basically I
10:58 learned everything
11:00 uh basically um there I learned
11:02 everything to start off my freelancing
11:04 business because again it was my first
11:06 uh touch point with the world of
11:09 Consulting so this company Google
11:12 partner consulting firm so they they're
11:15 already doing consulting and you saw H
11:17 interesting I can do this myself too and
11:19 then you saw how actually it works and
11:23 you made the switch right this is how it
11:25 happened more or less um I mean the
11:28 switch also happens uh because of let's
11:31 say who I am and my nature I mean I
11:33 enjoyed all the placees where I worked I
11:36 made great friends which I'm still in
11:38 touch with today but I have this nature
11:40 where I always thought that it could go
11:42 better and I was uh often sometimes
11:46 loudly and sometimes just internally
11:48 complaining um how businesses should use
11:51 data and I saw things that I thought
11:55 this doesn't add any value to the
11:56 business these are just i r Tower fun
11:58 fun projects but again no value and uh
12:03 after you comp after you complain to
12:05 your wife uh many nights she will tell
12:08 you to basically do it better and uh do
12:11 it yourself then and that was basically
12:13 the motivator after so many years
12:15 because I felt like in a short range I
12:18 was jumping around from one company to
12:20 another which was on the one side was
12:22 great because I learned a lot on the
12:24 other side your CV your corporate CV
12:27 let's say like this um didn't that great
12:29 because companies every time you
12:30 interview they ask are you going to stay
12:32 here or are you going to move on uh
12:34 which is of course a totally um expected
12:38 question so for a freelancer this
12:41 is like the kind of know the answer
12:43 right yes hire you for a short amount so
12:47 they don't even that yes and I think the
12:49 value of a freelancer is exactly that
12:51 you have seen lots of different
12:53 scenarios um or very similar scenarios
12:55 at different companies and that's
12:57 exactly the reason why they hire you
12:59 because you have seen it more than
13:03 once then you were complaining to your
13:06 wife about not liking um certain things
13:09 and then she said like do it yourself do
13:11 it better and then you're like okay I'm
13:14 becoming a data freelancer correct right
13:17 what happened next after that like what
13:19 exactly what were the steps
13:23 you wa after this discussion three your
13:27 wife kind of approved yeah I I mean
13:31 there was a there was a I mean not one
13:33 discussion but multiple but at some
13:35 point I I told myself now it has to be
13:37 uh um it's about time so I um I resigned
13:43 um from the company I had uh if I
13:46 remember right I think four month six
13:48 month I don't remember exactly uh like
13:50 the notice period And in that period
13:54 basically uh I started reaching out to
13:57 anyone um that I could think of or find
14:00 of you resigned but you did not have a
14:02 client yet no I I I just resigned
14:05 because I was a little bit frustrated at
14:07 the time and again and I thought uh
14:09 everything starts off by basically
14:12 pulling out the the bad tooth you know
14:13 and I was yeah so that was basically the
14:15 reason like you need to make the jump
14:18 correct because like I I had this
14:20 conversation with one of the recruiters
14:22 it was like four years ago maybe I
14:24 remember I had a business trip to
14:26 Amsterdam and then in Amsterdam they
14:28 called so what he what he told me was
14:31 like hey uh I have this uh like a bunch
14:35 of amazing clients and your data science
14:38 expertise will be very helpful for
14:41 clients and like he said that they give
14:44 like, or
14:46 1,500 per day which was like an insane
14:49 amount of money uh and like okay okay
14:52 like where you assign and then he said
14:54 like what's your noce period and I'm
14:56 like um yeah four months and yeah like
14:59 we actually need somebody next week
15:01 right and then okay like and I started
15:04 asking him like how can I you know
15:07 become a freelancer because like this
15:09 particular client would would not wait
15:11 for me like for four months right uh and
15:14 he like yeah you first quit you first
15:16 quit then you wait for your notice
15:18 period then you give me a call right and
15:20 then maybe we will have another client
15:22 for you and I'm like
15:25 [Music]
15:26 uh I'm not so sure about that not risky
15:30 right yeah like cuz like I already have
15:32 a job and this is a wellpay job right
15:34 like I like my job and it's like
15:37 quitting it and waiting for four four
15:38 months for something that might be
15:41 available might not be like it's not
15:44 clear like there is so much there's so
15:48 much unknown there right yeah definitely
15:51 you right yeah I I I made the jump I
15:54 just jumped into the cold water
15:55 basically um yeah and basically in this
15:59 resignation um I was already uh
16:03 swallowing down like a thick something
16:06 that I thought okay now I have four
16:08 months basically to get ready for this
16:10 and um what what what should I do next
16:13 so basically I um I did my research um I
16:18 reached out to first of all people in my
16:22 network at the time which are again
16:24 startup Network that I've met um told
16:27 them that I was going free L but of
16:29 course from those people I didn't hear
16:31 anything back
16:32 um then the next step was I reached out
16:36 to other data Freelancers that I could
16:38 find off on LinkedIn for example
16:41 and unfortunately I couldn't find that
16:44 manyy I found some but uh not as many as
16:47 I was hoping for um but those I found
16:50 they were uh kind enough to jump on a
16:52 call and basically I asked them a bunch
16:55 of questions on how they started off and
16:57 any advice they could give give me and
17:00 uh people who you already knew or it was
17:02 like did cold Outreach so like you see
17:05 that they have a freelancer in their
17:08 title then you would probably craft a
17:10 welcome yes like you know this
17:12 connection message when you connect with
17:13 somebody on LinkedIn him like
17:15 I'm I want to do a freelance like I want
17:18 to start freelancing can can I ask you a
17:20 few question something like that yes
17:22 correct exactly that I mean I you I
17:25 always like to use my little um Google
17:27 trick where you say things like you know
17:29 like site colon LinkedIn slin so
17:32 whatever you type afterwards you only
17:33 get uh LinkedIn profiles and then I just
17:36 wrote down like data freelance uh or
17:39 data scientist freelancer and different
17:41 uh terms like this and then I got a
17:43 couple of profiles and I was um making
17:45 sure that they are at that time based
17:48 either in Germany or in Europe because I
17:49 was still in Germany at that time and I
17:51 had to register as a freelancer in
17:52 Germany and um so I want to make that
17:55 their their experience and their advice
17:57 they will give me is relevant to um
18:00 basically outside my field that's why
18:02 you move to Spain right because like
18:03 it's so difficult to register in Germany
18:05 as a freelance I don't remember it was
18:08 that difficult but uh I made it I made
18:11 it at the end and
18:13 um and like there are companies you can
18:16 pay do this for you because like it's
18:18 not
18:19 easy yeah indeed but um yeah at the end
18:22 uh made it and um again got some great
18:25 advice from the few people that were
18:26 kind enough at that time uh talked to me
18:29 and the last thing that I was doing was
18:32 um similar to what you just said you
18:34 talked to a recruiter who told you that
18:36 your um experience is relevant and um I
18:40 had some reaching out to me before which
18:42 also kind of encouraged me that there is
18:43 a need um for me out there as a
18:47 freelancer and um that's why I thought
18:50 hey let me reach out to that uh
18:51 recruiter and not only him but also all
18:54 others that I could find and tell them
18:55 hey on this date I will be a freelancer
18:58 provide me a project basically um yeah
19:01 and that was that was how I started
19:03 before I actually started
19:05 officially um recuit or multiple
19:08 multiple I again if I had the four
19:11 months so exclusivity right so you can
19:14 be with multiple recruiters you can be
19:16 with multiple recruiters um but if you
19:20 apply for a project you should apply
19:22 only through
19:24 one otherwise you otherwise you
19:27 eliminate yourself because two um two
19:31 recruiters will present your profile and
19:33 then they have kind of a conflict so
19:35 then they will have to eliminate you
19:37 that's why you can only go with one
19:38 recruiter if it's for the same position
19:41 uhuh so there is a company and you see
19:43 that this you know that this company
19:46 looks for a freelancer then with a
19:49 recruiter you select the recruiter who
19:51 you like more right and then ask uh them
19:54 to represent you or more or less more or
19:58 less
19:59 um
20:01 again just just uh to make for the
20:04 listeners what we talk now often I would
20:06 um call this uh
20:08 Contracting and it's part of freelancing
20:11 but again I think it's the specific
20:13 route that uh I think um just needs to
20:16 be addressed and Contracting is usually
20:18 when a company says I need to hire
20:21 someone but this person is not a
20:22 full-time employee but uh let's say a
20:24 freelancer which I can hire for um 36 12
20:28 month um and then after that period I
20:31 can basically let go of that person and
20:35 you don't Contra right yeah that's
20:37 Contracting and again you kind of have a
20:39 specific contract with them and
20:41 sometimes it can also be that you kind
20:43 of are working 40 hours a week for them
20:45 so you are kind of a full-time employee
20:47 but you're not so that's specific
20:51 thing like your contract is limited
20:54 right it's only for a certain amount of
20:56 time and then I guess both sides can end
20:59 this contract sooner right yes correct
21:02 don't don't need to wait till the
21:04 contract is over like you don't need to
21:06 have this notice or four months I assume
21:09 it's much F correct and um yeah and uh
21:14 again there are also things uh tied to
21:16 it that you have to be careful as a
21:18 freelancer if you go to this route
21:20 because um there are things like uh fake
21:22 freelancer and different um countries
21:26 have different names for but basically
21:28 it's like a fake freelancer where the
21:30 company is saving lots of money because
21:32 they hire someone uh external and they
21:35 basically just pay them the project fee
21:38 and you as a freelancer basically only
21:41 depend on the salary of one client so
21:45 actually the client the company they
21:47 should um pay their the like the typical
21:50 legal contribution to health care and so
21:52 on but in this case they don't so that's
21:55 why the freelancer needs to be careful
21:56 not to tap into do like this fake
21:59 freelancing um thing once they do their
22:01 text
22:02 declarations yeah just throwing it out
22:05 there um for those who have thought
22:06 about it so it's always important to
22:09 again have multiple clients and if one
22:13 is interested going that um Contracting
22:15 route um it's just something to be aware
22:18 of not to put all your X in one basket
22:22 and um focus too much on on this
22:25 Contracting and going back to the
22:28 recruiter station cuz I'm a bit confused
22:30 so let's say you got a call from one
22:32 recruiter they get your CV and then you
22:35 get a call from another recuiter and you
22:37 also share your CV with them so they
22:39 kind of both represent you right so how
22:42 do you and then you want to like there's
22:44 a company there you want to work MH and
22:49 so I understand this is called
22:50 Contracting but like how do you exactly
22:52 deal with this two recruiters uh
22:55 situation well the way it usually works
22:57 is that it's start starts off with a
22:58 company that wants to hire a data
23:01 analyst a data scientist a data engineer
23:03 Let It Be and they basically especially
23:07 in the corporate world um most of them
23:10 that reach out to uh recruiters they
23:12 have their recruiter Network so they
23:14 basically sent them out an email and
23:16 saying like to all their recruiters hey
23:17 recruiters we are looking for this type
23:19 of profile um find us someone so now the
23:23 recruiters get the that profile and they
23:26 basically send it to their Network and
23:29 that could be a freelancer like me and
23:31 now I could be in part of I could be in
23:33 the network of two different uh
23:35 recruiters so now both of them send this
23:37 profile to me and say like are you
23:39 interested in applying for this profile
23:41 so I can I can um talk either to one of
23:46 them or both of them and ask them who is
23:48 the client get some information and once
23:50 I have this information I could uh
23:53 either decide to go with one of them but
23:56 uh I should also for example in the past
23:59 apply to um one client another recruiter
24:01 approached me and I tell them like hey I
24:03 already applied for this position
24:04 through another uh recruiter so and they
24:06 will know that of course you won't apply
24:08 because you don't want to eliminate
24:10 yourself and they eliminate yourself it
24:13 means that when the companies see that
24:15 the same like there are two Recruiters
24:17 in the same person they do not consider
24:20 this person or correct
24:23 correct good question um I can give you
24:27 an exact answer should ask a recruiter
24:29 but I only know that they always tell me
24:31 like um and and usually they ask also uh
24:35 um they usually ask if you have applied
24:37 to this project through another
24:39 recruiter or they all or they warn you
24:41 they say hey if someone else approached
24:43 you about this project don't apply
24:44 through them and maybe maybe it's a a
24:47 fake myth maybe it's a fake myth maybe
24:50 it's the way that you know they increase
24:51 their chance of placing you as a client
24:54 but
24:55 um I mean yeah I understand okay uh we
24:59 have quite a few questions actually um
25:02 so maybe
25:04 we take some of them because I think
25:07 it's relevant to our discussion sure so
25:09 how do you know what to charge when you
25:12 first start out like I quit my full-time
25:15 job I'm waiting for the notice period
25:18 and then there is a potential client and
25:20 then they ask how much do you charge and
25:22 then what do I tell
25:23 them again there are different ways of
25:26 getting clients and I have to mention
25:28 that because it depends on how I charge
25:30 and uh let's just go through very
25:32 typical ways how I could get a client um
25:35 first and then I answer that question if
25:37 that's okay usually there are let's say
25:42 I say four types of channels that
25:44 usually Freelancers get uh clients the
25:46 first one are um online uh freelancing
25:51 platforms such as upwork for
25:53 example there are clients that put their
25:55 project on you can basically create a
25:58 profile and then directly apply to them
26:00 and here the pricing I charge depends on
26:03 my experience my profile um if I'm new
26:07 on a platform like upwork and I don't
26:09 have any star rating for example then of
26:12 course it's hard for me to charge very
26:14 high prices because the client will see
26:15 my profile things like oh is this person
26:18 actually real um they've never done
26:20 anything on here so of course it's very
26:22 hard to get into that it also depends on
26:24 the nature of the project if it's a very
26:27 um you need some very specific LL llm
26:31 skills and you know things that are very
26:33 new and only some people are very
26:34 specialized in that maybe then yes you
26:37 you can command a higher price because
26:38 there not there's not as much
26:39 competition out there so again in this
26:42 case in this case just want to make sure
26:45 I understood you correctly so there is
26:47 these online freelancing platforms like
26:49 upwork and if somebody needs some work
26:53 so they kind of create a listing yes and
26:56 then you as a freelancer and other
26:58 Freelancers see this listings yes
27:00 correct okay like this is the job I can
27:03 do this job and this is how much I want
27:04 to charge for this for my services
27:07 correct and in the job you see what kind
27:09 of things they need so you can put the
27:11 price higher if they require something
27:14 unique that not many people have or like
27:17 if it's a typical data science project
27:19 and then you don't have you haven't done
27:21 many projects in the past on upwork you
27:23 don't have like any ratings then you
27:25 probably should go for lower price so
27:27 they pick you up correct and then get
27:29 and you get the the reviews yes so every
27:33 basically Channel every situation it
27:36 depends on the client it depends on you
27:38 needs to have their specific let's say
27:40 uh strategy how you approach it and in
27:43 this case for example if I'm new to a
27:44 platform like upwork and I'm uh very
27:49 let's say average analyst um I can
27:52 create dashboards I can create some
27:53 analysis but there's nothing let's say
27:55 where you say hey I have 10 years of
27:57 special experience or I'm very good with
27:59 an outstanding experience with something
28:01 sometimes you have to compete on price
28:03 to get to get started because your goal
28:04 is to increase your reputation get five
28:07 star reviews on those platforms and um
28:11 that could be one way so how you find
28:13 your rate for for this type of Channel
28:15 usually by checking out other um
28:18 freelancer profiles on upwork seeing
28:20 what they usually charge um I believe
28:24 platforms like upwork and Fiverr um you
28:27 can have like I think a premium uh
28:31 there's a premium subscription as a
28:32 freelancer so you get a little bit more
28:35 insights about the project how many
28:38 other people have applied to it what is
28:40 the the what bits did the the other
28:43 freelancer give um what types of
28:45 basically range of like the project uh
28:47 they basically applied for yes so so you
28:51 can see okay people for this project uh
28:53 let's just invent a number uh gave
28:55 thousand uh, uh for this project and
28:58 then as a minimum and maybe the maximum
29:00 was 3,000 and now you come in with 500
29:03 you know and as as an example but again
29:06 it's not just price there are so much
29:08 other things going on but I mean that
29:10 that's how I would approach uh those
29:12 platforms then the second Channel we
29:14 just discussed it it's like the
29:16 Contracting and it's basically talking
29:18 to recruiters and here I would again do
29:22 some research uh there are some
29:24 platforms such as um I think freelancer
29:27 map
29:28 um I think freelancer.com if I don't if
29:31 I'm not wrong and there are kind of like
29:33 directories where Freelancers have their
29:37 profile and you can go and Scout those
29:39 Freelancers compare yourself to them
29:41 figure out what do they charge by hour
29:43 by day for example and um get a good
29:47 feeling for that and when you talk to
29:49 the recruiters usually the recruiter
29:50 knows exactly what this client is
29:53 willing to pay like the usually they
29:55 tell you like if it's a we have a range
29:58 between I don't know 80 to 100 EUR an
30:01 hour or 100 to 120 I mean usually the
30:03 client has to tell the recruiter
30:05 otherwise the recruiter can find a
30:06 suitable uh candidate for that so you
30:09 can ask the recruiters you can tell them
30:11 like do you know what is the client
30:12 willing to charge um and then based on
30:15 that you can basically pick your number
30:18 here it's more like give or take you
30:19 don't
30:21 really as long as you as long as that
30:24 that's sometimes the good part of it
30:26 because as long as you take the boxes
30:29 and you basically have the skills that
30:31 the client is requesting for ask uh I
30:34 mean usually the the the recruiter has
30:39 uh the interest of basically placing you
30:40 there so they just tell you what the
30:42 client will as willing to charge and you
30:44 can basically say yes fine with me or
30:46 not and usually from my experience with
30:49 interacting with these recruiters even
30:51 though I did not lend any contract uh in
30:55 the past usually they give this um like
30:59 the sum up front and usually it's quite
31:01 a good one so the the one I told you
31:03 about uh
31:05 like it was like 1,000 or more like it's
31:09 quite large I think most of them were
31:12 lower but still they would just give
31:14 they would just tell you up front like
31:15 okay it's 800 per day right and this is
31:18 what the client has money for like they
31:20 won't get
31:22 any correct um so that's why their their
31:25 goal is basically to make money out of
31:27 out of you or other candidates that they
31:29 are able to place so they will be very
31:32 transparent with you they their goal is
31:33 to give you good feedback so that your
31:35 application basically has an impact on
31:37 their client and um yeah so the the best
31:40 thing is if you talk to them be open be
31:42 upfront ask them the questions I mean
31:45 usually they don't have a reason to hide
31:47 things um sometimes they want to be
31:49 careful at the beginning to uh like tell
31:52 you who's the client and little things
31:54 like this but uh regarding basically the
31:57 application part they are pretty open
31:59 about
32:01 that then I mentioned before there are
32:04 more channels to get clients um third
32:06 one yes the third one is usually the um
32:11 Network and um often how I see it and
32:16 how also other freelances that I talk to
32:18 with fre uh with the network we usually
32:21 don't just mean LinkedIn because people
32:22 think always about network is equal to
32:25 LinkedIn but usually network is the
32:27 companies and the people that work in
32:29 companies that you actually know and are
32:31 um have a very close relationship to or
32:34 at least uh hold a regular relationship
32:37 with and uh with those um clients or
32:41 companies um that are in your network um
32:44 if you have a close relationship you
32:45 hear what they work on you hear um if
32:47 they're looking for someone and a
32:49 network like this you don't have it from
32:51 day one you build it up you build it up
32:53 and it can even start um like I did I
32:56 started out uh I started out on upwork
32:59 um got to know the first uh few
33:02 companies there had very small projects
33:04 with them nothing that's uh that I'm
33:06 basically proud of of mentioning like in
33:08 terms of I made a lot of money but it
33:10 was um getting to know the people
33:13 getting to know the the industry the
33:15 business they are in and uh after
33:18 delivering good projects asking them if
33:20 they know other people um that need my
33:22 services and basically those people then
33:23 referred me to other uh um friends or
33:26 colle or other departments depending
33:29 always on the uh on the client and yeah
33:33 so basically that was uh how I buildt up
33:35 my network and how other Freelancers
33:37 basically build up their Network and get
33:39 more projects through
33:42 them fourth and the fourth one is
33:45 basically uh the magic of marketing and
33:49 uh here I think um it really depends on
33:53 some people try different uh approaches
33:56 some try really the the cold approach
33:58 emailing people um some others are very
34:03 Innovative the other day I read from
34:05 some other freelancer that they try to
34:07 scout um data profiles on LinkedIn that
34:11 are kind of not realistic and we
34:14 probably have seen them uh all where a
34:17 company is looking for someone that has
34:20 only one year of experience but knows
34:22 tons of tools and tons of stuff and they
34:25 are pretty sure that they won't be able
34:27 to fill that position so they reach out
34:29 to the company and uh tell them like as
34:32 long as you're looking for someone maybe
34:33 I can help you I mean again there are
34:36 different let's say marketing channels
34:38 tactics tricks but that's for me like
34:40 the force Channel where people are very
34:41 creative
34:43 and so if you let's say post regularly
34:46 on
34:47 LinkedIn and among other posts also kind
34:50 of advertise your services that would be
34:52 the channel yes for example self
34:55 marketing let's call it like this
34:59 that's also called Outreach and if
35:01 somebody found you
35:04 through I guess if it's like uh your
35:07 friend or other company then it would be
35:08 the third approach Network and if they
35:10 found you through your LinkedIn post it
35:13 would be the fourth one right correct
35:17 correct yeah and like you said uh when
35:20 we I don't know 20 minutes ago you said
35:23 that there is a distinction there is a
35:24 difference between Contracting and
35:26 freelancing
35:27 yes so Contracting is a second approach
35:30 where we have recruiters but what is
35:33 freelancing like how is it different
35:35 like what's the difference between these
35:37 two well I would say that first of all
35:41 as a freelancer you are like a business
35:43 entity and it basically means that you
35:46 are independent independent from other
35:48 uh companies you're not an employee you
35:50 work at the time you want you work for
35:52 the rate you want you work at the the
35:54 place you want no company can tell you
35:56 where to work from so that's the first
35:58 thing and Contracting is just um one sub
36:02 it's it's part of uh freelancing but
36:05 again it's one uh I think uh bucket uh
36:08 below it basically where you can say as
36:09 a freelancer yes I'm freelancing on upw
36:12 work doing some projects there I have my
36:14 network maybe I have a Contracting uh
36:18 project going on with a client so there
36:20 are different ways but the important
36:21 part is um that a freelancer is
36:25 independent and any sense basically and
36:28 it's their own business
36:30 entity let's say with up work you don't
36:33 necessarily have any strict contracts
36:36 like I don't know 12 Pages 20 Pages
36:38 contracts that you sign in German right
36:41 it's more like through the
36:42 platform right yes well you you sign
36:45 their terms and conditions and uh uhuh
36:48 but like it's not um the contracts there
36:50 I guess are different from what you
36:52 would get like let's say if you worked
36:55 on site with a client only for four
36:58 months right so that would be the
37:00 contract while
37:02 in online freelancing up work it's like
37:06 more remote more
37:07 flexible maybe the contract is different
37:10 right yes correct um it's all depends on
37:13 on the contract um and the nature uh
37:16 also each channel has their own nature
37:18 of projects as you can imagine uh upwork
37:22 has tons of projects which are very
37:23 small and limited uh in terms of quick
37:27 ones to turn around and yes sometimes
37:30 there are also smaller companies or also
37:33 even large companies on there um looking
37:35 for um similar to Contracting um where
37:38 they try to hire you for a long period
37:40 of time but um the goal is usually
37:43 that's the good thing about upwork it's
37:46 kind of tries to keep down in terms of a
37:47 project and uh whereas uh if you sign
37:51 through a recruiter there's usually a
37:54 very um defined contract made through
37:58 them between you and the contractor the
38:00 contractor and the end
38:02 client and let's say if you find a
38:05 company through your
38:06 network I don't know let's take an
38:09 example zando which is like a large
38:11 online uh e-commerce right yeah so like
38:16 you can find there are there are
38:18 Freelancers who might represent the land
38:20 right and there are people in the
38:22 company who you know right who can tell
38:24 you um like okay we're looking for a
38:28 freelancer and in one case with a
38:31 recruiter you have recruiter who helps
38:33 you with the Bress who probably know
38:36 like uh how the contract should look
38:38 like and all that and in case of the
38:41 other case like there's nobody in
38:43 between it's just you and the company
38:45 right of course is it still called
38:49 Contracting good question I never
38:51 thought about this way but um now you
38:54 catch me off guard uh but uh no and in
38:57 that sense basically is
38:59 also that's the beauty if you go through
39:02 the through the middleman which is the
39:04 agency or the the recruiter the
39:07 relationship is very much defined by
39:08 them um by them and zando and basically
39:12 you're just the service provider if I
39:15 have a contact at zando and I can
39:17 directly Talk work with them I usually
39:19 have a whole way of framing the whole
39:22 project and I can um it might be
39:24 completely different because maybe they
39:26 need a marketing data uh scientist for
39:30 uh their media mix modeling for example
39:33 and now they uh they say hey we need a
39:36 four month some data scientist that can
39:38 help us through that so now they talk to
39:40 the recruiter the recruiter finds me and
39:41 I can work with them but if they would
39:44 have talked to me directly I might have
39:46 said yes uh I can build that with you
39:49 but I can also bring on maybe some
39:52 subcontractors that I work with um
39:55 instead of selling my my time by hour I
39:57 could have um used different pricing
39:59 models um for that I could have framed
40:02 it as more as a project for example and
40:05 um so that that's the freedom that you
40:08 have when you can directly talk to the
40:10 end client and that's why I wouldn't
40:12 call that uh Contracting that much as
40:14 the first approach with the
40:17 recruiter so which
40:19 one I guess each has pros and cons but
40:22 like for somebody who
40:24 starts the option with recruiter is
40:27 better
40:28 or I
40:30 mean if you start out and you have a
40:32 contact at Sando and you know exactly
40:35 how to deliver everything I mean why
40:38 going with um why going with a a
40:41 recruiter because you already know what
40:43 you're going to deliver but most people
40:45 who start out they don't have the the
40:48 network yet and usually going with a
40:51 recruiter is the easy way in and to be
40:55 honest yes the recruiter will take part
40:57 of basically the budget um but you also
41:02 have kind of a secure first project with
41:06 a nice contract and um usually um it's a
41:11 safe way in um and at least it gives you
41:14 some let's say money for the beginning
41:16 because usually um
41:19 the the agency or the recruiter has
41:22 their agreement with the end company how
41:26 they get the money and you as a
41:28 freelancer get the money from the agency
41:30 and sometimes you have the contract that
41:32 they pay you out every two weeks every
41:35 four weeks or like by month and um that
41:38 could kind of be like a small salary and
41:39 especially at the beginning I think that
41:41 could be also um usually the nice way
41:46 in and uh yeah with agencies I assume
41:51 they have some sort of agreement like
41:53 non gapit or how it's called where
41:57 like after let's say your contract for
41:59 four months ended and somebody from
42:02 zelanda says you I have project here but
42:05 don't talk your recruiter right it's
42:07 probably not going to work you still
42:08 need to to work through the the
42:11 recruiter um it I mean you don't have to
42:15 I mean contracts are there to be broken
42:18 um so it really depends I mean if
42:21 there's the case because there's also a
42:24 incentive for both parties to skip the
42:27 recruiter because they pay less you earn
42:29 more you basically you meet in the
42:31 middle because now what the what the
42:33 recruiter was basically taking away
42:36 that's what what you basically split in
42:37 half and uh so there's a benefit for
42:39 both of them um but usually companies
42:42 like zando um they also have an interest
42:45 to have um a strategic interest of
42:48 having long-term relationship with those
42:50 recruiters um and that's why they don't
42:53 like to um go by um the these rules and
42:56 basically stick to them because they
42:58 already have their process set up they
43:00 they're not that easily corruptible it's
43:03 it's it's similar thing on upwork where
43:07 you're supposed to do all the projects
43:09 on upwork but who says that after maybe
43:12 a project you take the client and you
43:14 both go outside of upw work because now
43:16 you know each other you trust each other
43:19 and um it's a a different thing so that
43:22 one is also possible for
43:24 example yeah and hope nobody from zando
43:27 legal team is listening
43:29 to now this is just an example right use
43:33 it as an example just fictitious example
43:36 yeah so it's maybe a different company
43:38 with the same name right okay there's
43:42 another question I think you partly
43:44 answered that but maybe there's
43:46 something look at so how do you go about
43:48 looking for freelance jobs do you have
43:50 any favorite websites to V the requester
43:54 uh that um yeah so that it asks is there
43:58 any way to vet the requester to make
44:00 sure that they actually pay after the
44:02 project is done so probably there are
44:04 two questions in one so we can start
44:06 with the first one how do you go about
44:08 looking for freelance jobs and I think
44:10 you kind of gave the answer already with
44:12 these four ways is there anything you
44:14 want to add no I mean again I can repeat
44:17 them for that list there basically um
44:20 again usually like online freelancing
44:22 platform such as upwork um topt I don't
44:25 know that different ones um then going
44:29 through recruiters which are basically
44:31 connected already to the end client your
44:33 own network that you build up for any
44:36 basically self marketing um that you can
44:38 do write maybe your blog promote your uh
44:42 your knowledge um yeah have a portfolio
44:45 online which which people basically can
44:47 see um that's basically the typical um
44:51 way of uh getting clients and um the
44:54 second question I think was about so it
44:56 was about checking the like how good the
45:00 clients are about the reputation if how
45:04 you want to make sure that they would
45:05 actually pay how can you do that and if
45:08 there is any like website like I don't
45:10 know Google Maps kind of where you can
45:13 see like reviews from other Freelancers
45:17 yeah I mean if you go to online uh
45:20 online um uh freelance platforms as
45:24 mentioned before upward
45:26 there you as a freelancer but also the
45:29 client both get um both get like the
45:32 typical five star or like the star
45:34 rating um after every project and uh
45:37 when you apply to a new um to a new
45:39 project you can basically see how good
45:41 is the the other party basically the
45:43 client that you apply for if you go
45:45 through um recruiters again usually
45:48 there are real businesses um and they
45:52 often have a Google on Google Maps they
45:54 have their Google business account and
45:57 that you can also um get feedback from
45:59 them and uh and that um yeah basically
46:03 concludes it um so far but to be honest
46:05 that's a question that I often hear I
46:07 don't know how many people had bad
46:08 experience with that I have had or I've
46:12 been working with clients I think from
46:14 all over the world and I haven't had any
46:18 problem with clients paying me I mean I
46:20 had other T types of problems but not
46:23 that they don't pay
46:24 me yeah usually from what I know and
46:27 it's also my experience uh right in the
46:30 community that the problem is not that
46:32 they don't have money the problem is
46:35 that it's very bureaucratic so you often
46:38 need to to wait till you actually get
46:41 paid especially in big companies where
46:43 like there is this procurement
46:45 Department there's finance department
46:47 they need to talk to each other then you
46:49 need like somebody goes on vacation they
46:50 forget about you then you need to
46:52 constantly ping them do you have this
46:54 sort of experience
46:57 um not that much
46:59 [Music]
47:01 um maybe I haven't worked with two many
47:04 those large companies but even I've
47:07 worked I'd say probably at least around
47:10 10 of them and again so
47:13 far they were good clients paid on time
47:17 um very simple to work with but again uh
47:20 large very large clients there are only
47:22 a few of them there are tons of
47:24 mediumsized businesses um that uh do a
47:27 lot of data work and that have um very
47:30 attractive budgets and um they don't
47:34 have those strict processes um and with
47:36 them you can very easily I mean you have
47:39 a project with someone in there could be
47:42 a chief marketing officer or someone you
47:44 send them there see your invoice at the
47:46 end of the project or up front depending
47:48 on how you charge them and uh they just
47:51 forward it to their finance department
47:52 they pay it out and I mean very simple
47:55 or if it's a startup the founder just
47:57 paypals you the money yes and then is
48:02 done um okay uh a question from Alexi is
48:07 freelance a good idea for a second job
48:11 like I I guess the question is like I
48:13 already have a full-time job and like
48:16 after six it's kind of boring I don't
48:18 just want to buy down on software and
48:20 check Tik Tok or do something else and I
48:23 do
48:24 freelancing good question um I mean you
48:28 can definitely do freelancing um there
48:30 are different ways of how to transition
48:32 into freelancing um some people do I
48:34 call it the weekend freelancer that say
48:37 hey let me test the waters and you they
48:40 usually do it with those online
48:41 freelancing platforms because they are
48:42 small projects on them they only get
48:45 that small picture of how fre of how the
48:48 whole freelancing world is um because
48:51 they only spend a short like a small
48:52 amount of time but at least they um they
48:55 can have very good experiences and find
48:58 uh some attractive weekend projects um
49:01 uh on there then there's the basically
49:04 the transitioning phase where people say
49:06 hey I have a part-time job I I need a
49:10 additional income so of course they have
49:12 more time to dedicate
49:14 freelancing um there's the fulltime jump
49:18 into the cold water the plunge that I
49:19 did basically and there are people that
49:23 basically um try to hustle their way and
49:27 and uh every time their work is off they
49:29 have an extra hour they try to get a
49:31 client and they try to build this
49:34 freelancing gig up uh on the site until
49:37 they say hey it's enough so I can cover
49:40 my bills and now I will equip my job and
49:42 I'll move into so there are different
49:44 ways that lead to Rome um one some are
49:47 more dangerous than
49:51 others okay yeah thank you and dangerous
49:54 in the sense that like some body can
49:56 notice that
49:57 you're kind of trying to work two jobs
50:00 at the same time
50:01 right I mean I don't know I mean that's
50:04 probably depends on the contract you
50:05 have with the first company
50:08 um I might okay not be okay right okay
50:12 that that's a problem I don't have
50:13 anymore
50:14 so but also could be like health related
50:18 right because
50:20 like it's difficult to work like if you
50:23 do your work properly it's like 8 plus 8
50:27 hours per day or like I don't know in a
50:29 week it's 80 hours whatever way you
50:32 distribute this hours throughout the
50:34 week but then it's kind of difficult
50:37 for your brain to do all that right yeah
50:41 and uh specifically I mean we have to
50:43 think about why do people get into
50:45 freelancing the first place and for me
50:47 it was basically a little bit of
50:48 frustration on how data has been used uh
50:51 in different companies but also I always
50:54 had this let's say entrepreneurial urge
50:57 where I always want to be let's say My
50:58 Own Boss and have the freedom and free
51:01 time um again I have families in
51:03 different countries so I want to I don't
51:05 want to take off vacation days to visit
51:07 them I just want to go there and work
51:08 from their place and again so it's I
51:12 think getting into freelancing it starts
51:14 off with a purpose or motivation um it's
51:17 not always about getting rich fast or
51:20 something like this um it is definitely
51:23 um a way of how you can make a very nice
51:26 uh living but it's not guaranteed
51:28 because your your own business there's a
51:30 risk uh one mon one month you earn a lot
51:33 of money and you're very happy and very
51:35 proud the other month something happens
51:37 and everything is gone again and you
51:38 have to start from from the bottom up
51:40 again so again it's uh your your own
51:43 business and I think running a business
51:45 involves risk and everyone needs to kind
51:48 of be uh aware of that would it be
51:51 difficult for you personally
51:54 to just get a full-time job now with
51:57 this experience yes totally totally
52:00 because um the first year I was I mean
52:04 anxious can will I survive will I make
52:06 this work um and uh this year basically
52:11 my first son was born I took a fourm
52:14 month off uh on Parental leave and I was
52:18 and I basically stopped all my project
52:19 until then and I thought how is life
52:23 going to be when I am back basically and
52:25 I got back and I had tons of requests
52:28 again because I have good uh client
52:30 relationships um and I have so many
52:34 other ideas that I want to implement and
52:37 I feel like I don't know I always like
52:39 this example of when you learn something
52:43 new like this new mental mind map uh
52:47 kind of starts appearing it's like when
52:49 you used to play I don't know Super
52:51 Mario Brothers and now you finished one
52:53 level and now there's like a new whole
52:54 new Map opening up and you start from
52:57 level one and that's the same thing with
52:59 um being a freelancer because you do you
53:02 don't just work on your data skills and
53:04 delivering the data services but you do
53:06 marketing you do accounting um you do
53:10 different things uh and there's it's
53:13 never ending and it's basically a very F
53:15 I mean if you enjoy that part uh it's
53:17 very fulfilling and I couldn't imagine
53:20 being part of a company at least not for
53:24 now um there are many things that I want
53:25 to try out um that I enjoy and yeah MH
53:30 so the reason I ask this question is
53:32 like let's say I want to make this
53:35 liap and quit my job and then start
53:37 freelancing but then in the year I find
53:39 out that you know it's not going it's
53:42 not working the way I imagined then I
53:45 guess like you kind of still don't lose
53:48 the
53:49 skills you get extra ones like
53:52 marketing um and like accounting that
53:55 but then you can still go get back to
53:57 fulltime job and what what you said is
54:00 like yeah I don't need that cuz even
54:03 after a four months break I still had
54:06 you still had a ton of requests right MH
54:09 yeah okay interesting but again maybe
54:12 for other people it's different if you
54:13 start out that's why when people want to
54:15 get into freelance and I always advise
54:17 them put money aside I when I started
54:20 out I put I think like uh I think I had
54:23 like around eight month that I gave
54:25 myself time oddd number but I told
54:27 myself eight month if if you don't make
54:29 any money by then then you have to get a
54:32 job again and uh yeah luckily I made it
54:36 work
54:39 and okay yeah I'm just looking at the
54:41 outline the things we wanted to talk
54:44 about and there
54:47 are there is one is typical
54:51 mistakes that maybe it's worth covering
54:54 too so what what are the typical
54:55 mistakes when people want to become a
54:58 freelancer or in general doing
55:00 freelancing I think they're in first of
55:03 all for the wrong reason again they have
55:07 expectation that they can earn a lot of
55:09 money and that's usually the number one
55:10 that I often hear and they maybe have I
55:13 mean I'm just want to point out some
55:15 cases that I've seen maybe they have a
55:17 PhD they feel they're very much educated
55:19 they have very good skills in a par in a
55:21 particular field and now just because
55:24 they have the skill they think they can
55:26 command high prices they don't know
55:27 anything about how they position
55:29 themselves as a freelancer how they have
55:31 to project line but they still think
55:33 that their their value is way they ask
55:36 way too much basically and then of
55:37 course there's this delusion where they
55:39 don't land any project and at the end
55:42 they blame it on upwork is a is a
55:45 platform where only um small projects
55:48 are or upwork has too many Freelancers
55:50 bidding on uh small uh on a small hourly
55:55 fee you know I cannot compete on this
55:56 level you
55:57 know again those people are in for the
56:00 wrong reason because they don't want to
56:01 understand the whole freelancing game so
56:03 that's uh usually the um the first uh
56:07 the first mistake that I see and I think
56:08 another very
56:10 um uh obvious uh mistake that I often
56:13 see is um generally uh positioning um I
56:17 want to be a freelancer um how do I
56:19 position myself do I uh want to focus on
56:22 a specific Niche on a specific problem
56:24 that I uh
56:25 that I want to solve or am I this
56:28 generalist that knows some things very
56:30 well out of different ways and I can
56:32 connect things but again I don't say one
56:34 way is better than the other way because
56:36 some people just say you always have to
56:38 find the niche that's not always true
56:40 it's really about the positioning so
56:41 even as a generalist you can find your
56:43 way into freelancing it's just the way
56:45 how you basically deliver yourself to
56:48 the client um what is the value that you
56:50 provide to them um because you have this
56:53 this spectrum of knowledge as a
56:55 generalist maybe you want to go in there
56:57 um at the beginning compete on price
57:00 compete on time to delivery do you want
57:02 to um give any guarantees to the client
57:06 um there are so many ways on how you can
57:08 compete it's not just price and uh your
57:11 offering really depends um who you talk
57:13 to who's your audience and all just
57:15 overall positioning that's something
57:17 that I see uh lots of other um
57:20 Freelancers that don't survive let's say
57:21 the first even first month um
57:26 how can I learn more about this
57:27 positioning is other resources or it's
57:31 just by you learn by doing I mean you
57:35 always learn by doing um especially the
57:37 hard way uh but that sometimes can take
57:39 too long um I was lucky that I uh am my
57:43 undergr uh studies study business and
57:45 marketing and where I learned a lot
57:46 about that but there are I think overall
57:49 different resources one could take first
57:51 of all uh I think there are some pretty
57:53 good online uh marketing courses um uh
57:58 one could take the problem is often
58:00 those people are also very much
58:01 motivated into technical data skills so
58:04 instead of investing their time in
58:05 business or marketing skills then they
58:07 prefer to do the uh cat gbt online
58:09 course or something like this prompt
58:11 engineering
58:13 um and uh there are I think lots of also
58:17 mentors to find out there um and yeah
58:21 even I myself I um run this newsletter
58:25 for Freelancers and I try to give advice
58:28 and I try to make sure that the advice
58:30 is always um very diverse uh not only on
58:34 finding clients but also on Mental
58:37 Health how to stay motivated um how to
58:40 organize your work and so on um yeah so
58:43 I think there's there's information out
58:45 there and there are probably also people
58:47 out there that want to help but I think
58:49 it starts with the mindset and the
58:50 purpose while you're in it and speaking
58:53 of skills what you mentioned is like if
58:56 you want to start freelancing you
58:59 shouldn't just focus on technical skills
59:02 on hard skills so to say I mean by hard
59:05 I mean like data analysis uh CH GPT
59:09 whatever like this sort of skills you
59:11 also need to think about in our example
59:14 it was posioning and this is a concept
59:16 for marketing so then it's a good idea
59:19 to go and get a marketing course right
59:21 yeah where they say like how do you
59:23 position in product on a market trade
59:26 yeah um just to name one because I I I
59:29 do them myself once in a while just uh
59:32 um to stay updated and there's like this
59:33 new uh online platform I think called
59:36 domestica uh out there um and they
59:40 basically have pretty nice online
59:43 courses now it's Black
59:44 Friday yeah domestica is the name
59:47 domestica and uh yeah you you can find
59:49 them and they have some online courses
59:51 for eight uh dollars or eight EUR uh and
59:55 I think there's one or two very good one
59:57 on positioning and um I've done one of
1:00:00 them um and I've done several ones in
1:00:03 the past so I always try to update
1:00:05 myself I like to also see who are the
1:00:07 instructors who do those um courses how
1:00:11 what type of business do they have how
1:00:12 do they position in themselves even
1:00:15 though they might be a completely
1:00:16 different industry they could be graphic
1:00:17 designer they could be I mean other
1:00:20 Industries
1:00:22 because I mean at the end we are
1:00:24 Freelancers and we all try to basically
1:00:26 be our own business MH yeah and so you
1:00:29 are the product you want to advertise
1:00:31 right
1:00:32 mhm okay that's all we have time for
