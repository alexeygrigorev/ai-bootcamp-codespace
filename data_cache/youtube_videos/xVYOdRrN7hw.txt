0:01 so welcome everyone
0:04 i'm excited to be here thanks integra
0:06 for joining me so this is the first day
0:08 of our data talks club summer marathon
0:11 so which is a conference but not really
0:13 a conference it's more like a bunch of
0:14 meetups so for two weeks
0:16 every day we'll have a small talk like a
0:20 small meet up
0:21 and today is the first day so the first
0:23 week we'll talk about different topics
0:26 in career in data and the next week
0:28 we'll talk about machine learning
0:30 production so this is the lineup we have
0:33 for this week
0:34 and uh so first today we are talking
0:37 with santiago about
0:39 um what transitions from software
0:41 engineering to machine learning then
0:44 tomorrow we'll talk with daliana about
0:46 getting a promotion in data science so
0:48 the talk will be the next level of your
0:50 data science career then we'll talk
0:53 about data engineering and how data
0:54 scientists can build their own data
0:56 pipelines
0:58 on thursday we'll talk about two
1:00 different roles big data engineer and
1:02 data scientist and what are the
1:03 difference between them
1:04 and we will end this week with a talk
1:06 about building a machining startup with
1:08 elena
1:10 and if you haven't registered for our
1:12 conference
1:13 there is a link a link in description
1:16 you can just go there
1:17 and you can sign up for the uh other
1:20 days and then finally uh subscribe to
1:23 our youtube channel to stay up to date
1:25 with
1:26 all our events and join our slack to
1:29 talk about different data topics
1:32 during today interview with santiago you
1:35 can ask any question you want
1:36 and for that please use a pinned link in
1:39 in the description in the live chat so
1:42 just click on this link
1:43 and ask any question you want and
1:47 yes santiago was kind enough to provide
1:50 10
1:50 copies of his course and here are the
1:53 winners of his course i will announce
1:54 this later but
1:56 thanks a lot for taking part and
1:57 congratulations on winning this course
2:01 and last but not least
2:04 this event is supported by many of our
2:07 partners by
2:08 eight of them uh thanks a lot for your
2:10 support
2:11 for uh helping us with organizing this
2:14 event for promoting it
2:16 and uh please go to our conference
2:18 website and check them out
2:20 all of them are doing really cool stuff
2:23 and that's all for the introduction and
2:27 now i should stop sharing my screen and
2:31 yeah santiago are you ready i am ready
2:35 okay so let's start
2:38 absolutely yes so today we'll talk about
2:41 career transitioning from software
2:43 engineering to machine learning
2:45 and we have a special guest today
2:46 santiago so santiago is a director
2:48 of computer vision solutions at levitas
2:52 and there he leads a small small team of
2:56 software engineers and machinery
2:57 engineers
2:58 santiago is computers is a computer
3:00 scientist who focuses on applied machine
3:02 learning
3:03 and you probably know santiago from his
3:05 twitter
3:07 on twitter he shares every day he shares
3:09 a lot of practical
3:10 uh things about machine learning
3:13 thanks satiago for joining us today
3:15 welcome thank you for inviting me
3:18 yeah um before we go into our main topic
3:21 of moving from software engineering to
3:23 machine learning
3:24 um maybe we can start with your
3:25 background can you tell us about your
3:27 career journey so far
3:29 absolutely so i started as a software
3:32 developer
3:32 i went to college got a computer science
3:34 degree and i started building software
3:37 and i think it was 2015 when i decided
3:41 to go for a master's in computer science
3:43 and
3:44 you know back then i had no idea about
3:46 machine learning i didn't have any
3:48 interest
3:49 it was during the masters that i decided
3:51 to focus
3:52 more on machine learning and i know
3:54 you've been using the word transitioning
3:56 from software engineering to machine
3:57 learning
3:58 i like more the word adding
4:02 to my skill set the machine learning
4:05 skills because i think
4:07 if you're a software engineer you are
4:08 already providing a lot of value
4:11 by incorporating machine learning now
4:14 what you're doing is augmenting the
4:16 impact that you can have on the industry
4:18 so that's basically
4:19 a short description of how i went about
4:23 it it was through my master's i started
4:25 working more on machine learning
4:26 started getting more responsibilities on
4:28 that area
4:30 up to today where i'm mostly focused on
4:33 on that area yeah and
4:37 i am following you on twitter and i
4:38 noticed that recently you posted a
4:40 picture from a local
4:42 uh from your youth from i think from
4:44 cuba like it was a
4:46 picture of a newsletter using newspaper
4:48 yeah so you're from cuba originally
4:50 right
4:51 i am from cuba yeah i came here to
4:53 united states
4:54 back in 2009 may 1st
4:58 2009 so i've been here for 12 years now
5:02 yeah okay yeah so you you got here
5:06 you you did your bachelor's in there so
5:08 i did yeah i did my bachelor's
5:10 uh in cuba was computer science and then
5:12 i
5:14 went through my master's here in the
5:15 states uh it was georgia tech
5:17 their online master's program which is
5:20 fantastic
5:21 yeah yeah i think i saw it also from i
5:23 think i know
5:25 like because you post so much on twitter
5:27 so i already uh
5:29 know this video as well i think in this
5:31 picture that you shared from cuba
5:33 it was two guys like you and your friend
5:36 you were
5:36 staying at the computer and your comment
5:40 was that you didn't have any internet
5:41 connection back then so you just
5:43 yeah back then i think the first time we
5:45 saw internet uh
5:46 in my during my my college degree or my
5:50 you know my didn't i i think it was 2000
5:53 maybe 2001
5:55 that was the first time that we got
5:56 access to internet so back then it was
5:58 about
5:59 having a couple of books and that was it
6:02 and the knowledge that we shared
6:04 was you know month to month that you
6:06 know you had to talk to people
6:08 if you wanted to know something that you
6:10 didn't know uh so that it was
6:12 very different to you know the way it is
6:15 today that you can find
6:17 so much information online literally
6:19 anything that you want to know is going
6:20 to be online in some
6:22 form so yeah definitely very different
6:25 yeah i see why you
6:26 love books oh yeah that's exactly that's
6:29 exactly why i love
6:30 books yeah for sure yeah so
6:34 you mentioned that you don't like to
6:36 think
6:37 from uh like when i say transitioning
6:40 from software engineering to machine
6:41 learning
6:42 you said that you don't like this word
6:44 transitioning because you didn't really
6:46 transition
6:47 you just added machine learning to your
6:50 skill set as a software engineer
6:52 right so um do you think that software
6:55 engineers are already qualified for
6:57 doing machine learning
6:58 i do i actually so this is this is what
7:01 i think right one of the hardest skills
7:03 for you to get and uh and start
7:06 providing value
7:07 in the machine learning field is
7:09 precisely coding is your ability to
7:12 develop solutions right to
7:14 your ability to make the computer do
7:16 what you want
7:17 that's one of the hardest skills that
7:19 you can build so if you're a software
7:21 engineer if you already
7:22 have that skill you're definitely
7:25 halfway home
7:26 you're you definitely have what's needed
7:28 to be successful
7:30 in a machine learning field it's
7:32 interesting that most
7:33 people are afraid of their math but what
7:36 i've seen is that
7:37 most people that are that don't continue
7:40 that are left behind
7:42 it's not because they lack math skills
7:44 it's because they lack
7:46 coding skills so yeah if you were to ask
7:49 who's better position to be successful
7:53 um you know not of 10 time i'm gonna
7:55 pick the person who already knows how to
7:57 develop software and provide value
7:59 through software for sure
8:01 yeah so software engineers are basically
8:04 already qualified for this work
8:06 oh yeah they just need to convince
8:08 themselves that math is not
8:10 the most it's not that scary it's not
8:12 that scary you know
8:14 yeah math you're gonna need math and
8:16 yeah the deeper you go
8:17 math is gonna become more important but
8:20 uh but
8:20 but it's not that scary i promise you if
8:23 you have the skills to build
8:25 software you can have a huge impact
8:29 just with those skills and a little bit
8:31 more math that you're gonna incorporate
8:33 as you go yeah for sure yes
8:37 but how do we as software engineers how
8:40 do we convince ourselves that
8:42 math is not scary because i remember
8:46 um when i was studying machine learning
8:48 uh i remember
8:49 that like all these formulas like
8:52 especially when you talk
8:54 when you talk about more difficult
8:55 concepts like support vector machines
8:58 like you have these crazy formulas like
9:00 crazy or maybe somebody who
9:02 who studies math who disagree that it's
9:04 crazy like they would say
9:05 yeah it's just first level life thrust
9:07 great uh calculus whatever
9:09 but when i look at this it's scary so
9:12 how do
9:12 i convince myself that it's not scary
9:15 that i shouldn't worry about this thing
9:17 yeah i think it's a great question so
9:18 number one we have to think about the
9:21 way machine learning content has been
9:23 uh or or who's sharing that machine
9:26 learning content
9:27 mostly and if you think about it it's
9:29 mostly coming from academia right it's
9:31 papers
9:32 is the people who invented those
9:34 formulas are writing books and are
9:36 recording youtube videos and obviously
9:39 it's really hard when you
9:40 get to to a blog post and you cannot get
9:43 past the second paragraph because there
9:45 is a huge formula right there at the
9:47 beginning right
9:49 that is it's i i have to these are like
9:51 the hope
9:52 that that's gonna get better over time
9:54 i'm working on it a bunch of people are
9:56 working on it
9:57 trying to share the other side of
9:59 machine learning
10:00 which is a very different approach to
10:02 understand and
10:04 to learn how to make progress in the
10:06 field like instead of starting with
10:08 how the thing is built it's you start
10:11 with
10:11 what can you use and how you can use
10:13 this concept
10:14 to solve that problem so it's a very
10:17 different approach
10:18 you know think about when you go to
10:20 school and they teach you about a bunch
10:22 of
10:22 physics and chemistry and math just
10:25 because it's just like sort of like a
10:27 general foundation that maybe you're
10:28 gonna need later
10:29 maybe you will not need later uh
10:33 that has pros it also bores a lot of
10:36 people a lot of people start there and
10:37 they don't know where they're going
10:38 but you know they go through so much
10:40 math content that
10:41 they don't know why is this gonna be
10:43 useful another approach is to start with
10:46 problems another approach is
10:47 for you to look at a problem and say
10:49 what do i need in order to solve that
10:51 problem
10:52 and yes i know that a lot of people say
10:54 well you cannot use something
10:55 effectively
10:56 unless you know how how that thing is
11:00 working and i understand there is just a
11:02 spectrum right
11:04 you can know very very low level details
11:07 of how
11:08 uh how it works internally or you might
11:10 know just the necessary
11:12 things that it does in order to solve
11:14 the problem like not everyone that sort
11:16 in a list
11:17 right now knows exactly how the
11:19 algorithm works i know
11:21 extremely effective python programmers
11:24 that don't even know that the sorting
11:26 behind python is called team sword
11:29 they have no idea they they can still
11:31 sort lists
11:32 right now the other person will tell you
11:35 but if there is something wrong with
11:36 sword they will not
11:37 sure when when that happens they can go
11:40 and dive deeper and get the knowledge
11:42 they need to understand how
11:43 team sort works but i don't think
11:46 everyone needs to start from the nuts
11:49 and bolts
11:50 of the content i think you could also
11:52 start from the beginning trying to make
11:54 an
11:54 impact that's what like things like
11:56 automl is doing right
11:58 they're providing tools that you can use
12:01 without the need of having somebody that
12:03 knows the calculus that goes behind the
12:05 scenes i think that's
12:06 it's a it's a different approach and
12:09 it's something that you're going to see
12:10 more and more as time goes on for sure
12:13 and also to add to your uh analogy of
12:16 knowing sorting how many times it
12:19 happens that your sorting algorithm
12:21 doesn't work and has it ever happened to
12:23 you that sourcing
12:24 no never never yeah yeah and by the way
12:28 i'm not talking about
12:29 not understanding sorting at all it's a
12:31 good idea i'm saying
12:33 there it's a spectrum right so how much
12:35 you understand about sorting
12:37 will definitely help you if you know
12:39 more might be helpful for you that's
12:41 okay but
12:41 you cannot limit people just because
12:44 they don't know is team sword
12:45 you should not limit them on what they
12:48 can accomplish
12:50 you shouldn't guard them from the
12:52 computer and say absolutely yeah like
12:55 no don't touch the keyboard until you
12:56 can show me like all the properties of
12:58 the team sort right
12:59 yeah yeah like for example i've been
13:02 posting a lot of content on twitter on
13:04 usually the approach that i take is
13:07 how much jargon i can remove from this
13:10 content so more people understand what's
13:12 happening right so if i'm going to talk
13:14 about
13:14 let's say i just posted a tweet last
13:17 week about ensembl
13:18 learning and when you read the topic
13:22 online there is so much
13:23 so much jargon and things that you
13:26 need to know in order to even understand
13:29 why an ensemble work
13:31 so my challenge is how do i remove all
13:33 of that and
13:34 and still make it accessible to more
13:37 people that they might not be ready to
13:39 maybe to build and ensemble but they
13:42 will understand it's a tool that they
13:43 can pick up they understand that it's
13:45 valuable they understand that the
13:47 situations where to use it
13:49 and i think more and more you're gonna
13:51 see more and more of that content coming
13:54 uh because more people are gonna want to
13:55 use machine learning and apply it to
13:58 their use cases so i think i think
14:00 that's a good thing
14:02 yeah and yeah it's a good thing that
14:04 you're doing on twitter because
14:06 you have this ability to
14:09 put complex things in simple terms and
14:12 i agree with everything you say so to me
14:15 it's like you're just
14:17 sometimes i feel like you can read my
14:19 mind and just tweet it out
14:21 this is really great because i agree
14:22 with uh with
14:25 almost everything you say so this is
14:26 cool thanks for doing this
14:28 and how do you actually go about this
14:30 removing jargon because i think uh
14:33 even though it's not super related to
14:34 the topic today i think it's uh
14:36 interesting uh like how how it is
14:39 possible to
14:41 um like these are complex terms uh
14:44 complex things like
14:45 ensemble learning so how do you make it
14:47 accessible for people
14:50 yeah i think uh it's this goes more into
14:53 writing and what would i do but just
14:55 just as a
14:56 sort of like a way to answer the
14:58 question is so i write down
15:00 sort of like an outline of what i want
15:02 to explain
15:03 and then i use my wife as my guinea pig
15:07 can you understand what's happening here
15:09 right
15:10 and she usually points out terms
15:13 that to me are very clear
15:16 but to but have no meaning to her right
15:20 so that helps me a lot and usually also
15:23 asking the question
15:24 can a six-year-old understand what i'm
15:26 trying to put here and you know what
15:28 sometimes you can't do it
15:30 but it's all it's always about trying a
15:33 little bit harder
15:34 and sort of like getting the feedback
15:36 from the people who read that thread who
15:38 read that content that
15:39 what questions do they ask does it help
15:42 them
15:43 until like incorporating that feedback
15:45 in your next thread so
15:46 this is usually a battle and it's
15:49 usually also a spectrum of
15:50 how easy can you make something before
15:53 it doesn't make sense anymore right like
15:55 if you try to make it so
15:56 easier then you're not helping anyone
15:59 but if you make it too complex then
16:00 you're
16:01 you know living out everyone else so
16:03 yeah you know
16:04 it's usually a battle but it's a nice
16:06 battle to fight it's something
16:08 that i enjoy for sure yeah thanks
16:11 so uh speaking of petra so just before
16:14 this
16:15 uh this conversation today i opened
16:18 twitter just wanted to check
16:21 what you've been up to and i noticed
16:23 this nice thread
16:25 which is very on topic for today's
16:26 conversation which is about seven
16:28 lessons
16:29 i learned about starting a career in
16:31 machine learning
16:32 do you remember what are these seven
16:34 lessons i can
16:36 have it in front of me right now i
16:38 remember
16:39 some of them uh
16:42 yeah i think i have it right here
16:46 so yeah maybe you can walk us through a
16:48 bit these lessons because i think
16:50 these are very useful for uh software
16:53 engineers who want to transition today
16:55 yeah absolutely so first of all the
16:57 context uh
16:58 this is trying to do a little bit of a
17:01 retrospective
17:03 myself and how do i how did i get into
17:05 the field
17:06 the things that i learned and also about
17:09 this year of uh of you know it's been a
17:12 year now that i've
17:14 focused a lot on helping people get into
17:16 the field right
17:18 so just looking at the questions they
17:19 ask looking at the problems they
17:21 they've had uh what can we learn from
17:24 that right so the first lesson
17:26 is it applies to to a bunch of different
17:30 things not only machine learning is that
17:32 most people
17:33 really enjoy the the idea of studying
17:35 something new
17:36 unfortunately they fail to take the
17:39 first step
17:40 right it's like you know you decide that
17:42 you want to make a change in your life
17:44 you want to go to the gym
17:46 and you start buying supplements and you
17:48 start buying shorts and shoes and that
17:50 process
17:51 really is exciting but you never
17:54 show up you never go to the gym right so
17:58 so like uh the lesson here is don't
18:00 don't be
18:01 like that person right don't don't
18:03 prepare you don't need that much
18:04 preparation right
18:06 you just need to take the first step you
18:07 just need to do something today that
18:10 gets you a little bit closer to that job
18:12 i think that's the first lesson
18:13 it's like buying a course about machine
18:16 learning and getting excited hey
18:18 now i will finish this course this is
18:20 how much i will know and then you come
18:21 across the second one
18:23 but this is even cooler let's have this
18:25 one as well and then there is a third
18:27 one and there is a cool free course
18:29 and then there is a book somebody
18:30 recommends you and you all wonder
18:32 you want to get all of them right but at
18:34 the end you just collect
18:36 resources and you don't do anything
18:40 that is exactly right it is
18:44 it is you know most people spend so much
18:47 time
18:47 trying to find the best course
18:50 trying to find the best tutorial the
18:53 best video
18:54 and there is no best tutorial there is
18:56 no best course it's
18:58 while whatever you have in your
18:59 bookmarks is plenty enough so
19:01 go through that and then decide what's
19:03 going to be better for you but just stop
19:05 preparing just you just need to take the
19:07 first
19:08 the first step so yeah so the second
19:10 lesson it's basically
19:12 learning is a marathon not a spring
19:14 right
19:15 i get a lot of questions of people
19:17 asking me hey can i
19:19 become an expert in a few weeks or
19:22 in a year or in a month or the reality
19:26 is that machine learning no different
19:27 than
19:28 any other field it's a life long
19:31 journey right so if if what you're
19:34 trying you know machine learning has
19:35 been
19:36 has been selected for the last few years
19:37 as the sexiest
19:39 field to be in and stuff like that
19:42 and then people want to be to to get
19:45 into the field
19:46 because they think it's a shortcut to
19:48 sex or they
19:49 think they're gonna be making a lot of
19:51 money or they right
19:53 that mentality i don't see
19:56 helping right so instead if you're
19:58 coming in
19:59 understand what you're setting yourself
20:02 up to right
20:03 understand that this is a lifelong
20:05 journey it's a field that moves
20:07 really really fast and you're gonna have
20:09 to keep up right and you're gonna have
20:11 to
20:11 dedicate a lot of time to become good at
20:13 it so it's just setting the right
20:15 expectations
20:16 uh for you to start to start in the
20:19 field so
20:20 that's the second one yeah there is no
20:23 yeah there is no magic and there is no
20:25 shortcuts uh it is
20:27 it is it is hard it is it's super
20:30 rewarding
20:31 it's easy to start but it's gonna be a
20:33 lifelong
20:34 effort for sure uh yeah so lesson number
20:38 three
20:39 it's basically a proverb that i used it
20:43 there which is if you want to go
20:44 quickly go alone if you want to go
20:48 far go together and here the idea is
20:52 that
20:52 the people that i've seen that have made
20:56 most progress are always part
20:59 of a community are always part of a
21:02 group it's
21:02 really hard to make progress when you
21:05 are alone
21:06 right so find
21:09 like-minded people that want to take
21:11 this journey with you right
21:13 there is a huge online community online
21:15 machine learning community
21:17 just try to be there with them right
21:20 try to join try to find other people
21:23 that want to bounce
21:24 ideas off of you
21:27 and vice versa try to find people that
21:29 are taking the same classes as you are
21:31 and that will boost your odds
21:34 significantly right you're gonna make
21:36 a ton of progress just because of that
21:39 in my case
21:41 my my teaching is a way for me or is
21:44 is one of the most powerful ways i have
21:47 to learn
21:48 right so i come here and not only i'm
21:50 not only writing about stuff that i know
21:53 a bunch of stuff that i've i've gone to
21:55 twitter and talked about on twitter is
21:56 stuff that i don't know
21:58 what i'm talking about right i just read
22:00 about that and i
22:01 you know the process of writing about it
22:04 is the way that i learn right and that's
22:06 thanks to the community that's going to
22:08 give me feedback that's going to
22:09 challenge my ideas
22:11 that's extremely important if you're
22:13 trying to get into the field for sure
22:15 yeah okay okay so lesson number four
22:19 if you finish a course and the only
22:22 thing you have to show for it
22:24 is here is inside your head you probably
22:26 wasted your time
22:28 right and here the idea is you have to
22:30 do stuff
22:32 not only just consume information you
22:35 have to produce
22:36 something right so if you're watching a
22:38 tutorial
22:39 do something with it if you're reading a
22:41 book stop after the first chapter and
22:44 think
22:44 how can i apply what i learned if you
22:47 don't do that
22:47 unfortunately you are going to forget
22:50 even if the
22:51 doing means going to twitter and talking
22:54 about it that is doing that's the
22:55 act of taking that knowledge and
22:58 applying it somehow that is extremely
23:01 extremely important right if you're not
23:04 doing stuff with the knowledge that
23:05 you're acquiring
23:06 the knowledge is going to you know it's
23:09 not going to
23:10 to stay for long for sure yeah yeah
23:13 yeah so you were saying that uh so
23:15 you're writing about this
23:17 ensemble methods and you would test what
23:20 you wrote on your wife
23:21 so i guess this is a great example of
23:23 how you can actually
23:24 when you learn something when you study
23:26 something try to
23:28 teach the other or some other person
23:30 about this
23:32 talk to your wife or somebody and
23:35 if they understand then this is a lot
23:37 better than just
23:38 reading uh closing your book and uh not
23:41 doing anything
23:43 yeah one thing that i've been doing is i
23:45 have now that twitter supports twitter
23:47 spaces so basically you
23:49 you get the microphone and a bunch of
23:50 people join you and you can get to talk
23:52 to a bunch of people
23:54 so i've done twitter spaces to talk
23:55 about a topic that i just learned
23:57 just so i can explain it to someone else
23:59 and a bunch of people join and they ask
24:01 me questions and
24:02 they test what i learned right so i have
24:04 to get prepared to do that and that
24:06 preparation forces me
24:08 to solidify that learning to understand
24:11 a little bit better so that's extremely
24:13 powerful is it a regular thing you do on
24:15 this twitter spaces
24:17 what's that is it regular thinking that
24:19 you do do you do this
24:20 so i've been doing it very regularly so
24:23 usually per week i do it once uh
24:25 sometimes i join somebody else's space
24:27 and i talk about the stuff that i'm
24:28 learning on or
24:29 whatever somebody i do my own or
24:32 sometimes i do my own space
24:34 uh and talk about a specific topic do
24:36 you have like a specific time frame when
24:37 you do this or you just
24:39 when you feel like uh you just tweet it
24:41 out yeah
24:42 it's when i so i was doing one every
24:44 weekend but then after that is is
24:46 whenever i have the time to join i
24:48 i try to do it yeah okay so yeah so
24:50 let's follow you
24:51 right let's see to follow you to know
24:54 when you're
24:55 doing this yeah you have to you have to
24:56 stay tuned yeah for sure
24:59 yeah so the fifth lesson on that thread
25:02 is uh people think about math every time
25:04 machine learning comes up
25:06 uh and then i say i think they're
25:08 missing the point right
25:09 so i do not believe machine learning is
25:13 more math than coding i do believe like
25:16 i look back at my masters
25:17 and we were a lot of people were taking
25:20 the machine learning class
25:21 and most of us were really scared about
25:23 the math
25:24 because everyone is you know unless you
25:27 have a math background everyone is
25:28 scared about the math
25:29 it turns out that by the end of the
25:31 class the people who didn't make it
25:34 uh didn't make it because of their
25:36 coding skills they were not
25:38 able to translate the ideas
25:41 into code they failed to do that that
25:43 was really hard
25:44 uh that was the actual the hardest part
25:46 of the class so
25:49 when i work every day that i get to meet
25:51 people i get to talk to other teammates
25:54 the ones that struggle the most are the
25:57 ones that are not capable
25:58 of building solutions yes analysis is
26:02 super important yes i do believe
26:04 analysis
26:04 is better than code especially when
26:07 you're studying
26:08 your ability to analyze a problem and
26:10 understand what needs to happen
26:12 it's it's crucial but at some point you
26:14 have to deliver value and that is
26:16 through code so
26:18 i think math is extremely important but
26:20 it shouldn't be the thing that scares
26:22 you
26:22 out of the field uh it's just it's just
26:25 a thing that you're gonna have to learn
26:27 but it doesn't it's not that scary i
26:29 promise you so that's
26:30 the fifth place you already have a bunch
26:32 of questions about improving coding but
26:34 i think
26:34 we should come back to that a bit late
26:37 when we finish
26:38 this lesson yeah two more lessons to go
26:41 uh
26:41 i already mentioned this one here but
26:43 his coding is secondary your ability to
26:45 analyze a problem is the most important
26:46 skill you can build and this seems a
26:48 little bit
26:49 counter uh narrative was serious
26:52 right but it's so so think about it this
26:55 way when you're studying
26:56 right this skill that i want you to
26:58 build is the ability to read a problem
27:01 and understand analyze how to solve that
27:04 that's the skill that i want you to
27:05 build
27:06 this is not to say that overall as an
27:08 engineer coding is secondary this is as
27:11 you study now
27:13 assuming that you already have knowledge
27:15 about how to code
27:16 i want you to put that aside i don't
27:19 want you to focus
27:20 on grab that code from stack overflow or
27:22 or
27:23 i don't want you to focus on that i want
27:25 you to focus on understanding the
27:26 problem i want that's a muscle
27:28 and i want you to exercise that specific
27:32 muscle
27:32 after you know what needs to be done
27:36 now you can focus on the coding part now
27:38 you can grab the code from stack
27:39 overflow from the book or from the
27:41 tutorial that you that you're reading
27:43 first understand the you know problems
27:47 understand different possible solutions
27:50 how to pick a model
27:51 how to you know do the error analysis
27:54 all of that i think that's that's
27:55 very very important for to build to
27:58 store
27:58 in a machine learning uh career how how
28:02 can somebody actually pick up this skill
28:05 is it just work or there is i think it's
28:09 so it starts by you putting the code
28:11 aside and
28:12 not focusing on that if you start with a
28:14 problem
28:15 most of us this is the way i've built my
28:17 entire career i find a problem and then
28:19 i go online and find somebody else that
28:21 solved it
28:21 and see how they solved it right some
28:24 people
28:25 think that that's cheating well that's
28:26 that's my entire career if somebody else
28:28 did it
28:29 i'm gonna use what that person did for
28:31 sure right so it's putting that aside
28:33 i'm forcing myself to
28:35 think through the possible solutions
28:37 right it's more about consuming the
28:39 content and trying to apply those ideas
28:41 unless about
28:42 finding a library that does the work or
28:45 finding somebody else that coded it
28:46 right
28:47 just forcing myself to think through
28:49 what are the ideas why is this solution
28:51 the one that i should pick
28:53 right it's trying to just dig a little
28:55 bit deeper in the books
28:56 dig a little bit deeper in the math at
28:59 the beginning
29:00 just so i can build that foundation
29:03 yeah and finally uh lesson number seven
29:06 this is a quote uh it says you have to
29:09 understand every detail of an algorithm
29:12 if you want to use it and then i i say
29:15 i think this is advice i do not
29:18 believe you have to understand
29:20 the nuts and bolts of every algorithm
29:22 before you use it
29:24 it's nice if you do don't think for a
29:27 minute that's the only way to build
29:28 systems right
29:30 i use uh i've been using neural networks
29:32 for the longest time
29:34 and i do have a sense of how gradient
29:36 descent works
29:37 i cannot explain it to you right now i
29:40 will have to go and check
29:41 back and to actually get a better
29:44 intuition
29:45 and that doesn't mean that i cannot
29:46 solve things using neural networks right
29:49 so uh trying to force people to
29:53 well there's you're not gonna be
29:54 successful unless you can explain
29:57 every single detail of how this works it
29:59 goes back to our sorting example
30:01 i think that's just advice i
30:03 think it's not
30:04 that's not the way the world works uh as
30:07 an engineer
30:08 i've worked on many many systems and
30:10 i've used many many things that i do not
30:12 i understand what
30:13 impact they have i do not understand uh
30:16 the nuts and bolts of how it works so
30:18 yeah that's that's the final lesson on
30:21 that thread
30:22 the funny thing is like when i think
30:23 about all these libraries like circuit
30:25 learn
30:27 the algorithm they use inside to
30:29 implement this uh
30:30 for example logistic regression or
30:32 something else are not the same
30:34 as the algorithms we study in machine
30:37 learning classes in machine learning
30:38 classes we
30:40 learn something simpler right but then
30:43 when it comes to executive
30:44 implementation
30:45 this is like a super optimized version
30:48 completely different from what we study
30:50 so even if we try to
30:52 you know learn and get all these basics
30:55 of
30:56 uh machine learning at the end the
30:58 algorithm that
30:59 these libraries use is different right
31:01 so yeah absolutely there's
31:03 you know i think we need a lot more
31:05 pragmatism
31:06 in the industry right a lot more
31:10 making impacts right or focusing on
31:13 delivering value
31:14 and a little bit less of purism or oh
31:18 you can't do this unless you know all of
31:20 these right it's
31:21 it's sort of like a the mentality that
31:22 just gatekeeping right
31:24 yes you know i get it i i get that
31:28 you've worked really really hard
31:30 getting your degrees and your fancy
31:32 titles and all of your knowledge but
31:34 it's it's time for everyone you know to
31:36 join as well even though they don't have
31:38 those right yeah
31:40 yeah and if you think again about
31:43 a business where you work let's say they
31:46 want to
31:47 predict something simple like if this
31:49 user will click on this ad
31:51 right and then if you manage
31:54 to increase this click-through rate
31:58 nobody from the leadership team will
32:00 care if you know math or not
32:02 right as long as you actually manage to
32:05 improve this
32:06 click-through rate or something else
32:08 it's more about impact not uh
32:10 yeah absolutely not if you know details
32:13 yeah by the way there are two different
32:15 paths and i usually speak
32:17 to those that want to work in the
32:19 industry that want to
32:21 you know have their impact there there
32:23 is a path for
32:24 researchers and that is completely
32:26 different and i
32:28 do not dare to speak about that because
32:30 i don't know i don't have any experience
32:32 with that
32:32 but right there outside in the industry
32:35 pragmatism
32:36 goes a long way for sure yeah
32:40 yeah we had a comment that uh feels more
32:42 like
32:43 a motivational speech than talking about
32:44 transitioning so maybe
32:47 there we go it is a good motivational
32:50 speech but maybe
32:51 we can go to the actual uh you know
32:54 the actual stuff so one of the things i
32:58 wanted to ask you and i still i
33:00 i i'm taking a note to talk about
33:02 becoming better at coding
33:04 but first let's cover so we have a
33:07 couple of things
33:08 um so let's start with core tools and
33:11 frameworks that we need to learn to
33:12 actually
33:13 transition so let's say i am a software
33:15 engineer
33:16 i know how to program uh but say i know
33:19 java
33:20 right uh i know sql i know how to use
33:22 gita i know
33:23 bash maybe i know docker all these
33:25 things
33:27 and i hear about machine learning it
33:28 seems like a cool thing
33:30 so what are the core tools and
33:33 frameworks so
33:34 yes and i watch this video i get
33:36 convinced that i don't need to
33:38 get deep into math i want to start
33:41 coding
33:41 and get my hands dirty so what are the
33:44 core tools and frameworks i need to
33:46 learn to do this
33:47 yeah absolutely great question so i
33:49 think number one you should start
33:51 learning a little bit of python since
33:53 you already know java i don't think
33:54 there's gonna be a huge transition for
33:56 you it's gonna be very simple
33:58 not because python is is the same as
34:00 java but you know
34:01 in a week you're gonna get a lot of the
34:04 the differences there right you're gonna
34:05 be able
34:06 to to make some progress so that's
34:07 number one then you get
34:09 uh certain core tools they're gonna be
34:12 using throughout your entire career and
34:13 those would be
34:14 like numpy for scientific computing
34:17 that's a library and pandas for data
34:19 manipulation
34:21 and i don't know maplo lip on seabourn
34:24 and fluffy those three or
34:26 one of those three for shouting and
34:28 displaying
34:29 graphics and then you get psychic learn
34:31 for a collection of machine learning
34:33 algorithms so those
34:34 are tools that you're gonna have to be
34:35 using i do not recommend just to go and
34:38 learn about them just
34:40 out of the the blue right instead i
34:43 would recommend you to go to maybe
34:44 kaggle or maybe take a course online and
34:46 we can talk about specific courses for
34:48 sure
34:50 take one of those courses that is going
34:51 to start introducing you to some
34:53 problems
34:54 and to some core ideas of machine
34:56 learning there is a
34:57 course in kaggle which is an
35:00 introduction to
35:01 i don't remember the name but if you go
35:02 to cattle they have tutorials there for
35:04 free
35:05 and one of them is an introductory uh
35:07 course
35:08 that takes you through the titanic
35:10 problem in kaggle one of the
35:12 most famous competitions there and
35:14 what's good about it is that the only
35:15 requirement for you is to know
35:17 python they're going to present a
35:19 problem and tell you how to use decision
35:21 trees to solve that specific problem
35:24 and i think that process is extremely
35:27 powerful
35:28 because you go from no machine learning
35:30 background
35:31 to understand what the problem is
35:34 why you cannot solve it with what you
35:37 know right now which is
35:38 straight software engineering practices
35:41 why you need something like a decision
35:42 tree how to build it
35:45 how to apply it how to get results so
35:48 that line there is exactly what i
35:50 recommend people to start getting into
35:52 the industry first
35:53 understand why you will need this right
35:56 find a problem that you cannot solve by
35:58 yourself understand how you can solve it
36:00 and then start getting deeper
36:02 later on you can get into decision trees
36:04 and understand
36:06 all of the nuts and bolts behind the
36:08 scenes and all of the math and all of
36:10 the cool stuff
36:11 but at the beginning just learning how
36:13 to use it
36:14 is extremely powerful for sure so yeah
36:16 that's what i would do
36:18 yeah yeah so this um comes back to one
36:22 of your
36:22 uh tweets uh or maybe it was from your
36:25 course
36:26 when you compare two approaches to
36:28 learning so one approach is
36:29 problem-based approach which you just uh
36:32 talked about so you find a problem and
36:34 um in this case it was some problem from
36:37 uh kaggle about uh state athenic dataset
36:40 and you just learn how to solve this
36:43 problem using this specific tool
36:44 decision trees from scikit-learn right
36:46 and then there is another approach
36:48 which i think you call top-down approach
36:50 which where you start
36:52 from math then you learn first math
36:56 all linear algebra calculus but not then
36:59 when you know the math you go to machine
37:00 learning theory
37:02 you learn the theory and then four times
37:05 four four years later you finally come
37:08 to applications and then okay how do i
37:11 use all these four years of math to
37:13 solve
37:14 this titanic problem right so
37:17 here you kind of save yourself this time
37:21 i think yeah and again i i don't want to
37:24 get into the is this better than this
37:26 if you ask me my opinion i i would
37:29 rather prefer if i have an electrical
37:31 outlet here that i need replacing i
37:33 don't want to go to college spend four
37:35 years understanding the math behind
37:37 electricity and the physics and all of
37:38 that just to change an outlet
37:40 i would rather start with the outlet
37:42 find a youtube video that helps me go
37:44 through the problem
37:45 and if i'm interested then i can go
37:47 deeper a little bit and understand why
37:49 if i toss
37:50 the you know the positive one it's gonna
37:53 just
37:53 electrocute me or whatever bad analogy
37:56 but you get the idea right i
37:57 really like the idea of starting with a
37:59 problem
38:00 uh trying to throw what i know to that
38:04 problem and understand why it doesn't
38:06 work
38:06 and then grab the tools that i need to
38:09 solve that problem
38:10 and start digging deeper and deeper and
38:12 deeper from that point on that's
38:14 that's an approach that it worked for me
38:16 very well and i've seen work for
38:18 many many people as well so yeah that's
38:20 that's what i usually recommend
38:23 so maybe we can talk a bit about
38:25 learning resources so you mentioned one
38:26 you mentioned cargo
38:27 so there is a introduction introduction
38:30 tutorial where you can get and learn how
38:32 to apply decision trees
38:34 in at the beginning before we started
38:37 this interview today you mentioned a
38:38 couple of books as well
38:41 so maybe you can talk again about these
38:45 books and
38:46 mention some other courses that you
38:47 would recommend yeah
38:49 so if you're a developer a course that i
38:51 usually recommend
38:52 if you want to start and start quick is
38:54 uh is the crash course
38:56 from google so google created this crash
38:58 course
38:59 for their own employees and they
39:01 published the course online so it's
39:03 called machine learning crash course and
39:05 it's free
39:05 you don't need to register you don't
39:07 need to do anything you can just start
39:08 the only
39:09 requirement for that course is that you
39:11 know a little bit of python
39:13 uh so that's if you're a developer
39:15 that's a great starting point if you are
39:17 not a developer
39:18 then uh i do have on my twitter account
39:21 my pin twitter
39:22 if you go to my profile the tweet that's
39:24 gonna be on the top that says pin tweet
39:27 it's gonna give you a full roadmap
39:29 starting
39:30 with an introduction to python right so
39:32 if you're not even a developer you can
39:34 start with python
39:36 and work your way to more machine
39:39 learning right so
39:40 this roadmap is focused on coursera
39:44 which is a platform that i really really
39:46 like right
39:47 so you can audit all of the courses for
39:49 free or you can pay for
39:51 the coursera subscription to get
39:53 certificates if you want to
39:55 but it basically goes from introduction
39:57 to python to machine learning
39:59 deep learning tensorflow advanced
40:01 tensorflow
40:02 and machine learning operations there
40:04 are six courses there
40:05 they're gonna take a few years to go
40:07 through so every course is
40:08 specialization so it's gonna take you
40:11 several weeks to complete so we're
40:13 talking about a roadmap that's gonna
40:14 expand a year for sure
40:16 but again it's just a path if you want
40:19 one uh that's one
40:20 uh regarding books i do like
40:24 a couple of books specifically related
40:27 one of them is deep learning just uh
40:29 which is the deep learning with python
40:32 franchoi chalet is the the writer the
40:35 person who created keras
40:37 is the writer of that book by the way
40:39 the second edition of the book is about
40:41 to be released i'm really looking
40:44 forward to that one
40:45 the second book is this one here which
40:47 is hands-on
40:48 you know machine learning with psychic
40:50 learn keras and tensorflow
40:52 this is a book that you can read cover
40:54 to cover it's a book that you can start
40:55 from the beginning
40:57 and there is a lot of knowledge here so
40:58 you pairing this book with a course
41:01 it's you know you're going to maximize
41:03 the reward for sure so that's
41:05 that's a great way to start yeah okay
41:08 yeah so we i'm just looking at the
41:10 questions and the first question is the
41:12 most uh
41:13 question is what are your favorite books
41:16 uh so
41:17 these two do you have i think you have
41:19 something else on your
41:20 desk maybe you can also i do so i do
41:23 have so those two books
41:24 are the show the deep learning with
41:26 python and the hands-on machine learning
41:28 our technical books
41:30 uh non non-technical books is
41:33 a lot of the rings and you cannot see it
41:35 is huge book i have it
41:37 i think it's there they stick obviously
41:40 a lot of the rings
41:42 it's i have the spanish version there
41:44 and
41:45 like a self-help book i i'm really into
41:48 atomic habits
41:49 uh from james clear uh
41:52 this book by the way i i picked it up
41:55 recently
41:56 i realized that i've done a lot of the
41:58 stuff that's recommended on this book
42:00 uh i've done it but a lot of it is super
42:03 super good so i really recommend it to
42:05 21 for sure yeah
42:08 and um you have a course about machine
42:12 learning like and i think
42:13 this course specifically focus uh is
42:17 it focuses on people who are software
42:19 engineers and who want to transition
42:21 to machine learning exactly the topic
42:22 today maybe you can talk
42:24 a bit about this course so what what
42:27 people
42:27 will find in this course so this is a
42:30 this is a course for people that want to
42:33 start but they
42:34 really don't know how to do it so i talk
42:36 a little bit about the
42:37 the right approach that you should take
42:39 for machine learning
42:41 i talk about specific problems depending
42:43 on where you are
42:44 specific problems that you can go and
42:46 solve so i give like i think it's like
42:48 10 different problems that you can go
42:50 and solve i talk about books
42:52 i talk about you know job opportunities
42:54 stuff like that that you want to know so
42:56 imagine that you're
42:58 thinking about getting into machine
42:59 learning but you need to talk to
43:01 somebody
43:01 so this is me talking for 100 minutes
43:05 about the career and what you should
43:07 expect and how you should approach it
43:09 and what books and what courses you
43:10 should take to to
43:12 to you know to make it into the industry
43:14 i'm actually working right now in
43:16 version two of the course which
43:17 you know i'm just gonna replace the
43:19 first one because since i built that
43:21 course i've learned so much
43:22 so i'm working on the second version to
43:24 replace the first one
43:26 uh just to make that advice a little bit
43:29 let's call it better
43:30 right yeah that's what it's about but
43:32 yeah i remember watching this course
43:34 and to me like what i felt after
43:37 watching it
43:38 is that you somehow got into my head
43:41 took all the thoughts i have about like
43:43 how engineers should
43:45 approach uh getting into machine
43:48 learning
43:48 and you put it out in such a concise
43:51 and motivating manner so this is
43:54 excellent i recommend everyone who is
43:56 who is interested in this to check this
43:58 course out
43:59 yeah i appreciate it we have quite a lot
44:02 of questions and
44:04 one thing we promised to get back to
44:07 is for those who are not necessarily
44:09 great at coding
44:10 how can we how can they improve this
44:13 because one of the things we mentioned
44:14 is that coding is very important and
44:16 many people who failed
44:18 machine learning course it was not
44:20 because of the lack of math skills they
44:22 had
44:22 but because of their coding skills so
44:25 how can people
44:26 uh improve their coding skills yeah so
44:28 that is great question so
44:30 there is definitely a path for you if
44:32 you don't know coding to get good at
44:33 machine learning itself and then pick up
44:35 coding as you go there is definitely a
44:37 path there
44:38 i do have less experience with that path
44:41 because i'm usually focused on people
44:43 that already know how to code
44:45 so it's obviously natural for me to
44:47 recommend people if you don't know how
44:48 to code
44:49 first get excited about building
44:51 solutions first get there so don't worry
44:53 about machine learning that will come at
44:55 the right time and right place
44:57 focused on building things with your
45:00 computer
45:00 right focused on building programs learn
45:03 python
45:04 learn how to solve different problems
45:06 and machine learning will be a nice
45:08 addition to that by the way this is just
45:10 what i recommend
45:10 it's not necessary to i know people that
45:14 started with machine learning and added
45:16 coding
45:17 later on there is definitely a way to
45:19 make it but i usually recommend people
45:20 to start with python focus
45:22 there and then come back into machine
45:24 learning yeah
45:27 yeah i my wife is doing a course now i
45:30 don't remember the name it's about
45:31 python
45:32 and what she's doing there is um
45:35 she uses selenium to automate um
45:39 job application process on linkedin so
45:41 in linkedin there is this quick apply
45:43 button
45:44 right so you can apply from linkedin
45:46 without filling in
45:47 uh like a big application form so she
45:49 wrote a boat
45:50 uh a bot that you know goes through
45:53 linkedin every day
45:54 finds all this easy apply buttons and
45:56 clicks on them
45:58 this is a cool project it has no machine
46:00 learning in it at all
46:01 but this is a fun thing to build yeah
46:04 definitely
46:04 you can do so many things with this uh
46:07 with tools like selenium you can
46:09 automate so much so many
46:11 different routine things so like if
46:14 you're looking to
46:16 improve your coding skills maybe this
46:18 could be a fun thing to do like
46:20 like brighter job applications so many
46:23 projects that you can build that don't
46:25 require machine learning actually
46:27 the first rule of machine learning is
46:29 you may not need machine learning at all
46:31 to solve your problem right that's the
46:33 first rule
46:34 uh so yeah there is so much to do
46:36 without it yeah for sure
46:38 and what about uh like we need some
46:42 not just coding we also need to follow
46:45 some good practices
46:46 like good software engineering skills um
46:50 like how can we improve this kind of
46:53 skills
46:53 yeah or model deployment for production
46:56 um
46:56 oh yeah yeah i know what you're focusing
46:58 on right now so i was going to say
47:00 before you mentioned model deployment i
47:01 was going to say that
47:02 an area that's uh so valued
47:06 uh of of of being an engineer is
47:09 is getting getting experience on
47:12 algorithms and data
47:14 i'm sorry on data structures in general
47:16 so that the computing fundamentals part
47:19 it's very underappreciated i'm going to
47:22 say but it's extremely helpful
47:24 in your career remember you're not just
47:26 limited to do one thing here i'm the
47:28 only thing that i'm going to do is
47:29 building models
47:30 there's way more to building models or
47:32 to providing solutions than building a
47:34 model
47:35 and that comes with the second part
47:36 which is what you meant
47:38 you just mentioned machine learning
47:40 system uh
47:41 the life cycle goes from project scoping
47:45 where you have to take a project and
47:47 understand it and decide what is the
47:49 best solution decide
47:50 whether there is even machine learning
47:52 here to be applied
47:54 uh so it goes from there communication
47:57 is is key there
47:59 goes to the data uh part of the life
48:02 cycle
48:02 where you grab the data collect the data
48:05 you know store the data
48:06 transform the data do all of that goes
48:08 to modeling
48:10 which is usually where we focus when we
48:12 talked about machine learning is the
48:14 sexy part right
48:16 building this model that predicts things
48:19 and then goes to deployment
48:21 maintenance and monitoring requires a
48:25 lot of
48:25 uh what we call machine learning
48:27 operations or you know
48:29 how do we deploy this theme and then
48:31 containerization comes into place
48:34 monitoring those apis and the cloud
48:36 so if you look at the whole life cycle
48:38 you're going to realize that
48:40 an engineer has to do a bunch of
48:42 different stuff
48:43 now i know people that specialize in one
48:45 of those buckets
48:46 they specialize in the data they're you
48:49 know data analysis
48:50 for example people that specialize in
48:52 deployment
48:53 maintenance etc which is the more like
48:55 an mlaps
48:56 and people that specialize in modeling
48:58 power right
48:59 but some people have to go through the
49:02 whole spectrum some people have to work
49:04 on every single step of that life cycle
49:06 so definitely a lot of opportunities
49:09 definitely
49:10 a lot of skills to acquire so yeah
49:13 anything that you can do to become a
49:15 better engineer
49:16 anything that you it's it's just going
49:17 to help you providing value at the end
49:20 of the day which is what matters
49:21 yeah do you have any specific
49:24 recommendations
49:25 how to approach that so like i see two
49:29 things so in the process you mentioned
49:31 so first you said we formulate the
49:34 business problem then there is uh the
49:36 part when we do
49:37 data pre-processing then there is the
49:39 sexy part of modeling
49:40 then there is deployment part so two out
49:43 of these
49:44 five steps so the the data prep and
49:46 model deployment
49:47 they are very heavy on engineering right
49:49 they are do you
49:50 have any specific recommendations how to
49:53 become
49:54 better in this particular phases uh
49:58 like when it comes to absolutely so in
50:00 the model in the deployment part
50:02 uh it's gonna any skills that you can
50:05 grab from devops
50:06 uh they're gonna pay a lot of dividends
50:10 for you right like
50:11 learning how to build apis just using
50:13 flask or fast api in python
50:16 so all of that knowledge they're going
50:17 to be acquiring before even getting into
50:19 machine learning they're definitely
50:20 going to pay off
50:21 learning how to use docker something
50:23 like docker how to put
50:24 your application your api inside a
50:26 container is definitely going to pay off
50:28 right uh learning a cloud provider
50:31 or how to use amazon how to use google
50:34 cloud
50:35 or in the case of amazon aws or azure
50:38 those cloud providers learning how to
50:40 create lambda functions all of that
50:42 stuff
50:43 is definitely going to pay pay up here
50:45 because
50:46 it's about building systems that clients
50:49 have access to
50:51 so all of those little things that
50:52 you're putting together
50:54 today in preparation to learn machine
50:56 learning or to become a better engineer
50:58 are definitely going to pay out
51:00 uh when you get to the end of the the
51:02 road or not the end of the road but
51:04 whenever you get to the market and you
51:05 start
51:06 trying to deliver this value so yeah
51:08 don't
51:10 don't waste any opportunities or don't
51:12 say no to any opportunities to become a
51:14 better engineer because all of that
51:17 factors and
51:18 and all of that is going to help yeah
51:20 yeah i think so maybe i just want to add
51:22 a bit that
51:23 the things we discussed when how to
51:26 approach learning machine learning
51:28 also apply here so you don't just go and
51:32 uh
51:32 you know read a book about the cloud you
51:35 think
51:36 first about the problem and then you try
51:38 to solve this problem with the cloud
51:40 right so you focus on your problem first
51:42 because
51:43 otherwise the cloud is such a big topic
51:46 it's just yeah it's not possible to
51:50 to and then okay how do you yeah it's
51:52 not such
51:53 thing as go and learn the cloud yeah
51:55 exactly yeah here are five steps to
51:57 learn the cloud there's
51:58 no such thing it's just it's huge right
52:01 so you just have to just pick and choose
52:03 and what do i need right now in order to
52:05 get this
52:06 project here in the next state right so
52:09 what do i need to learn
52:10 it's a lambda function oh i need to put
52:12 the lambda function behind these things
52:13 so that's the way you start building
52:16 all of the possible pieces that are
52:17 going to get you to a final solution
52:19 yeah
52:20 yeah we have a question and i'm
52:22 interested about
52:23 uh your take if
52:26 um what is in your in your opinion the
52:29 difference between
52:32 machine learning and data science well
52:34 that's uh
52:36 that is a hard question to to answer
52:39 because i don't think there is consensus
52:41 on the on the industry i do see
52:44 personally and this is just my personal
52:46 opinion
52:47 i do see machine learning as a more
52:51 hands-on practical side of the equation
52:54 and i see data science
52:57 as a more theoretical field
53:00 that is just me a lot of people will
53:02 definitely disagree
53:04 a lot of companies use these titles
53:06 interchangeably so like you're a data
53:08 scientist and what you're doing is
53:10 very hands-on and you're a machine
53:12 learning person or what you do is very
53:14 theoretical but i do i do sort of like
53:16 separate those two in my head like that
53:18 way that machine learning is more
53:20 hands-on
53:21 more let's build something let's put it
53:23 out there uh
53:24 data science is more science right it's
53:27 more
53:28 theories more let's create things that
53:31 don't exist
53:32 right now so that's the way i look at it
53:34 interesting so the way i look at this
53:36 is a bit different so it's from a
53:38 different angle
53:39 so the way i think about this so you
53:42 have data science and machine learning
53:44 is one of the tools
53:45 there but there are other tools so
53:48 like for example if you are solving a
53:51 problem with data science you don't
53:53 always need to go
53:54 and take machine learning and use it as
53:56 a tool maybe there is a simpler
53:58 approach that you can use maybe you can
54:00 just use i like that one yeah
54:02 i definitely like that way so you look
54:04 at machine learning as a subset of
54:07 data not a subset it's like uh
54:12 you know you are a carpenter and you
54:15 have different tools
54:16 right so one thing you have i don't know
54:19 what kind of tools carpenters have
54:21 um hammers
54:25 and then maybe a tool set with hum like
54:27 different hammers
54:28 this would be machine learning right and
54:30 then there is a different
54:31 set of uh tools that would be maybe
54:34 something else
54:35 i like it i like it yeah but so data
54:37 scientists a data scientist to you will
54:40 be somebody that's capable of using
54:42 machine learning but it's also capable
54:44 of doing
54:44 other stuff yeah or using other
54:47 different tool sets
54:48 than not only machine learning yeah i
54:50 like that i haven't seen other people
54:53 um actively saying this so i'm not sure
54:56 like
54:56 if there is consensus
54:59 i like to be honest i've seen yeah i've
55:01 seen these concepts
55:03 used all over the place for two
55:04 different things yeah
55:06 so i'm not sure there is consensus
55:09 okay so we have a question from
55:12 ali i am an application developer
55:15 uh manager uh so
55:19 there is a lot of obligations so i'm
55:20 trying to read it so i'm trying to learn
55:22 machine learning
55:23 should i start with machine learning
55:25 projects or attend course
55:28 or learn math and how to decide which
55:31 area in machine learning i can excel
55:33 i think we covered that uh but maybe we
55:36 can
55:37 reiterate a bit so what do you think uh
55:39 yeah so what i would say is if you
55:41 if you already got uh coding skills if
55:43 you already know how to develop software
55:45 there are two ways for you to start one
55:46 way is try to find a problem really
55:48 quick and try to solve it and the kaggle
55:50 tutorial is the perfect place to start
55:52 and you're not gonna miss it go to cargo
55:54 and
55:54 there's gonna be a list of tutorials you
55:56 know you will know what which one to
55:58 pick
55:58 if you want a little bit more theory
56:00 before starting with a problem
56:02 i would recommend you go on to the
56:05 machine learning course in coursera
56:07 from andrew inc is an amazing
56:09 introduction to machine learning i think
56:10 like four million people have taken that
56:12 course so far it's probably
56:14 one of the most popular one if not the
56:16 most popular course out there
56:18 start there that's gonna give you a ton
56:19 of theory and from there you can start
56:22 jumping back
56:22 back and forth from problem so those
56:25 paths any of those will definitely work
56:27 for you
56:28 uh yeah that's that's what i would do
56:30 that's a
56:31 good course and i i am one of these four
56:34 millions
56:35 oh yeah yes this is how i started
56:38 my career in machine learning by
56:40 watching that course
56:42 um now we have a lot of comments i
56:46 uh so i wasn't there able to pick you to
56:49 to keep up with them one of the comments
56:51 i noticed about this lizard book
56:53 is that a few people commented that math
56:56 gets quite difficult in chapter four
57:01 um so how do you how do you
57:04 uh how did you deal with this uh so let
57:07 me let me check chapter four here really
57:09 quick
57:09 let me see what we're talking about the
57:12 lizard book
57:13 part two chapter four training models is
57:15 that the one
57:16 or part four
57:20 well there is or in the book so in
57:22 training models so i'm not sure so let
57:24 me tell you this i'm not a math guy i
57:26 promise you
57:27 that right i i'm as good as math as
57:30 anyone else that is not good at math and
57:33 i've been able
57:34 to survive and i've been able to provide
57:36 value so i
57:37 i want you to put aside that
57:41 math is gonna kill me and i want you to
57:44 focus
57:45 on what can i do today to provide value
57:47 and i promise
57:48 math is gonna come with it without you
57:50 thinking that you have to go through the
57:52 math
57:52 so i cannot comment on chapter four
57:55 because
57:56 honestly i have maybe not it's a
57:58 different uh there are a couple of
58:00 little books out there maybe there is a
58:02 different user book so this is the one
58:04 that i have here
58:05 maybe there is a different one chapter
58:07 four here is about training models
58:10 uh maybe maybe in that chapter is when
58:12 he talks about gradient descent
58:14 uh get the idea get the overall idea you
58:17 do not have to understand how to do
58:19 grading descent by hand
58:21 that's why we have libraries that do
58:23 that for us and we don't have to
58:24 implement training loops
58:26 anymore by hand that's not necessary you
58:30 don't have to
58:30 sort of like uh tattoo that into your
58:32 brain in order to do machine learning so
58:35 yeah yeah i think that's the best
58:38 recommendation i can give
58:39 regarding math yeah so what worked for
58:41 me
58:42 i remember that when i saw this big
58:44 formulas
58:45 usually some linear algebra some
58:47 multiplications and
58:49 for me what helped is trying to
58:52 translate these formulas into code and
58:55 when i
58:55 see them in the code i understand okay
58:58 this k
58:58 thing is just a bunch of for loops and i
59:01 know how to deal with for loops because
59:03 i am a developer right so i know how to
59:05 write this
59:06 even though it's like a nested like a
59:08 for matrix multiplication i think you
59:10 need
59:10 three loops but at the end it's still a
59:13 bunch of for loops
59:14 and we as developers we know how to deal
59:16 with forwards so then
59:18 like decomposing and uh expressing
59:21 things in code
59:22 really helps yeah that's that's not it
59:24 anymore yeah no what i try to do is
59:27 i try to get past the formula by trying
59:30 to explain
59:31 so what is an into intuitive way to
59:33 think about what's happening here right
59:35 instead of
59:36 like worrying about the formula and how
59:38 it's done
59:39 how can i explain what's happening and
59:41 that helps me a lot to get past that
59:44 formula
59:45 right not necessarily to understand how
59:46 to do it by hand but definitely to
59:48 understand
59:49 what's happening and why it works so
59:51 yeah that's that's what i try to do
59:54 yeah thanks so there is a question about
59:56 your course
59:57 and the link to this course i will post
59:59 this link a bit later
1:00:01 when we finish i will post this in the
1:00:02 description i will also post
1:00:05 your twitter santiago um anything else i
1:00:08 should add
1:00:08 in the description hi yeah no i think uh
1:00:12 yeah join me on twitter for sure so you
1:00:14 know stay tuned
1:00:15 that's that's what i i really feel happy
1:00:18 i feel validated that a lot of people
1:00:20 find the content helpful
1:00:22 and by the way by following me you're
1:00:24 also helping me
1:00:25 because you know if you provide feedback
1:00:27 if you tell me what what makes sense
1:00:29 what doesn't make sense that's the way i
1:00:32 learn as well so
1:00:33 yeah that's the only thing that i'll say
1:00:35 yeah okay any last words you want to say
1:00:38 before we wrap up thank you for having
1:00:39 me here i'm really really excited about
1:00:41 the
1:00:42 talks for the next few days uh
1:00:44 especially the one from elena i'm
1:00:45 looking forward to that one
1:00:47 yeah so elena already like her video
1:00:51 here is the most watched video on our
1:00:53 channel about
1:00:54 why your machine logic machine learning
1:00:57 projects
1:00:57 uh fail so that one uh the your
1:01:01 your second talk i think will be uh
1:01:04 we'll overcome the first one
1:01:05 i'm sure okay yeah okay i'm really
1:01:08 looking forward to that one as well yeah
1:01:10 for sure yeah thanks a lot for uh
1:01:13 joining us today for sharing your
1:01:15 knowledge with us
1:01:17 for giving uh i think it was very
1:01:20 motivating
1:01:21 because i know how many developers feel
1:01:24 about math
1:01:25 and i hope if we changed
1:01:28 the mind some people who will now go
1:01:31 and uh start solving problems
1:01:35 that would be really cool yes and i
1:01:38 think you managed to do this so i'm
1:01:40 pretty sure that
1:01:40 uh a few people today after finishing
1:01:43 this talk
1:01:44 will go and instead of focusing on math
1:01:47 we'll go on kaggle we'll find this
1:01:50 tutorial
1:01:51 and they will fit a decision tree
1:01:54 and they will stop being afraid yeah
1:01:57 yeah thank you santiago and thanks
1:02:01 everyone for watching
1:02:03 us and please check
1:02:06 if you don't know about the conference
