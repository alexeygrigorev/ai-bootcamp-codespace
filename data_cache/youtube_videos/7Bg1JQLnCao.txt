1:12 yeah great let's start
1:15 this week we'll talk about investing and
1:19 investing specifically in open source
1:21 too and in data and ml tools and we have
1:24 a special guest today Bella Bella is
1:27 working for a German family office that
1:30 invests in DC funds and early age
1:33 startups
1:34 with focus on open source data Ai and
1:38 developer Tooling in his work he is
1:40 sourcing evaluating and working with
1:42 many different open source companies
1:44 in the early stage or finding their
1:47 product Community Feed and actually
1:48 there is a funny story how we met
1:51 because we have this thing called open
1:53 source Spotlight and I it was a big
1:56 pleasure for me to discover that
1:59 people not only use this for looking at
2:03 tools like developers but also sometimes
2:05 investors also look at this so this is
2:08 helmet and it's my pleasure to welcome
2:10 you finally it's been a while since I
2:12 was trying to invite you to this podcast
2:14 so
2:15 Welcome to our podcast yeah happy to be
2:18 here it's a pleasure great
2:20 and the questions for today uh interview
2:22 were prepared by Elena Samuel Thanks
2:26 Elena for your help and Elena was
2:29 already a guest of us multiple times
2:32 and she works at an open source startup
2:36 and
2:37 thanks to here we have amazing questions
2:39 for today's interview before we go into
2:42 our main topic of Open Source and
2:44 investing in open source let's start
2:46 with your background can you tell us
2:48 about your career Journey so far yeah
2:51 for sure so I I think it's maybe a
2:53 little untypical for for your show but I
2:56 have a classical business background
2:58 um but right after my studies start
3:00 working in in the startup and Tech
3:02 ecosystem so right after after my
3:05 business studies I worked at the company
3:07 Builder
3:08 um who was about commercializing under
3:11 commercialized open source communities
3:15 um and right after that I joined tkm
3:18 family office where I am today now since
3:20 pretty much two years I'm helping to
3:23 build up the the investment activity so
3:25 I started there right when the family
3:27 office also started and as you said
3:30 correctly looking for startups
3:33 um talking to Founders a lot researching
3:35 those topics
3:37 um especially on the on the open source
3:40 and developer tooling data site and
3:42 that's also why I'm happy to be here
3:44 today
3:46 yeah and it's indeed not a very typical
3:49 background uh it's uh which makes it
3:52 even more interesting to have you on on
3:54 this row but I'm wondering what does it
3:57 mean to have business background or what
3:59 do you actually study there like how to
4:01 run a business or what yeah like
4:05 it for sure differs from from University
4:07 to the university but in general it is
4:09 about okay that you know like like the
4:12 the most important stuff also for for uh
4:15 yeah doing what I do today is to
4:17 understand how a company is structured
4:19 to understand how to I don't know read a
4:22 balance sheet to think about business
4:25 models to think about
4:26 margins marketing and all this kind of
4:29 stuff so it's a very general
4:32 um type of type of study but yeah that's
4:34 that's in general it so
4:36 um if you don't really know uh in which
4:40 way you want to go
4:42 um that's definitely good to have some
4:44 kind of orientation but you can for sure
4:46 more specialize later on to the studies
4:50 but I only did my bachelor's so I'm
4:52 quite a quite a very generalist type of
4:55 guy
4:56 um till I
4:57 um got into get into Tech and startups
5:00 and and venture
5:03 so MBA is also a business related thing
5:05 but it's more like Master Level
5:06 education yes it's Master Level and MBA
5:09 is also for non-uh business
5:13 um non-business Bachelor so if you did
5:15 for example an engineering major in your
5:17 in your
5:19 um I think this is for also for business
5:21 bachelors and undergrads but mainly I
5:25 think also for
5:26 um non-business undergrads to to make an
5:29 MBA to kind of go the
5:32 um executive kind of way in your in your
5:34 organization
5:37 okay so in your studies you learn how to
5:41 run a business how company structure and
5:44 yeah all that and then with this
5:46 background you
5:49 learned you joined the company that was
5:52 interested in commercializing open
5:54 source communities
5:55 what does it actually mean
5:57 commercialized in open source
5:58 communities so it was a very small
6:00 company Builder
6:01 um run run by Philip who is also our
6:04 chief investment officer today
6:07 um and yeah the thesis of a company
6:10 builder in in general is like okay
6:13 um we can we have kind of a thesis and
6:17 the Machinery to build up more and more
6:20 um early stage startups
6:21 um and and spin them out get Founders
6:24 there and so on and so forth and the
6:26 specific
6:28 um thesis there was that
6:31 there is a lot of value in these
6:33 communities and back then we have seen
6:37 or we thought that there might be a lot
6:40 of communities that don't have any
6:43 access to any kind of commercial version
6:45 of a product so there are a lot of Open
6:47 Source Products with a lot of traction
6:50 um in the open source world but there's
6:52 no one to kind of build some additional
6:56 features around it host it package it
6:58 make it a great experience and sell it
7:01 um but with the first
7:03 kind of
7:04 um yeah it it turns out that it's really
7:07 cost intensive to build
7:09 a lot of startups so we found it out
7:12 um in this company Builder founded at
7:14 one one startup which is called crowd
7:16 death
7:18 um I think
7:19 um some of you might uh heard a lot
7:21 about it in the open source word so it's
7:22 about Community Management and this kind
7:25 of this kind of stuff
7:27 um Jonathan who who runs it today as CEO
7:29 and founder he was also the second
7:31 founder of the company Builder
7:34 um so um yeah and that was actually also
7:36 the whole team of the company Builders
7:38 so then Jonathan went out in the crowd
7:40 full-time uh Philip got the offer to to
7:43 start the the family office and um he
7:46 asked me asked me to join and I took the
7:49 opportunity and and that's how we went
7:51 there so
7:52 um yeah it was a also quite
7:54 um short Journey with the company
7:56 Builder but really was my first touch
7:57 point with open source so I actually
8:00 didn't really heard about it even before
8:01 like I I just had a business background
8:04 and and not been in Tech uh really so
8:07 um yeah
8:09 interesting did you understand correctly
8:11 that the model for this company Builder
8:13 was to I don't know look at GitHub and
8:16 find promising open source projects and
8:19 then reach out to people who
8:22 create them asking hey do you want to
8:25 start a company for this project yeah I
8:27 have to say that there is no blueprint
8:28 on that because we there was never a
8:31 project that got so far so crowd death
8:34 was completely internally uh developed
8:37 and and is today open source but this
8:40 was kind of a a thought and a strategy
8:42 but then
8:44 um the the ways parted and then now
8:46 we're doing what we're doing so um but
8:48 yeah it kind of that's that's an idea
8:51 that that we had
8:52 okay
8:54 but right now you thought okay like it's
8:57 maybe better instead of finding
9:00 Founders and all these people who can
9:02 start the company let's focus on
9:05 companies that already exist and give
9:07 the money right it wasn't
9:10 um really my decision as you said so so
9:13 Philip got the offer uh he asked me to
9:15 join and it's a great opportunity and um
9:18 yeah it is definitely
9:20 um easier with a smaller team to invest
9:22 than to build
9:24 um own like like your own companies
9:26 definitely so we are
9:29 um yeah Philip and me the only really uh
9:31 full-time persons in the investment team
9:33 so
9:35 um it wouldn't wouldn't be so easy to to
9:37 build up I don't know one one company
9:39 per month with this team so um but
9:42 that's that's the story thank you
9:44 why are investors needed at all Kent
9:47 Founders just you know
9:51 just that companies without you yeah so
9:54 why are you need it yeah yeah so so
9:57 um venture capital in specific I think
10:00 investors are not needed for any type of
10:02 business I think
10:04 um you do not need to think that so
10:07 um but venture capital and Tech in
10:09 specific I would say so they they
10:12 provide the money for you to build up
10:15 the tech startups from the ground up so
10:18 when you start also as a first-time
10:21 founder you're not having that much
10:22 money you need to have some money to to
10:24 hire your first employees to get your
10:27 first setups to whatever you want to do
10:30 and
10:31 um
10:32 and to be able to do that and
10:35 um and not need to focus on
10:37 profitability right away you need some
10:40 kind of
10:41 um yeah investor investor to help you
10:44 um because they enable you to to focus
10:47 on growth and building instead of uh
10:49 only selling and making margin from the
10:52 other days and they are also
10:54 um they also make it possible for
10:56 Founders to pay themselves a salary uh
10:58 from the beginning right if you're
11:00 thinking about bootstrapping something
11:03 um which can be definitely a great way
11:05 because also
11:06 um I I have to say not every startup not
11:09 every Tech business even is a venture
11:12 case
11:13 um but
11:15 um it definitely is something that you
11:17 that you can have a salary that you can
11:19 make a living from your startup from day
11:22 one
11:23 um yeah at least from day one when you
11:25 raised
11:27 um so yeah that's that's why I would say
11:29 they're needed so investors give
11:32 Founders money to run a company to build
11:35 the startup and the alternative you
11:37 mentioned is bootstrapping when the
11:40 founders do not
11:42 look for external investment in external
11:45 money they try to earn money themselves
11:47 and then from this money so they focus
11:49 on profitability and then from this
11:51 money the way
11:53 themselves the salary and then hire the
11:55 first employees but it's not always easy
11:57 and I guess especially in open source
11:59 right so open source is usually
12:01 if you do not directly from day one make
12:04 money out of Open Source yeah it's and
12:07 it's slower and it it's also defocuses
12:10 you from from growing and building
12:13 um because you always have to think
12:14 about oh how can I um I don't know
12:17 Finance the next month
12:19 um and so on but
12:21 um yeah that that are the two main main
12:23 ways I I mean there are some people who
12:25 already made some money who can who can
12:27 Finance their own Venture but then
12:29 they're their own investors I would say
12:31 so this also goes in the category of of
12:34 having an investor
12:36 which means let's say I work at the
12:39 usual full-time job I set aside some
12:41 money
12:42 and then with this money I can just run
12:44 a company then I don't need an investor
12:47 yeah you have a you have something for
12:49 the start but it really depends on what
12:52 kind of business you want to build it
12:53 really differs um if you have a
12:55 bootstrap business building uh like in
12:57 profitability from day one maybe a
13:00 little bit slower but
13:02 um you definitely know what to do their
13:06 Adventure is is also you really have to
13:09 know that it it is a little bit
13:10 different if you take money the first
13:12 time from an investor you definitely
13:14 need to have it a second and a third
13:16 time so it's
13:19 um you have to decide for which way you
13:20 want to go but especially in in the
13:23 um yeah in the ecosystem right now and
13:25 in data and open source I would say
13:27 there are so many
13:29 um yeah you really have to see
13:31 um where you find your spot in terms of
13:33 competition and positioning and it's
13:35 hard to compete
13:37 um without having having any money in
13:39 your pockets
13:41 just uh it's not one of the questions we
13:44 plan to ask you but maybe you have some
13:46 ideas why do companies actually
13:49 do business in open source because it's
13:52 a very difficult business model right
13:54 you open all the code from the very
13:56 beginning and then like everyone can
13:58 just go there take the code and do not
14:00 pay you anything
14:01 yet there are startups who do that and
14:03 there are companies investors there are
14:06 investors who invest in them say Okay
14:08 work in the open keep all the code open
14:11 and here's money to do that so why does
14:15 such a thing even exist
14:17 yeah I mean I mean there are different
14:20 ways those companies get started right
14:22 there are some who are just a hobby
14:23 project from from some Engineers so this
14:26 is the way why they open source it
14:28 because it was a hobby project and
14:30 that's the way you build uh normally in
14:33 public and so on so
14:36 um that's that's one part and if you're
14:38 once open source it's it's also if you
14:40 have a certain size of community it's
14:42 hard to take it back so so then you're
14:45 in it but there are also a lot of
14:47 especially startups who who planned to
14:49 go the open source way because it's a
14:52 way of
14:53 um a distribution and building up a
14:54 motor against competition in the in the
14:56 long run and it is not always even if if
15:00 the a lot of people wouldn't consider
15:01 that like real open source but a lot of
15:04 them don't have their whole code uh open
15:07 source they have proprietary features
15:09 around it they have proprietary versions
15:11 um a lot of the the customers they
15:13 address wouldn't make the hustle to to
15:16 um self-host it
15:18 um so
15:19 um yeah that's the way so a lot of them
15:22 see it as distribution channels building
15:24 building a competitive mode through the
15:26 community uh selling through their
15:27 Community
15:29 um having this kind of uh yeah potential
15:31 for early traction without Revenue so um
15:34 yeah
15:35 as a developer myself I I would add that
15:38 I kind of have more trust in companies
15:42 in code yeah awesome good point yeah I
15:47 know I just take a package from GitHub I
15:50 don't know do something like pip install
15:52 package name and then have it experiment
15:55 with this and if something is not clear
15:57 I could just go to GitHub and I look at
15:59 the code and I see that okay makes sense
16:01 right so I have it's zero like the entry
16:05 level
16:06 it's nothing I can just install it and
16:09 then play with this and then I have
16:10 trust in this thing yeah yeah this
16:13 essentially is part of this this kind of
16:15 distribution way because if you want to
16:16 go this Community Driven uh go to market
16:19 right especially with a focus on
16:22 developers it is exactly how you set
16:25 they have more trust and open source you
16:27 can build a bottom-up community
16:30 very much easier when you when you build
16:33 it open then then with the closed I
16:36 don't know free version
16:38 um yeah
16:40 and bottom-up community means what does
16:43 it actually mean I
16:45 it's it's from the distribution side so
16:47 you could you could do your go to market
16:50 bottom up so you start with with the
16:52 smaller people using your product like
16:55 the developers and on the other side it
16:58 would be potential to to make like
17:00 typical top-down Enterprise sales how
17:03 you would call it so starting at the
17:04 decision makers and making very very big
17:07 deals there and and the the community
17:10 building and the bottom-up way
17:12 um that that we see also not in open
17:14 source a lot of them also do top-down
17:17 sales later on but um especially in the
17:20 beginning we see a lot of a lot of this
17:22 okay how you can find the individual
17:25 people using your product and you can
17:27 find developers
17:29 um in the open source spaces
17:31 as a developer I do not necessarily have
17:34 money to buy a tool yeah but because it
17:38 doesn't cost anything I just download it
17:40 and run it and then I can come to my
17:42 manager and say look there's this
17:44 awesome tool what about self-cost unit
17:47 and then my manager would say yeah I
17:49 will talk to my manager about that
17:51 definitely it's the manager of my
17:53 manager actually has the money and has
17:56 the budget and then they say okay like
17:58 it looks like a useful tool here's the
18:00 money yeah yeah it's a little bit of
18:02 like the evolution of the the product
18:04 let's sales that that
18:06 um also slack and so on in notion
18:08 whatever did with like some people used
18:10 it some people used it together and then
18:13 you're coming uh oh now I have to pay
18:15 but now already 50 people are using it
18:19 um as their main I don't know
18:20 note-taking tool and now we really have
18:23 to pay for it and it's it's it's the
18:26 evolution in the developer space for the
18:28 same kind of uh yeah Playbook
18:31 interesting so when preparing for this
18:34 podcast episode I learned a new word
18:37 thesis uh well I did know this word but
18:40 in a different context so for me it was
18:42 like Master thesis right I think I wrote
18:45 at University but here you already
18:47 mentioned this word thesis like what
18:50 your company Builder the thesis was that
18:53 you
18:54 find you find Founders and then let them
18:57 run a company and then there is a thing
18:59 called investment thesis and I guess
19:01 this is for investors what they invest
19:05 in and in which company Center so what I
19:08 wanted to ask what is your investment
19:09 thesis where do you invest in which
19:12 companies at which stage yeah
19:15 so um we definitely uh as I think I've
19:20 already mentioned to to early stage so
19:22 we consider this as like as early as
19:24 possible but not not really later than
19:27 seat round so in normal
19:30 um yeah in in Venture
19:32 um language you have the first round is
19:35 sometimes an angel round sometimes a
19:37 pre-seed round it depends you can always
19:39 frame it however you want sometimes you
19:42 also reframe it
19:44 um yeah in the future go uh to other
19:47 rounds what does it actually mean to
19:49 have an age around or pre-seat round why
19:52 why angel
19:53 yeah so it's it's very blurry you can
19:57 actually call everything anything I
20:00 think but
20:02 um and I have seen a lot a lot of
20:03 different words for a lot of same stuff
20:06 but
20:07 um
20:08 I think essentially angels are
20:11 non-institutional investors so like
20:13 Angel rounds you have institutional
20:15 investors are we will I think come to
20:17 that later like Venture Capital funds
20:19 and also corporate Venture Capital uh
20:22 investors
20:24 um and and basically with money yeah
20:27 yeah and Angel
20:29 um rounds are pretty much only for
20:31 individual investors which include
20:33 business angels and family offices also
20:36 um and pre-seed rounds could be in the
20:39 same size but preced their dedicated
20:41 precede Venture Capital funds also but
20:43 they are also sometimes investing in age
20:45 around so the wording is not quite quite
20:48 um clear I think
20:51 when you already have an idea as a
20:53 founder or potential founder and then
20:55 maybe you have some code maybe you
20:57 already have some GitHub repo and then
20:59 you see okay like this is promising
21:02 here's a bunch of money
21:04 and Angel round or preced money or
21:07 proceed around actually you can do it
21:09 however you want and it also sometimes
21:11 depends on the size right we have seen
21:13 um the the French guys from Mistral
21:15 raising over 100 million in a seat round
21:18 as their first round which some people
21:20 would call the precede round even but
21:22 and 100 million sometimes it's a serious
21:25 C so it really is uh there are no no uh
21:29 rules for that but uh definitely I would
21:33 say that it's better to start with the
21:37 um smallest name possible so
21:40 always consider raising a precede
21:42 instead of a seat if you've not raised
21:43 before because it gives you an
21:45 opportunity
21:47 um for the seat round to raise also
21:50 without revenue and so on because you
21:52 will not really be able to to raise the
21:55 series a without a certain metrics but
21:57 see sometimes so
22:00 um yeah but the names are really blurry
22:03 and you can call everything everything
22:06 and it's it's not a rules I would say
22:10 but you normally start with the precede
22:12 then goes the seed and then the serious
22:14 A B C D and so on comes so this is
22:18 um the normal the normal way however
22:20 typically a company or a Founder says
22:22 hey this is what I have give me some
22:24 money so they put a call or an open call
22:28 maybe they reach out to different
22:29 investors and then investors think okay
22:32 this is promising here's some money
22:33 right and they do it multiple times yes
22:37 yes so so in the best case you as a as a
22:41 Founder should think about what kind of
22:43 money you need for the next 12 to 18
22:45 months for example it depends so I want
22:48 to hire I don't know two three
22:50 developers I want to hire
22:52 whatever I need this amount amount of
22:54 money for that I want to make some
22:56 marketing is I don't know experiments I
22:58 need some money for that so at all I
22:59 need XYZ type of money
23:02 um and then I go out with this I need
23:05 this because all the investors is going
23:06 to ask you what do you need that money
23:08 for and if you don't have a good answer
23:09 to that that's not a good sign
23:12 um if you don't know what you what
23:13 you're raising for so and and then yeah
23:16 the the investors have their process and
23:18 the investors normally if you have a
23:20 venture fund and you invest typically in
23:23 one with the money from One Fund you
23:26 invest into 20 to 40
23:29 um startups depends always on this on
23:31 the around you're investing in but in
23:33 early stage I would say most of them
23:35 invest in like 20 to 30 to 40 uh
23:38 different uh companies
23:41 okay so yeah
23:44 you focus on
23:47 Angel rounds preced rounds and yes seat
23:50 rounds early stage when companies do not
23:53 have much in terms of money in terms of
23:56 investment yet and you focus on open
23:58 source right yes so um our main focus so
24:04 so our general focus is is everything
24:06 that is B2B software but our Niche is uh
24:10 developer stack developer tooling and a
24:12 lot of this is open source because open
24:14 source is a great go to market model for
24:17 those kind of companies but not
24:18 everything we do is open source but not
24:20 every everything we do is even developer
24:24 tooling but the most of it so
24:27 um yeah as you said we're doing pre-seed
24:29 seed seed runs mainly in Europe
24:32 so we would also do but mainly in Europe
24:35 um and so yeah we we really like as I
24:39 said in this Niche
24:41 um Founders and companies for the strong
24:43 focus on Community Driven go-to markets
24:46 as for example open source
24:49 um and this includes like we did stuff
24:53 in AI infrastructure in cyber security
24:55 and cloud in data streaming so
24:58 um but we also did uh to mention here
25:01 maybe not not interesting for everyone
25:02 watching this but we also did
25:04 investments in in other areas of B2B
25:07 software like inter Logistics data
25:09 privacy Robotics and and so on and so
25:12 forth so but the main focus I would say
25:14 80 of what we do nowadays is in this
25:17 niche
25:18 we already talked about angels so they
25:21 are individuals who have some money and
25:24 they invest maybe not so much money but
25:27 they have some money and they say okay
25:28 these startups promising here's
25:31 a small
25:32 investment
25:34 and there are also VC funds these are
25:37 larger organizations with more money so
25:39 they
25:40 I guess typically invest they give more
25:43 money to companies and there are also
25:45 family funds right there's family
25:47 offices this is where you work right and
25:51 what is the difference or what does it
25:52 actually mean to have a family office uh
25:55 what is it what is a family office and
25:57 what's the difference between angels and
25:59 PC funds yeah yeah so so I maybe start
26:02 with the with the funds because it's the
26:04 most prominent I would say type of type
26:06 of investor that you see also in the
26:08 news and so on so there in the end I
26:11 would say like money managers so they
26:13 are raising capitals from outside
26:15 investors like uh big Pension funds yeah
26:19 in the US also um from from the
26:22 University funds government programs in
26:25 in
26:26 um in Europe and Germany
26:28 um and also in different world and
26:30 corporate investors individual investors
26:32 could be Angels could be family offices
26:34 corporate investors could be classic
26:36 corporates big companies who have a
26:39 financial interest just in in working
26:42 with their money so they're raising a
26:44 fund
26:46 um from this kind of people and
26:48 organizations they have a certain amount
26:51 of time and they try to maximize what
26:53 they can give back to them
26:55 um so that's the the model of the VC
26:56 fund and then you have the ones who work
26:59 with
27:00 um their own money which are business
27:02 agents and family offices for example
27:06 I would say also there the line is a
27:08 little bit blurry I think historically
27:10 family offices are more connected to
27:14 um to yeah businesses
27:17 but nowadays a family office is also
27:20 just just meaning that you as an angel
27:23 invest a little bit more and a little
27:25 bit more professional so
27:28 um
27:29 Angel and and family office doesn't
27:31 really uh have to be a lot different
27:34 there are for sure also family of us who
27:36 are quite closely connected to an
27:38 operational business because they then
27:41 also invest
27:42 um with not only financial interests but
27:45 also they want to have some overlaps and
27:48 with their their operational business
27:49 but we for example we don't have any
27:51 operational business we are pretty much
27:54 a VC fund but only with our own money
27:57 that we have in the company
28:00 so um I don't know if this this answers
28:03 if this answers your question
28:05 more or less maybe let me try to
28:08 summarize yeah I understood so
28:12 business angels or Angel Investors are
28:15 people with their own money and they
28:17 themselves manage this money so for
28:19 example I have a bunch of money I see a
28:21 promising startup that is Raising around
28:24 they need some money and I say okay
28:26 here's uh ten thousand dollars or
28:29 whatever
28:30 right and then oh thank you with this
28:32 money we can pay our developer for one
28:34 month or whatever
28:37 so this is uh Angel investment and
28:39 investors
28:41 and from what I know like typically
28:44 they don't give like a ton of money to
28:47 startups then there are from what I
28:50 understood there are family offices
28:52 here the difference between a business
28:54 angel and a family office is the person
28:57 with the money hires somebody to run
29:00 to to do these Investments so they don't
29:04 do themselves these calculations this uh
29:06 thinking like should they invest there
29:08 or should I not they hire somebody like
29:10 you for example who
29:12 who is doing that right and that's the
29:15 main difference
29:16 yeah so as I said there are also some
29:18 angels who work with employees but they
29:21 um it also maybe differs in terms of how
29:24 you Market it because all the angels are
29:27 also working with and like like entities
29:29 for their Investments so they're not
29:31 most of times not investing as as a
29:33 private person but yeah that's pretty
29:35 much it it's a little bit blurry I would
29:37 say family offices is a little bit more
29:40 professional setup
29:42 um and um yeah but family offices also
29:45 in in the past did a lot of other things
29:47 than than Venture Capital right so we
29:50 are focusing on venture capital A lot of
29:52 family offices are also like more
29:55 General money managers doing a lot of
29:57 real estate doing public equities doing
29:59 private equity in the more senior in
30:01 more senior companies so
30:03 um but it is quite blurry I would say in
30:07 general family offices make a little bit
30:09 larger checks and you really have to
30:12 differentiate between family officers
30:13 who have an operational business behind
30:16 it and kind of industry specific
30:19 um
30:19 specifics that yeah and and the ones who
30:23 operate like a venture capital investor
30:25 uh like like we do
30:27 and I was going to ask you about this
30:29 checks you mentioned that the family
30:31 officers typically give larger checks
30:33 because I have a few I know a few people
30:36 who do angel investment and from what
30:39 they told me the investment Investments
30:42 they make are not large like it can be
30:44 10 000 can be twenty thousand but uh
30:48 yeah for a startup just this investment
30:50 alone does not make
30:52 much difference but when they have like
30:54 10 20 Angel investment investors who
30:57 each of them give I don't know 10 20K
30:59 then they have some money for some time
31:02 right uh while a family office can give
31:04 a larger check larger than that because
31:07 they have more money I guess than an
31:09 individual who can invest in a startup
31:13 right yeah and I would say that also
31:15 business angels are typically more
31:17 focused on mainly early stages and there
31:20 are also a lot of family authors who do
31:22 later rounds and so the the amount of
31:24 check sizes that families family
31:26 officers rights are I think and pretty
31:29 much unkept so their ones are doing
31:30 series a series B Investments there are
31:33 ones like us who are doing early stage
31:35 Investments so um yeah but but yeah
31:38 that's pretty much pretty much it so but
31:41 there are also Angels who write 100K
31:43 checks so
31:45 um it really differs it's not hard to
31:48 really
31:49 um yeah I'm sorry to say that at a lot
31:51 of questions today but there's another a
31:53 rule for that it's uh yeah
31:58 because like if the case is different
32:00 like some people do not have a lot of
32:02 money in the end invest but some people
32:04 do right yeah and in the end you can you
32:07 can call yourself whatever you want like
32:10 yeah as long as you have money
32:14 yeah as long as you you do good work and
32:16 and do your stuff and um the people
32:19 won't really care if you're calling
32:21 yourself an angel investor if you or if
32:23 you're calling it I don't know
32:25 um my family office whatever I think it
32:28 doesn't really make a big difference
32:31 when you invest in open source in open
32:34 source companies what do you actually
32:36 look at what are the some what are the
32:38 criteria you use to make a decision
32:41 whether you want to give them money or
32:43 not and how much you want to give them
32:45 so how much is is a question that is
32:49 that is more um with how much they're
32:52 raising and how much our typical ticket
32:54 size is right so if you have a fund
32:57 um if you want to invest in in I would
33:01 say 20 30 whatever companies then you
33:04 need a typical ticket ticket size that
33:07 you write or at least a typical amount
33:09 of share you want to own after you
33:12 invest right so this really
33:15 um does not really depend so it's not
33:17 like I'm a little bit more committed to
33:20 this company so I invest more in this
33:22 and I'm a little bit I'm I'm thinking
33:24 that they're cool but not so cool so I'm
33:25 investing a little less
33:28 I think it doesn't work this way so you
33:30 really have to commit it full on every
33:32 startup you invest and it in the end it
33:35 is some amount of Finance in there so
33:38 you really have to make the calculations
33:40 if this works so there's this kind of
33:43 amount that's where the amount of money
33:45 comes from but in terms of which you
33:47 invest in so I would say
33:48 it also differs a lot from case to case
33:51 so there's for sure in the open source
33:53 world for example there's no minimum
33:55 amount of stars that you need so we also
33:58 see a lot of Investments that are made
34:00 pre-launch so they're calling themselves
34:02 an open source because they want to be
34:04 open source they want to see it as they
34:06 go to market but they're not even
34:07 launched so there's no metrics on the
34:10 open source side so I would say that
34:13 um stars are a great discovery metric
34:15 for example for me to discover projects
34:18 because
34:19 it's it's hard to discover something if
34:22 it's just a private GitHub repo so
34:24 that's quite hard
34:25 but it's not really you cannot really
34:28 tell that a startup that has twice as
34:30 much uh GitHub stores can can raise
34:32 twice as much money it really has to say
34:35 with okay the team must have an
34:37 understanding of the the value of the
34:39 community they uh must know or at least
34:42 have a plan how to grow it how to
34:44 capture the created value in the future
34:47 I think this is a very important part
34:48 for investors to understand if they
34:51 think that this team knows how to close
34:53 this kind of Gap that you sometimes have
34:56 an open source between value creation
34:57 and value capturing
35:00 um so I would say that there's no magic
35:02 recipe but
35:04 as an investor you definitely have to go
35:06 deep in this kind of
35:08 how do they think about their
35:09 commercialization and
35:12 um this kind of stuff and do they have a
35:15 an idea about it or do you yourself have
35:17 an idea about it you don't really have
35:19 to need everything figured out
35:22 but
35:23 um you have to think about it is this
35:25 product really can you make money out of
35:28 it
35:28 and besides that I would say that the
35:31 most important criteria is are the same
35:34 as a non-oper source company it's like
35:36 you look at Team you look at at the need
35:38 in the market how big is the problem
35:41 um and so on and so forth so especially
35:44 in presidency drones team is a is a very
35:47 big factor because products can also
35:49 change a lot market conditions can
35:51 change a lot um but but and also for the
35:54 founders I really have to say that
35:56 picking the right investors also from a
35:58 kind of human kind of way is very
36:01 important because you're working
36:02 together I don't know
36:04 10 years minimum uh most of the times so
36:08 that is really important
36:10 and
36:11 um so I would say yeah those those
36:14 commercialization ideas and so on are a
36:17 little bit different for open source and
36:19 you have to think about them as investor
36:21 but the most criteria are the same as in
36:24 in non-open Source startups
36:27 so you look at the founders and the team
36:29 then you look at uh product Market fit
36:33 like is there a need in the market and
36:35 how large it is right yeah and so there
36:38 is no product Market fit most of times
36:40 if you had pre-seater seats so if you
36:42 have a product Market fit that is really
36:44 when you have a lot of a lot a lot of
36:46 traction and the people are just ripping
36:48 your product out of your hands but you
36:49 have to understand if there's a
36:51 potential
36:52 is there really a problem are you
36:54 solving a problem or are you just
36:56 building anything
36:58 um and to build a solution and you're
37:00 just looking for a problem somewhere
37:01 okay so it's not the product Market fit
37:05 yet it's more like okay the problem does
37:07 exist and this is a solution so
37:09 potentially in the future there will be
37:10 uh product Market fit yeah and that's a
37:14 team that I I trust in to solve that
37:16 problem I think this is one of the most
37:18 important parts do you have like an
37:20 interview with them where you ask these
37:22 questions and they reply or they do a
37:24 presentation or how does it usually
37:25 because so it really depends on how
37:27 professional you are but we talk with
37:29 the founders multiple times before we
37:31 invest
37:32 um I have several calls with them to
37:35 interviews with potential and uh and
37:38 also current users talk with other
37:41 investors about it
37:43 um yeah so
37:45 um
37:46 I mean there are for sure some angels
37:48 who just see a pitch deck and and put
37:49 money on it but
37:52 um we for sure talk to the founders
37:55 um two three four five depends times
38:00 um and and um yeah definitely a very
38:03 important factor uh also to get to know
38:06 them to get to know how they think
38:08 um yeah
38:09 it's okay this is the kind of the feed
38:12 between you and Founders then you also
38:14 look at the team you'll look at the
38:16 problem size and then when it comes to
38:18 specifically comes to open source then
38:21 you look if team have an understanding
38:23 of
38:25 like how the community is going to
38:26 develop how large it is right and how
38:30 are they going to capture the value they
38:32 create right is it just products that
38:35 people will use or there is potential
38:37 for uh making money out of it yeah yeah
38:41 and and what you said first it's more
38:43 about this okay what is my idea of
38:46 growing my community like do I have a
38:48 plan on I don't know technical marketing
38:50 do I have tried out different ways of
38:51 growing the community and and do I have
38:54 a plan on how to do it
38:57 um but yeah what you said is that's it
38:58 yeah
39:00 you know
39:01 but uh we did talk a bit about the
39:05 GitHub stars and oh what you said that
39:08 this is not the most important metric
39:10 but you still look at this sometimes
39:12 right because it gives you an idea of
39:14 how discoverable it is and
39:18 um
39:19 so at that you do look but like for you
39:21 maybe the important part is not the
39:23 amount of stars but
39:25 like if there are any stars at all
39:28 no what I said what I said was more
39:30 about if there are no stars and it's a
39:31 private repo I cannot find it so I
39:33 cannot invest it all so it's more of
39:35 this like stars are a great discovery
39:37 metric for me to discover projects
39:39 myself but you really also have to set
39:43 this in in perspective with this with
39:46 the project they're working on for
39:47 example if you're working on some kind
39:49 of something in the generative AI space
39:51 in the last months you would have a good
39:53 chance to have a lot a high amount of
39:55 stars of people just being curious
39:56 putting a star there as a bookmark and
39:59 that's it if you're having a project and
40:01 having I don't know 5000 stars but no
40:03 active people does not worth anything if
40:06 you have a 100 stars but but I don't
40:09 know 20 people actively engaging on your
40:11 on your Discord every day I would say
40:14 that this could be could be more
40:16 valuable
40:17 um as an early stage company so
40:21 um yeah the stars are a metric you have
40:24 to set them in perspective
40:26 um it can show how you adopt uh how
40:30 people adopt your product but it it
40:33 cannot show everything and it's it's
40:35 often a kind of vanity metric also
40:39 um yeah
40:40 but having a good number of stars is
40:43 actually a good thing because I know
40:44 when you have yeah many stars in one day
40:47 then you get into the trending GitHub
40:51 trending part and then this is how your
40:54 project can be found by other people and
40:56 is this how you discover projects
40:58 yourself you go to GitHub trending and
41:00 look at the projects there
41:02 and the problem there is that those
41:04 projects um also most of the times too
41:06 late for us as an investment uh right
41:09 because
41:11 um that's that's also what is like if
41:13 they have 5 000 stars for example and
41:15 more and they have a great team and they
41:17 have a great
41:18 um idea of how to
41:21 um how to
41:23 commercialize it and it's a big problem
41:25 most of the times they already have an
41:27 investment because
41:29 it is quite transparent like
41:34 so
41:35 um so it is great to discover the
41:37 projects that are all like still a
41:39 little smaller but have an engaging
41:41 community that have this kind of spike
41:44 in Stars after you invested it's better
41:46 than than before you invested right
41:49 um so uh yeah but it also depends on the
41:53 case
41:55 um and and who you're building for but
41:57 in general
41:59 um stars is is good and bad and and
42:02 um
42:04 you can track you can track it you can
42:06 you can look at it but it shouldn't be
42:08 like oh I invest only above 2 000 stars
42:12 and uh with this kind of star growth
42:14 rate and yeah
42:17 so if a project isn't trending for you
42:20 most likely it's already too late to
42:22 invest in this project how do you
42:24 actually find projects to invest in
42:27 so a lot in in venture capital in
42:30 general is Network
42:33 um so knowing people who are knowing
42:35 people who are knowing people
42:37 um but it's also for us more and more
42:40 I'm looking and I'm screening in GitHub
42:43 I have my my search queries where I look
42:46 for startups
42:48 um a lot of VCS also do data driven
42:51 sourcing where they have
42:54 um yeah automated yeah I think it's it's
42:56 it's uh what data driven sourcing means
42:59 but
43:01 um yeah and then it's also inbound right
43:03 so people who are getting in contact
43:06 with you
43:08 um who are texting you hey I'm building
43:10 this and that so I think like inbound
43:12 outbound
43:13 um are the other two most important and
43:15 then you have Network which is also a
43:17 kind of an inbound Channel but but more
43:19 qualified and more
43:21 um and and a little bit less but um the
43:24 people know you the people know what
43:25 you're looking at and um those are I
43:28 think the most most important
43:30 um and then you for sure look at at uh
43:32 yeah GitHub for example product hunt
43:35 different other newsletters that are
43:38 sending out uh tooling that is in beta
43:41 and
43:43 um your ad conferences you are uh
43:46 talking with accelerators
43:49 um
43:49 yeah
43:51 a lot of different ways and there's also
43:53 no recipe I would say that there is a
43:56 lot of
43:57 stuff coming from the network but
44:00 um you cannot rely on that so A lot of
44:02 people are building up other ways to
44:04 find cool stuff
44:06 um in the market
44:08 yeah so for you how large how much time
44:12 do you spend on discovering projects on
44:16 discovering products I really have to
44:19 tell that this
44:21 um has a little bit to do of what what
44:23 kind of things I have on my on my desk
44:25 so I there's a phases where I work close
44:27 with some of our portfolio companies or
44:30 working on some internal projects or um
44:33 are really uh digging deep on on one or
44:35 two startups we're looking at right now
44:37 so then I have done not that much time
44:38 but I try to allocate
44:41 minimum uh
44:43 uh two hours in the morning normally to
44:45 to sourcing we have a quite narrow scope
44:50 um with this Niche so it's quite
44:52 it's quite quite easy to have a kind of
44:57 good overview there
44:58 if you for sure see not everything
45:00 especially the pre-launch stuff that is
45:03 made by people I don't know were just
45:06 thinking about leaving their big tech
45:08 company and and know uh some some VC
45:12 investors from from their lunch and and
45:14 then just make the deal before it's
45:16 public right
45:17 therefore you need the network for those
45:19 people
45:21 um but yeah for outbound sourcing I try
45:24 to allocate some hours every morning
45:27 um to stay stay on top of that
45:29 the outbound is when you find something
45:32 interesting and then you reach out to
45:34 people I have to outreach because they
45:36 don't know me yeah yeah and inbound is
45:39 when somebody does not know
45:41 when you some you don't know somebody
45:43 but they found you somehow for example
45:45 by watching this interview right and say
45:48 okay I want to write this person and
45:51 pitch my product my idea yeah or or for
45:55 example if I know someone who's getting
45:58 in touch with with someone else and and
46:00 investors are not only investing alone
46:03 right so we co-invest with a lot of also
46:05 bigger funds and smaller funds and
46:06 Angels so if they are seeing something
46:08 cool which we
46:10 um would fit with
46:12 um they're also saying hey have you seen
46:14 this do you want me to connect you to
46:17 them
46:18 um so yeah but those are the the ways
46:20 that we get in contact with uh full
46:22 stuff
46:23 and speaking of inbound leads or I don't
46:26 know what's the right term uh
46:29 when somebody contacts you how can they
46:32 make good impression
46:34 how can we they pitch their project in
46:37 such a way that you would actually
46:39 decide talking to them
46:42 I mean the the bare minimum look at what
46:47 um what we are doing
46:49 and if you're in this vertical building
46:51 something in in uh especially developer
46:55 stack I mean B2B software in general but
46:59 especially developers Tech I'm happy to
47:01 have like any kind of request like you
47:04 can just tell hey I I saw you there I
47:07 just discovered you I heard from you
47:08 about whatever
47:10 um I'm building in this and that space
47:12 do you want to talk here's my calendar
47:14 whatever I didn't it doesn't need to be
47:16 like this this amount because we are
47:19 only looking at a narrow Niche and there
47:21 are not 200 people a day outreaching me
47:23 or if if they're not even looking what
47:26 I'm interested in that's for example I
47:28 would say a logo so if you're looking at
47:30 some investor also an angel please look
47:33 at what kind of deals they're normally
47:35 doing and if you're fitting that
47:38 um and not just spamming spamming uh to
47:42 any people you find on LinkedIn who has
47:45 investor in somewhere in their profile
47:46 but look at them and then maybe you also
47:50 have one line about why you two could
47:54 match together right I saw that you
47:56 focus on this and that and I saw your
47:57 investment in XYZ
48:00 that fits perfectly because I'm building
48:02 whatever and then then I'm always happy
48:04 to talk with everyone
48:06 um because it's always great to have
48:07 exchange even if it does not lead in the
48:10 end to an investment but
48:11 um yes I'm happy for for everyone to
48:14 who's building in this space to to
48:15 message me
48:17 um so yeah
48:19 LinkedIn right so if it doesn't doesn't
48:21 have to be like a paragraph like this so
48:24 um it's it's it's it's good to have like
48:27 a short short um wrap up and and maybe a
48:30 link to the project or the website or
48:32 deck or whatever
48:33 um so but yeah LinkedIn is the main the
48:36 main way
48:37 um I mean you can
48:40 theoretically contact me on Twitter I'm
48:42 not really active there you can I think
48:45 also via GitHub there's my mail there
48:48 but I think LinkedIn is the the easiest
48:51 way
48:52 um that's how we got in touch I think
48:55 through Linkedin yeah yeah I think
48:57 LinkedIn
48:58 um because I think I messaged you
48:59 because of the open source spotlights as
49:01 you mentioned before right because
49:03 um yeah a lot of also a lot of companies
49:05 where we already invested in also are
49:07 featured there and it's a great way to
49:09 to present your project
49:11 um to to a big Community that's that's
49:14 amazing that was a very nice unexpected
49:17 uh surprise because I did not think it
49:20 would be used in such a way it was very
49:22 pleasant to know that uh it's not just
49:24 developers who look at open source
49:26 Spotlight
49:28 um yeah we have a question which is
49:30 quite related to what we just talked
49:31 about the question is we are building a
49:35 conversational data tool some parts will
49:37 be open sourced while some other parts
49:40 will remain closed source uh would you
49:43 consider this model
49:46 um yeah definitely like this this open
49:48 core I would say uh startup model is
49:50 something that is really
49:53 um yeah familiar and a lot of people
49:55 work with this so you don't have to
49:58 for me like I'm not the religious open
50:01 source guy
50:02 um I have to tell so for me it's not
50:04 about you have to have everything open
50:06 source MIT licensed and
50:09 um don't make money out of it
50:12 um it's great that you have an idea of
50:15 I put this in that open source and it
50:17 helps me with this and that
50:19 so if you have a reasoning behind it and
50:21 if you also have a reasoning behind
50:23 doing something not open source that's
50:25 amazing so and if you're building
50:28 something totally in in a proprietary
50:30 and you have very good reasoning for it
50:32 that's also fine so
50:36 um if you think about what you do and if
50:38 you have a good reasoning behind it you
50:40 can do uh open core you can have
50:44 um all full open source and only sell
50:46 Enterprise licenses you can do whatever
50:47 you want if you reason it in a good way
50:50 I would say so definitely I think
50:52 commercial open source in in this kind
50:54 of open core model where you have
50:56 proprietary features and a hosted
50:58 version of that is also I would say the
51:01 most
51:02 a prominent model I see with a newer and
51:05 younger open source startups
51:08 so we have open core which is a model
51:12 where there are some features that are
51:13 closed
51:15 and they offer like a cloud version of
51:18 the tool like a hosted first so you
51:21 don't have to host this thing yourself
51:23 what are the other models of monetizing
51:27 commercializing and open source project
51:29 in addition yeah one of the most classic
51:33 ways are just selling Enterprise
51:34 licenses right also on-prem licenses
51:37 because it depends on what license you
51:40 have
51:41 are you able to really host it yourself
51:43 and then
51:45 but the the hosted versions are really
51:47 the number one I would say
51:50 um and and there you have the difference
51:51 between the ones who have proprietary
51:53 features versus the ones who just have a
51:55 a better user experience and not the
51:58 hassle with the data and so on and so
52:00 forth uh you don't need some devops you
52:02 don't need uh
52:04 anyone to configure it
52:06 um so this would be just hosted hosted
52:09 open source
52:10 um but then you really have to look at
52:12 at the license because you don't want
52:14 any big cloud providers just just host
52:16 it and and make money out of what you
52:18 build
52:20 um so you should think about the license
52:22 twice but
52:25 um yeah selling selling Enterprise and
52:27 Prime licenses is possible
52:30 um
52:30 [Music]
52:33 license also with uh proprietary
52:36 features is you can mix this kind of
52:38 different licenses different features
52:40 you can mix and match that as you want
52:42 and you really have to think about who's
52:45 your users and what problem are you
52:47 solving for them and what kind of
52:49 business model or what kind of service
52:52 do they want right if if they're if
52:55 you're really in a regulator really
52:56 regulated industry
52:59 um selling to I don't know fintechs or
53:01 financial industry players handling a
53:03 lot of data maybe it's better for you to
53:06 work with a proprietary Enterprise
53:08 license or an Enterprise license of your
53:11 open source version
53:13 um with additional features so without
53:15 or with support
53:17 um which is not really the most like
53:20 model for investors because it's not
53:22 that scalable
53:24 um but um so there are a lot of
53:26 different ways you just have to find the
53:28 the best way for your customers and your
53:31 financial interest right yeah
53:34 so when it comes to this Enterprise
53:36 licenses I guess the gist the idea
53:38 behind it is that I as an individual can
53:41 use this software for free
53:43 but if I want to make it if I want to
53:47 use it for a commercial activity
53:50 productivity that generates some money
53:53 yeah let's say it work then I have to
53:56 pay
53:57 yeah yeah and there are models without
53:59 additional features for these licenses
54:01 with them without whatever but yeah
54:03 that's the that's the model I would say
54:06 and the last one you mentioned support
54:07 is like let's say I have one I would say
54:10 the oldest model right I'm not that long
54:12 in the industry uh but I would say like
54:15 that's the the the the the old school
54:17 model of supporting
54:20 um your open source models which is
54:22 running on-prem on your users
54:25 um instances
54:26 yeah so the idea is that there is a open
54:30 source project
54:31 but it's not sometimes you need help to
54:35 run this project right and then you have
54:37 to configuring it
54:39 um building up the infrastructure for it
54:41 and so yeah yeah so then you talk to the
54:44 project team and they help you so as I
54:47 said this is maybe great for
54:49 bootstrapping but this is not really
54:51 liked I would say by investors because
54:52 it's not scalable you always have to
54:54 think if you want to go the investment
54:56 route you have to figure out investment
54:59 model which is scalable which which kind
55:01 of you don't need one more employee for
55:04 more Revenue but you can scale the
55:06 revenue without at some point scaling up
55:10 um your employees at the same amount
55:11 right this this kind of Leverage in the
55:13 long term
55:15 um I think a lot of investors want to
55:16 see that
55:18 so if you want to do if you want to
55:20 bootstrap then fine but if you want to
55:23 look for investment then probably you
55:25 should think of other ways of
55:27 commercializing your product right yeah
55:30 yeah yeah
55:33 um another question what do you think
55:36 um how do you think open source will
55:38 look in the future will it become more
55:40 popular or less popular what's your
55:42 opinion on that
55:44 I think
55:46 I guess we're we're just at the start of
55:49 I I know that like I also have the
55:52 feeling that there are more and more and
55:54 more open source players and also some
55:55 doing the same
55:57 but if you look at the proprietary
55:59 startup ecosystem you see 10 20 ones
56:03 doing just exactly the same boring stuff
56:05 so sorry to say it that way but
56:09 um so we are not there not near there
56:12 and there are only a few Niche
56:16 applications where open source is the
56:19 status quo
56:21 and I think there is a possibility that
56:23 we get there that open source uh players
56:26 will be the dominant players in a lot of
56:28 those those market and not only the
56:30 challengers but the ones who are
56:32 dominating it
56:34 um
56:34 I think we have to work on a lot of
56:37 things to go there but
56:39 um you've seen it so with databases
56:42 where we are now today with with a lot
56:44 of Open Source databases I mean they're
56:46 hosted in the end a lot of times with
56:48 the big cloud providers but
56:51 um yeah I I think there are chance there
56:54 is a chance that open source will
56:57 um yeah
56:58 go further and and we will see uh some
57:02 some big
57:04 um Market leaders there because I don't
57:06 really think that we really have them
57:08 yet
57:10 um I I I look at a lot of open source
57:12 and so I also have the feeling that
57:14 there is already a lot but if you then
57:17 look into other
57:18 um areas you will see
57:20 yeah it's it it's just it's it's still
57:23 small
57:26 do you know any more or less recent uh
57:30 success stories so for companies doing
57:33 open source because they know of course
57:34 there is Linux like red heart companies
57:36 like that yeah it has been around for a
57:38 very long time uh or I know my sequel or
57:42 yeah Oracle like they have been doing
57:44 like I don't know Java for for years
57:46 yeah we also know I know personal
57:49 elasticsearch even despite the
57:52 difficulties with I don't know AWS they
57:55 had they had a problem with AWS hosting
57:58 elasticsearch and not paying anything uh
58:01 it's still I think kind of a success
58:03 story because they they are successful
58:06 startup they do make money but it's also
58:09 relatively old
58:11 company do you know any recent uh
58:13 successful open source companies
58:17 so
58:18 I would say that also for them it's
58:21 only be said like after a few more years
58:24 if they're really success like even ones
58:26 like like like elastic like
58:28 hashikop they're all right now at the
58:31 pot like they're all on the public
58:32 markets right now right they're all
58:33 stock listed companies and they're still
58:35 fighting uh with the capital markets
58:37 about their profitability so what is the
58:39 success it's always hard to tell but
58:41 they're for sure uh some promising
58:43 companies that close larger funding
58:45 grounds in in the recent past so in so
58:48 far you see this as a success it it's at
58:51 least a sign for Success so there are
58:53 the one says for example Super Bass
58:56 which building a platform as a service a
58:58 hugging phase for sure
59:01 um Kong the the API management platform
59:04 Apollo the graphql platform I think they
59:09 raise big rounds I cannot tell
59:12 um if they're really gonna be
59:15 multi-billion dollar companies but we
59:17 see signs of there are some cool next
59:20 there are a couple of
59:22 ones who could be the next Monger to be
59:25 the next elastic the next hashikov
59:28 um and there are also some some smaller
59:29 projects still also in Germany uh who
59:32 who where we are both located
59:35 um which are a little earlier but still
59:38 very promising right you see you see a
59:41 good part
59:42 um that that has quite good traction you
59:44 see and the vector DB space you see a
59:46 quadrant you see a deep Set uh who are
59:49 not the biggest projects yet but also a
59:52 great way for open source companies from
59:54 from Germany
59:56 um and from Europe so not the amount of
59:59 funding that that the ones like super
1:00:00 bass have but we see uh the different
1:00:04 stages of of those companies are getting
1:00:07 filled so yeah
1:00:10 and then there is a comment from
1:00:11 Alexandro saying that neo4j is a good
1:00:13 example they have a good open source
1:00:16 project yeah yes Enterprise package well
1:00:19 last question for you we are we should
1:00:21 be wrapping up and the question if there
1:00:23 if you know any good book or other
1:00:25 resource that you can recommend to the
1:00:27 listeners or somebody who want to learn
1:00:29 who wants to learn more about investing
1:00:32 um things we talked about today
1:00:35 okay it it depends on investing I would
1:00:38 say like in the community building uh
1:00:40 kind of kind of way in this open source
1:00:42 community building and I there's an
1:00:45 article I can later send you send you
1:00:47 some documents about it
1:00:49 um which is
1:00:51 um from crowdf actually about their top
1:00:53 six books on developed community
1:00:55 building which I think is really
1:00:57 important for early stage Founders who
1:00:58 are building open source to understand
1:01:00 this so this is not the investment part
1:01:02 there's also a great
1:01:05 um article from Bessemer Ventures
1:01:09 um Venture Capital there it's a big BC
1:01:12 fund it's it's already from 2020 but
1:01:14 it's about
1:01:15 um open source metrics in investing I
1:01:18 think this could be could be interesting
1:01:22 um books about investing investing in
1:01:25 general
1:01:27 um
1:01:28 I I can maybe send you sent you
1:01:30 something some something afterwards I
1:01:32 would say
1:01:34 um that despite everything that he is
1:01:36 doing personally zero to one from from
1:01:39 Peter teal is a good book to uh start
1:01:42 with startups
1:01:44 um and and to um
1:01:46 yeah
1:01:48 and Peter Thiel is an investor right
1:01:52 uh he's he's
1:01:54 found PayPal I think right and and then
1:01:57 he's one of the First Investors in in
1:02:00 Facebook and uh having the founders fund
1:02:03 and he's an investor he's a quiet I
1:02:06 would say a difficult person and types
1:02:09 of his uh political uh thoughts but
1:02:14 um despite that the book zero to one is
1:02:17 recommendable
1:02:19 okay on that note I want to thank you
1:02:22 for investing your time one hour to talk
1:02:26 to us and share everything you learn or
1:02:29 at least everything I asked you and uh
1:02:32 yeah thanks for that and thanks everyone
