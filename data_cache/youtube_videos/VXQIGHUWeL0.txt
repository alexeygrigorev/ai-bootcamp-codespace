0:00 everyone Welcome to our event this event
0:02 is brought to you by data talks club
0:04 which is a community of people who love
0:06 data we have fre events and today today
0:09 is one of such events it's been a while
0:12 since we had our last podcast interview
0:16 I think it was in June or July yeah so
0:18 we had a summer break so now we're
0:21 finally uh kids went to school today in
0:23 Germany l in Berlin and we are starting
0:27 to continue our interviews and other
0:31 events so welcome everyone and uh if you
0:34 want to find out more about the events

1:47 prepared
1:49 and yeah one thing before we start I
1:52 want to make sure I pronounce your name
1:53 correctly it's Rachel yeah Rachel
1:58 Rachel okay Rachel so let's
2:02 start um so this week we'll talk about
2:05 using data to create livable cities and
2:09 we have a special guest today
2:10 Rachel and Rachel is an urban data
2:13 scientist who is dedicated um to
2:17 creating liable cities through
2:19 Innovative use of
2:20 data and
2:23 uh excuse
2:27 me yeah so welcome Rachel to our
2:31 interview thank you hi happy to be here
2:34 today I've benefited greatly from the
2:36 data talks club's causes and I'm happy
2:39 to be here to share my
2:40 experience yeah we're happy to have you
2:43 so let's start before we go into our
2:46 main topic let's start with your
2:48 background can you tell us about your
2:51 career Journey so far yes I am currently
2:54 working as a data engineer in Singapore
2:56 and I'm dedicated to creating livable
2:58 cities through the use of data data I
3:01 combined my background in geography I
3:03 have a bachelor's in geography and a
3:05 masters in urban data science where I
3:07 blend qualitative and quantitative
3:09 analysis to tackle Urban challenges I
3:12 started my career in data science
3:14 applying my skills in analytics and
3:16 machine learning to various transport
3:18 problems projects I have worked on
3:20 include B sharing analytics to C
3:22 indiscriminate parking as well as Road
3:24 defect detection using computer vision
3:27 and through these use cases I've had the
3:28 opportunity to a real impact in CDs and
3:32 the satisfaction of seeing my my work
3:34 leading to tangible Solutions motivated
3:36 me to become a transport scientist where
3:38 I focus on analyzing travel patterns to
3:41 shape long-term planning in Singapore
3:44 and to further enhance my impact I
3:46 recently transited to data engineering
3:48 after taking on the data talks Club data
3:50 engineering course and by diving into
3:53 Data foundations and building data
3:55 platforms I ultimately aim to optimize
3:58 AI applications for cre Lio cities MH
4:02 yeah amazing so how was the course it
4:05 was good really I think it got do into a
4:09 lot about building data pipelines and
4:11 using M as well which was quite an eye
4:13 opener and I think it was quite relevant
4:16 in helping me transit into this current
4:18 road that I'm in MH you said you were a
4:22 transport scientist right did I yes hear
4:25 the name correctly so what do you like
4:28 it's not uh so for for example I used to
4:31 work at an e-commerce company there was
4:33 not such a role as transport scientist
4:35 so I imagine there are certain types of
4:39 Institutions that need this role so I'm
4:42 wondering what the role is and who
4:44 actually needs transport
4:46 scientists um I think predominantly in
4:50 the in the government sector where I'm
4:52 working in where we do um transportation
4:56 planning and really Transportation
4:59 scientist is combining data science but
5:02 doing it in a very applied manner in the
5:06 public transport or like transport
5:08 planning few another few I would imagine
5:10 would be transport consultancy for
5:12 example like Sam
5:14 Schwartz yeah so I think this two key
5:16 Fields mainly but really it's about
5:19 applying data science in a urban context
5:23 MH so which which means like planning
5:27 where to put bus stops or how often
5:30 buses should go or things like that yeah
5:34 that's part of the things but we we
5:36 separate it into more short-term and
5:39 long-term planning so in the short term
5:41 we look at bus routes we look at um um
5:45 frequency what is the travel patterns
5:47 how are how are the services holding up
5:51 like how well is it serving the the the
5:54 transport users and the in the long term
5:56 we also use um travel patterns we do
6:01 projections and use this to do long-term
6:05 planning in the form of whether
6:07 additional roads will be required
6:09 whether additional Rail lines will be
6:11 required and what would the alignment
6:14 be interesting so I guess um so let's
6:19 say there are a bunch of buses in
6:21 Singapore each bus I assume has a sensor
6:24 right and you track this you track
6:26 delays uh you also track how many people
6:29 are on that bus right uh things like
6:33 that and through with this information
6:35 then you can see okay like this bus uh
6:40 is always occupied like there there are
6:42 too many people in the bus maybe we
6:44 should go more often right things like
6:46 that yes for sure there a combination of
6:49 data that we look at so we have
6:51 transponders on the bus that tracks the
6:53 the location of the bus by GPS so this
6:56 way we know whether there are the buses
6:58 what time the bus are reaching the bus
7:00 stop whether there are issues related to
7:02 bus punching which is essentially two
7:05 buses of the same service number hitting
7:08 the same bus stop at the same time so
7:10 this way ideally we would want it to be
7:13 to be spaced out in a in a frequency
7:15 rather than having multiple buses
7:17 reaching the same stock at the same time
7:19 that way we are not really optimizing
7:21 the other side of things would be so
7:24 that's more of like the supply side and
7:25 more from the demand side we look at
7:27 Fair cut data which we track where
7:30 people are tapping in and tapping out so
7:32 this way we get a better sense of travel
7:34 demand mhm what do you mean by taping
7:37 and taping tap so in Singapore we use a
7:41 fair cut data I think in many cities
7:43 like for example in London you have the
7:44 oyster cart in New York you have the
7:46 Metro cut so in Singapore we have we
7:49 have a fair cut system as well so going
7:52 into a public transport system whether
7:54 is it going into train station you would
7:56 have to tap in and when you get out you
7:57 have to tap out same for bus you have a
8:00 card and then there's like some sort of
8:02 reader right and you it's contactless
8:05 yeah contactless transport yeah
8:07 interestingly in Berlin like people can
8:10 just hop on the bus without doing
8:12 anything and then just sit and like
8:15 sometimes there's control sometimes
8:16 there's not
8:19 and you don't get to collect the
8:22 information oh maybe like there are
8:25 there are cameras in the bus but it
8:27 makes the collection process way more
8:30 difficult CU you need to like look at
8:32 the data at the at videos yeah then you
8:36 need to apply computer vision on it yeah
8:39 instead of just looking at the events
8:40 and then doing count and that's it
8:44 interesting and what did actually
8:46 motivate you to uh work on this
8:49 intersection and work on geography and
8:53 data
8:54 science um growing up in Singapore I was
8:57 very fascinated by the intricate systems
9:00 that shape cities and I also witnessed
9:02 firsthand how Singapore developed from
9:05 this we had this very rapid expansion of
9:07 the MRT Network as well as the
9:09 development of new housing Estates and I
9:11 became very intrigued by this forces so
9:14 this motivated me to go more into the
9:16 study of geography and on top of that I
9:19 did an internship in the center for
9:21 liable cities which deepen my
9:24 understanding of the complexities
9:25 involved in creating um sustainable
9:28 Urban environments and through the
9:31 internship I also had the opportunity to
9:33 attend the world city submit which was
9:36 really inspired by a global community
9:38 that is united in the pursuit of of
9:40 creating better cities so through this
9:42 Summit city leaders from all over the
9:44 world would come together and share
9:46 ideas on how to make cities better and
9:49 then I begin my academic Journey
9:51 focusing on geography more specifically
9:54 focusing on Urban Design GE computation
9:56 as well as Jo spatial analytics and then
9:59 this led on to quite naturally actually
10:02 going more into data science which I
10:05 then pursued a masters in urban
10:07 informatics at at New York University so
10:10 it was a course that specialized in
10:13 applying data science in the urban
10:15 context so this interesting kind of led
10:18 me into my current
10:19 role yeah because like my views on uh
10:23 what I know about G geography is super
10:26 limited because uh it's limited to
10:28 school and at school we were mostly
10:31 studying like what is the capital of
10:33 what and um you know things like that
10:38 um different I think types of I don't
10:41 even remember like oceans and uh whatnot
10:44 pic
10:45 plates and earthquakes right like and I
10:48 wasn't the best student so like this
10:49 kind of passed by me without staying in
10:52 my head much so yeah that's why for me
10:56 it's always interesting to know like
10:58 what actually geog ists do and then you
11:01 mention one of the things is Urban
11:03 Design which I guess means like okay we
11:08 need to put we need to maybe build a new
11:12 uh a new District right and then some
11:14 houses and then of course there should
11:16 be a school there should be kindergarten
11:18 how large should be the school or how
11:19 many schools this is things like that
11:21 right so this is what you mean by Urban
11:23 Design or it's something it's something
11:25 else it is that but on top of it to make
11:28 the design it in a way that it is um
11:32 liveable for people to leave in so how
11:36 yeah Parks how do you make sheets more
11:39 walkable how do you design sheets like
11:41 certain width of of sheets how do you do
11:44 you put like uh a side where do you put
11:46 a sidewalk do you add another like row
11:49 of like cter boxes around keep it away
11:51 from traffic do you make a area safe how
11:55 do you make an area safer and how do you
11:57 make people want to Linger on the
11:59 streets rather than just walk through it
12:02 how do you create communities through
12:04 the design of
12:07 streets understand why is it called
12:10 Geographic geography like what does it
12:14 have to do with like all the things we
12:16 studied at
12:19 school I'm just curious like what does
12:22 it have to do with like all the things
12:24 we studied at school like why is it
12:26 still called geography like why is it a
12:28 part of geography that's what I'm
12:30 wondering I think geography beyond the
12:33 physical sense that's also the the human
12:35 aspect of things so in the physical
12:36 sense includes things that we study in
12:38 school like PL tectonics about volcanoes
12:41 and earthquakes but the other side of
12:43 geography is about the human geography
12:45 where we study things like um people
12:47 migration population changes and this
12:50 are
12:51 very are things that we see around us
12:54 every day so I think that's what that's
12:57 what makes geography so fascinating
12:59 because whatever you study you see it
13:02 happening in the railro and things that
13:04 you do can directly feed back into into
13:11 changes and uh yeah so I was just taking
13:14 notes of things that we talked about so
13:16 we talked about like
13:19 um things that make a city more liable
13:23 which are parks like different lines for
13:27 pedestrians uh for cars s traffic signs
13:31 and then you also mentioned communities
13:33 like somehow you want to create space
13:37 for people to feel like belong that they
13:40 belong things like that so what else do
13:43 we need for a livable City like how
13:46 would you define a livable
13:49 City to me a livable city is a place
13:52 where people feel connected to their
13:53 community and have the opportunities to
13:56 thrive so physically in the build
13:59 environment this can translate into a
14:01 multitude and combination of things so
14:04 firstly more um like efficient public
14:06 transport where you have a
14:07 well-connected network of buses trains
14:10 as well as Bike Share programs and
14:12 production friendly
14:13 streets um good safe and cycling cycling
14:17 and walking infrastructure where we
14:19 could see dedicated bike Lanes pession
14:21 walkways and
14:23 crosswalks infrastructure that can
14:25 accommodate to different needs um such
14:28 as people with disabil ities um it can
14:30 also translate into affordable housing
14:33 proximity to amenities where homes are
14:36 located near essential Services as well
14:38 as Queen spaces so all this creates a a
14:42 buil environment where where people feel
14:45 safe people can connect to their
14:47 neighbors and people are happy to leave
14:49 in essentially and I think Beyond this
14:52 increasingly it also trans it goes
14:56 beyond the physical infrastructure space
14:58 and to also the digital realm in the
15:01 form of a city with strong digital
15:03 infrastructure that supports the needs
15:04 of its residents and businesses so
15:07 digitally could include things like um
15:10 access to online access to government
15:12 services um digital safety and being
15:16 able to connect residents on digital
15:19 platforms as well since we now know that
15:22 a lot of people are actually spending
15:24 more time in the digital space so
15:26 there's a need to to merge these two
15:28 spaces
15:30 how well is Singapore doing when it
15:32 comes to Lial City I must admit I have
15:34 never been to Singapore I want to visit
15:38 it at some point but you should visit I
15:40 definitely should yeah but like how
15:43 well how livable it is how would you say
15:48 I think we
15:49 have grown a lot over time essentially
15:53 we had a phase whereby we were very
15:55 focused on on growing and developing
15:58 housing as States and increasingly
16:00 there's a lot more focus on Place making
16:03 creating spaces where people can linger
16:05 and enjoy and also we have a movement
16:07 whereby we are converting streets or or
16:10 the streets into Carree zones so this
16:13 increases um the the envir improves the
16:17 environment for people to walk to cycle
16:20 and we are also creating dedicated bike
16:22 lenss so I think it is a journey there
16:25 are parts of the cities that are better
16:28 more liveable than than others and we
16:30 are working on it to to make it to make
16:33 more spaces like this mhm yeah and um
16:38 what's unique about Singapore is it's
16:41 geographically quite small right so and
16:44 it's very densely populated so you have
16:46 to be very how to say effective about
16:50 how you use land right yeah that's why
16:53 you need to think about these things
16:55 it's a very conscious planning process
16:59 and land planning in Singapore there's
17:02 this process called Master planning
17:04 where we plan a hit like 15 some 15
17:06 years in advance so we know where
17:08 certain ameni should be how do things
17:11 come together across different time
17:15 points okay interesting because like I
17:18 was thinking since I live in Berlin of
17:19 course I was thinking like how livable
17:21 it is I think it's doing pretty well
17:23 like there's good public
17:25 transport uh I wouldn't say cycling is
17:28 really
17:29 great here there
17:31 are areas where there are more um bike
17:36 paths there are areas with fewer of them
17:39 um like and I can compare it to Moscow
17:42 for example in Moscow for people with
17:44 disabilities it's super difficult to
17:46 move around like in Berlin I can see
17:49 quite a few of them on the
17:52 streets so the city is pretty
17:54 accommodating and that's amazing cuz I
17:56 actually like did not think that that
17:59 this is
18:01 actually I think that people study and
18:03 then go Implement and then actually it's
18:06 not just how to say uh it's very
18:10 practical in a sense that there are data
18:12 scientists there are data Engineers so
18:14 I'm really curious to know what you do
18:17 what you did there as a data scientist
18:19 or transport scientist and what you do
18:21 now as a data
18:23 engineer I think in in data science and
18:26 transport science it planning for City
18:29 requires very deliberate effort and data
18:33 science can play a very pivotal role in
18:35 enhancing the city liability by
18:38 providing valuable insights and enabling
18:40 it in a data driven manner because by by
18:45 leveraging on the data that we collect
18:47 in different parts of the city we can
18:50 know where to optimize where we can
18:53 improve and then lead to better public
18:56 services and environmental
18:57 sustainability
18:59 so um in Singapore we collect quite a
19:03 bit of public data and we also and we
19:05 also share this openly on open data
19:07 platforms so this allows for citizen
19:11 developers or students or research
19:14 bodies to leverage on the data and
19:16 there's some cross exchange of ideas so
19:19 public data in government agencies we
19:22 collect things like Transportation data
19:23 like Fair cut data as mentioned before
19:26 as well as sensors and Survey data so
19:28 using this information we can um be
19:31 better able to understand travel
19:34 patterns and this translate in the long
19:36 term when we do population projections
19:39 we can also use this information to
19:42 project Future travel patterns by
19:45 knowing where people are moving we can
19:47 then plan out and conduct transport
19:50 modeling to see what would be the
19:54 possible
19:56 um alignment of of real lines to bring
19:59 people to places that they need to get
20:01 to and increasingly um actually we are
20:05 also collecting data from from private
20:07 sector which includes things like uh
20:10 Mobility data from right sharing apps so
20:12 this gives us a picture apart from the
20:14 public transport perspective it includes
20:17 information on how taxis are moving how
20:19 are right hailing apps how are people
20:21 moving using like red healing so this
20:25 kind of gives us a glimpse of another
20:28 dimension of people
20:30 movement okay and this is interesting
20:32 because you said you also want to
20:34 predict where people will move like
20:37 which means if I understood
20:40 correctly let's say people are moving
20:43 from one part part from Singapore to
20:45 another slowly maybe there's a district
20:48 that is more conveniently located and
20:51 there's slowly this district is slowly
20:54 getting more populated so you want to
20:56 predict these patterns and understand
20:58 okay okay because there are more and
21:00 more people who live there we need um
21:03 maybe a new bus line or this bus should
21:05 go more often now things like that
21:08 right yes something like that but from
21:11 because Singapore is really small so um
21:14 we plan out how housing Estates would
21:18 develop over time whether is it through
21:20 a new injection of a new housing estate
21:25 or whether is it housing renewal whereby
21:27 we
21:29 rejuvenate a certain area so this way we
21:31 know how many people are living in a
21:33 certain district and from there we can
21:36 rely on past travel patterns and and and
21:38 new modes of transport to predict how
21:41 will people be
21:42 moving in the future potentially so it's
21:45 a it's a projection but we can use that
21:47 to to plan aeit whether is it for for
21:50 new bus lines or for new bus lines if we
21:52 put in a new housing estate we need to
21:54 make sure that is connected to the rest
21:56 of Singapore so then the new lines or
21:59 new bus stops location would be planned
22:00 out that
22:02 way
22:04 mhm I know as a data scientist like you
22:08 cannot do much without data so data
22:10 needs to be there and all this data that
22:12 you mentioned like sensors moving
22:15 patterns right hailing data like it has
22:17 to be there with the scientist to use
22:21 and actually discover patterns and then
22:23 give suggestions and this is probably
22:26 the most difficult part right so like
22:28 but buses need to have like all the
22:30 sensors all the like all the physical
22:34 means of collecting the data and then
22:37 from there it needs to go like the data
22:39 needs to go to some platform where you
22:41 aggregate it somehow process it and then
22:43 put it in a table perhaps a data
22:46 workhouse where data scientists use it
22:49 can you like you as a data
22:51 engineer uh are probably doing these
22:54 things now so can you tell us more about
22:57 what's happening there behind uh under
22:59 the
23:00 hood yes we ingest a combination of data
23:04 so from right Hing companies we collect
23:07 all this GPS location from public
23:10 transport data we also collect um the
23:13 tap in and tap out information as well
23:15 as GPS coordinates so in our data uh in
23:20 our data pipelines we have a end to end
23:22 pipeline whereby we we aggregate all
23:24 this information store it in a data
23:26 warehouse process it in a way that is
23:29 suitable for data analysis Downstream so
23:34 this allows us to to have information
23:37 across uh a long period of time because
23:41 for data science to work we do not just
23:45 need real realtime data but rather in
23:48 order to do projections we need data
23:50 across a long period of time so this
23:52 allows us to to track patterns over time
23:54 which is very important to have stable
23:57 information and reliable data in that
24:01 sense do you also need other also use
24:04 cases where you actually need realtime
24:08 data um for realtime data it's a lot
24:12 more for managing operations so for
24:15 example if we want to know how reliable
24:19 um services are then real time data
24:22 would be a lot more important um one
24:26 potential use cases is also for for the
24:28 tracking of traffic flow during specific
24:32 events so in Singapore we host the F1
24:34 night race so it is because um it is a
24:38 street circuit parts of the roads are
24:40 closed off so we need to know how are
24:43 how our traffic flow around the area
24:45 being impacted so we use um taxi data as
24:49 a proxy because through that we know how
24:51 how fast the GPS coordinates are moving
24:54 whether there is congestion on the
24:55 ground so this gives us an additional
24:57 it's one of the data points that give us
24:59 information on what is how how traffic
25:01 flow is like on the ground when we host
25:03 last scale events like that in the city
25:06 M and what happens if there is a traffic
25:09 jam it depends so if the traffic jam is
25:13 happening on an Express way we have
25:15 cameras on the road that track this
25:18 incident so we know exactly where it's
25:20 happening and Recovery Services will
25:23 come in to either to the service way or
25:26 to to manage the situation on ground mhm
25:29 so like maybe policeman to handle the
25:34 traffic right to arrange it combination
25:36 of traffic Marshals and also services to
25:39 to remove the blockage so that traffic
25:43 can flow
25:45 again I'm just wondering now like I know
25:48 in Berlin it's pretty common to do some
25:52 sort of Runing events like half
25:53 marathons marathons where they block
25:56 like a large Street for half a day and
26:00 then like it's probably quite
26:02 inconvenient for the drivers because
26:04 they need to find a different route and
26:07 C these events like half marathon or
26:10 Marathon the distance is quite large
26:12 like it's like 21 or 42 kilm it means
26:16 like a large very large Rod or multiple
26:20 rods actually have to be
26:21 blocked do you do anything like that in
26:23 Singapore must be a nightmare for like
26:27 for for you to are nice these sort of
26:30 things similar as well we host marathons
26:33 we host like racers in Singapore so um
26:36 for marathons actually we host it on a
26:39 combination of Roads we do close off
26:41 some roads but actually we have a
26:43 network of Park connectors in Singapore
26:46 which connects different parks there are
26:48 places that are actually completely free
26:50 of vehicles so most part of yeah most
26:54 part of the marathons can be conducted
26:56 through like the network of par conect
26:58 like this and some portions of Roads so
27:02 actually the impact of these events on
27:04 on traffic is not as significant mhm
27:08 okay so this is what it actually means
27:10 for a city to be livable right because
27:13 these things are thought through and
27:15 like of course if there are parks that
27:17 are connected you can run without like
27:20 ever stepping across a like having to
27:23 wait for traffic sign to go red or go go
27:26 green right that's a and that makes a
27:29 city definitely liveable cuz I'm I'm
27:31 into running around sometimes and
27:34 finding a route that does not have any
27:39 um like I don't need to wait for a
27:42 traffic light right or I don't need to
27:44 cross the road it's not that easy uh
27:47 yeah so that's that's pretty cool uh do
27:51 you take part in any of these things or
27:53 you mostly take care now of um
27:56 transportation
27:59 in managing these events yeah yeah like
28:03 uh Your Role right now you probably so
28:06 you you used to be a transportation
28:08 scientist and now you're data engineer
28:10 within the same area you also work with
28:14 transport yes I still work in transport
28:17 but I'm working a lot more on data prep
28:20 data pipelines on the Upstream portion
28:23 and also
28:24 increasingly um finding ways to enable
28:28 generative AI in the space of data
28:31 engineering whether is it to allow users
28:34 to query databases without actual
28:38 actually having knowledge of of SQL for
28:41 for
28:42 example how often is it
28:46 needed and often as data Engineers or
28:49 data scientists would get requests from
28:51 users to yeah either extract data or
28:55 help perform a certain analysis so it
28:58 can happen quite frequently so hence
29:01 creating tools to enable users to
29:04 extract insights on their own would be
29:08 would help free up data Engineers time
29:10 to to do other other more Innovative
29:13 things and actually I always believe
29:15 that data science or analysis should
29:18 come from the users because they have
29:21 the best idea of what do they want
29:24 essentially they have Clarity on the on
29:26 the problem statements and a lot of
29:29 analysis will need to be will require
29:32 formulating well-defined problem
29:33 statements with a clear purpose before
29:35 diving into deeper analysis and when
29:38 this gets transferred from like person
29:40 to person sometimes the real essence of
29:43 what you want to find out could be
29:45 diluted so problems need to be
29:47 effectively framed in order for it to be
29:50 solved
29:53 effectively and who are these people who
29:55 don't have uh SQL knowledge but need to
30:01 get this data I assume there are like
30:03 subject matter experts who are not
30:06 necessarily super
30:07 technical right yes yeah subject matters
30:10 it could range from like um people that
30:12 work in policy they need information in
30:15 order to to come up with data driven
30:19 policies for
30:21 example the policy could be can you give
30:24 an example of
30:26 policy um
30:29 it could be like how for example for
30:31 like Fair card information um um or
30:35 things like how do you
30:38 adequately um price
30:42 Transportation how many people are using
30:45 concession cards in order to know
30:48 whether the a policy that you wrot out
30:50 how effectively is it being um how
30:53 effectively is it affecting the the end
30:56 users MH what is a concession cut a
31:01 concession cut is a is a fair cut that
31:03 gives you discounts so like in Singapore
31:06 for senior citizens or students you pay
31:09 a lower Fair yeah MH okay I see so like
31:14 a question could be what happens if we
31:17 now make the price higher
31:19 right or come up with a
31:22 new ticket so for example in Berlin
31:25 there are bundles like you can buy four
31:28 tickets and then it's cheaper like maybe
31:32 a question would be like to get the data
31:33 to an analyze potential impact of I
31:36 think like that right yeah in Singapore
31:38 as well so we have things like um
31:40 monthly passes that gives you like
31:43 unlimited travel for a certain price so
31:46 these are specifically for they they
31:48 passes specifically for students so like
31:52 we possible questions would be how many
31:55 students actually use this passes how
31:58 effective are there um does it how
32:01 what's the percentage of students that
32:03 are using
32:05 thish because they need to actually
32:08 touch this thing to tap in right you
32:10 have all this data but what this
32:14 policy Specialists do not know is how to
32:18 query this data how to get the data they
32:21 need okay and what you do is you
32:24 probably have some sort of like uh
32:28 chat interface where they can just type
32:30 in the thing and then it gets translated
32:32 to a SQL query and they get the answer
32:34 or how does it work um this is something
32:37 that we are looking to build I think um
32:40 we're not there yet so there's a lot of
32:43 effort currently to help help extract
32:46 information or like do analysis so this
32:49 is something that we are hoping that
32:50 would help MH is it something you're
32:54 working on right now yes MH what do you
32:58 what do you use if it's not a secret
33:00 like what kind of Technologies what kind
33:02 of approaches you try uh it's it's
33:05 pretty interesting and we because also
33:06 we right now have this uh llm Zoom camp
33:10 and perhaps this would be interesting
33:12 for our students to also know what are
33:14 the potential applications of llm and
33:18 AI I think the the llm space the text to
33:23 SQL space is very is quite well
33:26 established so that is kind of what we
33:28 are trying to do now um being able to
33:32 use metadata from data warehouses and
33:37 data catalog information from data
33:39 catalog we we chunk them we create a
33:43 vector database from that and then apply
33:45 on top of it a large language model to
33:49 be able to take in user queries in pain
33:52 English and translate it into SQL
33:54 statements before returning um output to
33:58 the users
34:00 mhm so it's uh some sort of a rock
34:04 application where yes instead of so you
34:07 give extra information so like you have
34:11 a plain English query that is a subject
34:13 matter expert creates and then from that
34:16 you create a prompt that this is the
34:19 question from our user that need you
34:21 need to answer using the following
34:22 context and the context you give is all
34:25 the relevant metadata information
34:27 information you get from the data
34:29 warehouse from catalog like this is the
34:31 information about the tables and using
34:33 this information the llm can create a
34:36 SQL query which is then you execute and
34:40 then you return the answer to the user
34:42 is this how it works yes um essentially
34:45 yes it's the process of using
34:47 R so rock in this case the database that
34:51 you query with um like the the the r
34:55 part in rock is the method information
34:58 right yes so it allows the to to
35:02 understand which table to refer to in
35:05 order to extract the right
35:07 [Music]
35:10 information how often the queries you it
35:13 producers the eal queries are not
35:17 working I don't have a fixed number for
35:20 for now but it happens right it's it
35:23 happens for sure it happens
35:25 um I found that goes a lot more with it
35:29 apart from the red portion there's also
35:31 the element of prom engineering whereby
35:34 you need to expose either expose the
35:36 model to sufficient examples of Tex to
35:40 SQL combinations so it knows for what
35:43 type of query what what is the the
35:48 relevant SQL query that you can make
35:50 reference to and also being able to when
35:55 you are quing a database you want you
35:57 users to just be able to querry you
35:59 don't want to include things like insert
36:01 statements update statements or delete
36:03 statements for sure yeah so that are
36:05 additional safeguards that you need to
36:07 make sure that doesn't get doesn't get
36:10 um
36:11 invoked yeah that's a very interesting
36:13 project um yeah and for me I'm right now
36:17 uh interested in uh maybe not collecting
36:22 but learning about as many use cases as
36:24 possible because this is uh fascinating
36:27 area yeah like there are so many things
36:29 we can do now with
36:30 LMS uh yeah that's pretty cool that
36:32 you're doing that too uh right now it's
36:35 in sort of some sort of um Alpha or
36:39 early development state right
36:42 yes yeah um but in general how big the
36:47 data sets like this is not the only
36:49 project you work on right so there are
36:51 probably other more established projects
36:53 that you need to work on like all the
36:55 things we talked about like the trans
36:58 like when it comes to Transportation
36:59 collecting this T tape uh tap in out
37:03 data right is are these um data sets
37:08 large or how large they
37:10 are um yes we have uh we collect a lot
37:15 of information so for fair cut data
37:17 Alone um in Singapore we collect like um
37:22 millions of data per day of Passenger
37:25 flow so this gives us a lot of data
37:28 points because by analyzing Fair cut
37:30 data we can track passenger flows
37:32 between stations identify the peak
37:34 travel times and also access the
37:36 popularity of different routes routes so
37:39 then this allows us to to go more in
37:42 depth into things like route
37:43 optimization or like Fair structure
37:46 optimization so back to the the topic
37:49 about policy right by analyzing Fair cut
37:51 data we can help determine what is the
37:54 optimal Fair structure so for example in
37:56 Singapore we have the public transport
37:58 Council where we one of the policies
38:01 that was implemented was um morning
38:04 preck fast which allow commuter to enjoy
38:08 um savings if they tap in before 7:45 in
38:11 the morning so this essentially the
38:14 intent is to shift travel demand away
38:17 from the pick hours and a train loading
38:20 because everyone is going to want to to
38:22 hit the station at like 8:30 9:00 a.m.
38:24 and get to work so by introducing this
38:28 policy we encourage people to travel
38:30 early and pay less
38:33 MH and these um millions of data points
38:38 that you collect how exactly are they
38:41 processed like do you use like the usual
38:44 tools like Kafka and uh I don't know uh
38:48 like a data Lake data warehouse or you
38:51 have something specific and like how
38:54 even data comes from the bus like do you
38:57 have some sorts of transmitters there uh
39:00 before they end up in your kfka or
39:03 whatever yes we have sensors on the bus
39:05 that collects location information and
39:08 from the the the fair cut systems the
39:11 gantries we collect those data and it's
39:14 start in a real time like the moment I
39:17 tap in I already have an event somewhere
39:20 or like at the end of the day you get
39:25 the data from the bus the data is
39:28 thought but um the aggregation happens
39:33 afterwards because in Singapore we have
39:36 the concept of a right and a journey so
39:38 for rights we we allow Our Fair
39:41 structure is such that we allow you um
39:44 commuters to have multiple rights and
39:47 make transfers between
39:49 trips within a 45 minute period and we
39:52 consider that a journey so then we
39:55 compute the fast using distance
39:57 so hence we do not process it in real
40:01 time it
40:03 happens after a Time La so this allows
40:06 us to like aggregate all this
40:08 information before storing it in a data
40:11 warehouse and we use a combination of
40:12 like cuf car and and P SP to process the
40:16 information M but there's probably I
40:19 think that sense they went from the bus
40:21 immediately to your system right yes
40:25 uhhuh okay so you don't need to wait
40:27 till till the shift of bus is over to
40:31 actually I don't know connect to the bus
40:33 and download the
40:36 data yes that's
40:40 cool and then it's like Kafka p park all
40:43 the usual tools that we use in data
40:45 engineering right yes mhm and you work
40:51 there with this
40:53 infrastructure yes yes did you ever need
40:56 to go like on a bus to fix a sensor no I
41:01 haven't had the had the need
41:04 to like it's uh pretty reliable right
41:08 yes generally it's reliable but um I
41:12 think in data engineering there's also
41:13 the aspect of being able to to detect
41:16 data quality issues and or like detect
41:20 data normales so I think that's another
41:23 another aspect of data engineering
41:24 whereby we want to be able to know if
41:27 certain transporter on a transmitter on
41:29 a bus is not sending data
41:32 correctly yeah so I haven't had to go
41:35 down to a bus specifically but I think
41:37 that is one aspect whereby we are always
41:40 as data Engineers you always have to
41:42 enhance in order to ensure that data
41:43 quality is is
41:48 there the yeah I'm just
41:52 thinking what else to ask cuz like I'm
41:55 kind of torn apart between uh like going
41:58 down to the like traditional data
42:00 engineering but I'm also interested in
42:02 the Gen
42:04 applications um so what do you want to
42:07 maybe go deeper
42:10 into we could go more into how AI yeah
42:14 into more into the AI aspect of things
42:18 yeah so do you have any other
42:19 applications apart from that
42:22 uh question to SQL uh think
42:28 um that is the the main thing that I'm
42:30 currently working on but I think
42:33 increasingly there
42:35 are there are generative AI applications
42:38 that can be applied whether is it to to
42:41 help create synthe synthetic data for
42:45 because there are certain certain types
42:47 of projects
42:49 whereby we do not have the full scope of
42:52 data and generative AI can potentially
42:54 be applied to to create synthetic data
42:56 for these purposes um on top of that I
42:59 think increasingly we may be able to
43:03 think of generative AI as the new UI in
43:07 terms of how people search for things
43:09 how
43:10 people um look for information because
43:15 we may be
43:17 increasingly more accustomed to using a
43:19 chat in interface rather than going to a
43:23 website clicking on multiple tabs to
43:25 find the information you need MH and
43:28 moving away from keyword search into
43:30 more into semantic search so I think
43:32 there are a lot of applications for for
43:36 generative AI whether is it in the
43:38 e-commerce space or or elsewhere it
43:40 could shape the way we search for search
43:42 for things to buy in the future we may
43:45 not need to key in keywords we could use
43:47 a chat interface to to discuss and get
43:50 ideas on what to buy for like maybe my
43:53 nissa's birthday next month yeah I'm
43:56 getting so lazy these days with like the
43:59 chbt and the like CU
44:02 um I can just use voice recognition so I
44:06 take my phone I start speaking then I
44:08 click the button and then it starts
44:11 answering my question like I don't even
44:13 need to type it's so
44:14 convenient um I'm curious about the
44:17 synthetic data that you mentioned uh
44:21 like my experience with uh llms when it
44:25 comes to synthetic data like I didn't
44:27 experiment a lot so I'm wondering how
44:30 actually good it is when it comes
44:33 to to generating data like I don't know
44:37 numerical data like can it do time
44:38 series or what kind of data you
44:42 need um I think I I I talked about this
44:46 in quite a a general sense but I just
44:49 thought of geni in being able to create
44:54 synthetic data especially when it comes
44:56 to to to more complex on new data sets
45:00 um and also from a data sharing
45:04 perspective sometimes there are there's
45:06 a need to to either mask
45:09 information and gen AI might be one
45:14 potential way to share the information
45:17 but generate it in a sense that it is
45:20 the the the sensitive or confidential
45:23 information is being masked mhm cuz you
45:27 release the city of Singapore releases a
45:30 lot of public data to like this open
45:33 data platforms right and sometimes you
45:36 need to edit this data before
45:40 publishing um the current data that we
45:43 share are data that is collected from
45:46 systems of course we Mass things like
45:50 um U cut numbers
45:55 MH what they actually share like and how
45:58 to to find this
45:59 information um there are two key
46:01 platforms one is data.gov Dog the other
46:05 one is called Data Mo so data.gov
46:08 Aggregates um information across
46:11 different government bodies in Singapore
46:13 and it ranges from things like rainfall
46:16 to air pollution
46:20 figures so there are categories like art
46:22 and culture education economy
46:24 environment geospatial housing Health
46:26 social trans
46:27 real time API so I guess I need to go to
46:30 transport to see your data sets right
46:34 yeah okay so I go to
46:37 transport and there is quite a lot of
46:40 things yes
46:42 like air travel geospatial data of like
46:47 Puffs
46:49 Network and um let's say somebody also
46:54 in January will start the next of data
46:57 engineering what kind of projects would
46:59 you recommend for them to try using
47:02 these data
47:04 sets I think one useful data set could
47:07 be car parking data because we collect
47:11 um car parking figures in I think I
47:14 think if I'm not wrong it's real time so
47:16 you get Gentry um transactions so I
47:20 think transaction data is quite a useful
47:22 and large data set for data engineering
47:25 projects whereby you can inest the data
47:27 in real time store it store it in a data
47:30 warehouse data Lake and then process it
47:32 later on for
47:35 analysis car
47:40 parking how do I find it so I just uh
47:44 look for car parking I don't think I can
47:46 find anything I think car parking is a
47:49 dynamic data
47:51 set H there there's a real time apis
47:55 maybe this is what I yes I'm interested
47:57 in okay
48:00 yeah and I guess I would be interested
48:03 in uh I cannot find maybe you can send
48:06 it later this is not something I can
48:07 just find right now yeah I can send to
48:09 you later another one would be real time
48:12 taxi data also another Dynamic data set
48:15 because I think the last data
48:16 engineering Zoom cam we were using the
48:19 the New York Taxi data set keep using it
48:22 it is an aggregated data set but I think
48:26 would be useful to also look at real
48:29 time data set and like go through the
48:30 process on on how to to store this
48:34 information so I put taxi there in the
48:37 search bar and then I see public
48:40 transport capacity monthly taxi
48:42 population and there's data from January
48:45 2005 to December uh this is not uh super
48:49 up to date but like it's up to December
48:51 2017 so there is quite a lot of data but
48:56 I see like there are many data sets with
48:59 that are constantly updated right ah you
49:02 sent me something yeah I just sent it to
49:04 you there's another there's another link
49:06 specifically for transportation so the
49:08 under the dynamic data sets you would
49:10 find real time cup
49:12 availability or things like like parking
49:16 yeah what I'm doing right now is I'll
49:19 I'm putting this to
49:21 our uh to the description so you can
49:25 check the description right now I put
49:27 the link yeah thank
49:29 you um yeah I don't see actually any
49:33 questions
49:35 from
49:37 anyone so I let me
49:41 check so yeah I I run out of questions I
49:44 don't see any questions from um anywhere
49:47 uh I'm just
49:49 wondering uh I have a few last ones so
49:53 if somebody wants
49:55 to study what you do are there any books
49:59 or courses that you would recommend on
50:02 [Music]
50:03 um on this uh on uh
50:07 Transportation uh
50:10 geographical um uh transport on learning
50:13 more about transport scientists what
50:15 kind of work they do um things like that
50:19 like other courses or
50:22 books um I think the causes by data talk
50:26 cam as a good um primer but also going
50:30 more into specifically into we use tax
50:34 yes so I think that is one very rare
50:38 example on how to work with
50:40 data and how to apply it in a rail
50:44 context so I think those are good use
50:46 cases um but also understanding more
50:50 about the the why behind why we do this
50:54 kind of analysis I think there are two
50:56 books that kind of shape the way I I
50:59 think about cities one is the death and
51:01 life of Great American cities by Jane
51:03 Jacobs so this is a very classic book
51:06 that provides a Critic of urban planning
51:08 and as well as her vision on creating
51:11 how to create vibrant and lievable
51:12 cities through communitybased approaches
51:16 and also paying attention to human skill
51:19 design um another book is about is is
51:22 titled happy cities Transforming Our
51:24 Lives through Urban Design so this book
51:27 Blends urban planning with psychology
51:29 and sociology and it explores how cities
51:31 can be designed to improve our happiness
51:33 and well-being and I think this provides
51:35 a very good backdrop into why we even
51:38 bother to study taxi movement in the
51:41 city yeah interesting so the first one
51:43 is death and life of American cities and
51:47 the other one is Happy cities right yes
51:50 okay interesting well I remember being
51:54 in the States and it's very difficult to
51:56 get around without a car well apart from
51:59 New York and Boston maybe yeah so yeah I
52:03 hope they Implement some of things we do
52:07 in Europe or in
52:08 Singapore so then it's uh was I I
52:11 remember actually I was picked up by by
52:13 a police car when I was uh going there
52:16 so I was just walking I since I'm from
52:19 Europe I'm not used to you know having
52:22 to have a car to get around so I was
52:24 just walking and it was a Road without
52:27 any guidelines for pedestrians so I was
52:31 just walking down the road and then the
52:33 police will stop me saying hey what are
52:35 you doing here why are you walking why
52:37 are not in the
52:39 car that's funny yeah well anyways uh
