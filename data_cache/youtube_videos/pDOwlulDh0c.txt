0:35 we and you prepared for this interview
0:39 so if you're ready we can start yeah I'm
0:42 ready
0:44 this week we'll talk about data science
0:46 in healthcare and we have a special

1:03 welcome
1:05 thank you also thank you for the
1:07 invitation to the podcast
1:10 um I have been following some previous
1:12 podcasts that you did some other talks
1:14 but I'm also glad to meet you like that
1:17 in live
1:19 but I'm familiar like with this setting
1:23 and also seeing you but not
1:27 yeah big thanks to Adonis who
1:30 recommended Elena and uh it's not the
1:32 first guest here but recommend so thanks
1:34 Adonis a lot and also the questions for
1:37 today's interview are prepared by
1:39 Johanna Byer thanks a lot yahana for
1:41 your help
1:43 and yeah let's start
1:45 um before we go into our main topic of
1:48 data science health and Healthcare let's
1:50 start with your background can you tell
1:52 us about your career Journey so far
1:55 so as I said I am Greek so I was born
1:59 and raised there I went to University
2:01 there in the University of patras I did
2:05 electrical and computer engineering
2:07 which is a five-year Bachelor and
2:11 Masters to join degree
2:14 and during that studies
2:18 Erasmus and I did part of my thesis in
2:20 Brussels
2:22 and I stayed there for one year it was
2:25 my first International experience and
2:27 then I got excited
2:29 uh it was way Uber University
2:33 so it was the Dutch um that speaking
2:37 free University I studied in the French
2:40 one
2:41 um
2:42 yeah exactly I also did some courses
2:46 there because I I needed also to pick up
2:50 some courses so I did also a bit of fuel
2:52 but uh but mainly it was very Uber
2:56 and then after that I was excited about
3:00 going abroad and I applied for an
3:02 internship at Philips Healthcare in the
3:05 Netherlands so I moved to the
3:07 Netherlands
3:09 and actually now the last seven years
3:11 I'm here
3:13 and I have been doing different things
3:16 the main focus is always Healthcare
3:20 um
3:21 and I also worked there at Phillips
3:25 Healthcare after some point and then I
3:28 did the two-year engineering doctorate
3:30 diploma in data science that's the only
3:34 thing that was not related to healthcare
3:36 because we were involved in multiple
3:38 projects and we worked with different
3:40 companies and organizations but then
3:43 after that degree I got back again to
3:45 healthcare and I worked for the startup
3:48 working on developing monitoring systems
3:51 for vital signs for Pediatric patients
3:55 in Africa
3:56 so that's in short my journey but if you
3:59 have questions you can ask me we can go
4:01 more in detail
4:03 how's your Dutch
4:05 it's good at this Hood
4:09 and so around B1 level let's say okay
4:13 yeah yeah that's because like in the
4:16 Netherlands everyone speaks English so I
4:17 guess it's very difficult to actually
4:19 learn and practice
4:22 it's true but I find it interesting and
4:25 also sometimes useful because some
4:28 things are just written in Dutch or
4:30 sometimes I need to search something in
4:32 that like I can find better results so
4:35 that's why I'm a bit also stick and I
4:38 have also personal interest to learn
4:41 so nice
4:43 so um well I have never heard about
4:46 Philips Healthcare so what I know about
4:48 Philips is they produce lamps
4:51 I have a few smart lamps this Philips
4:54 Hue then I'll I also know they produce
4:58 trimmers like for shaving but also you
5:01 know
5:03 but that's pretty much the extent of
5:05 what you know what Philips I know it's
5:07 like a gigantic gigantic company uh
5:11 and I know that the headquarters is in
5:13 it is in Idaho and red
5:16 like what does actually Philips
5:18 Healthcare do
5:20 okay they don't do lamps anymore they
5:22 sold the company so now with the lamps
5:26 and like the smart lighting and all
5:28 those things it's called signify
5:30 and now if it's focusing on Like Home
5:33 Care uh like shaving machines and things
5:36 like that do brushes and also
5:40 um like healthcare but like broad care
5:43 of Health at home in the hospitals they
5:46 do like also they have MRI scans
5:50 and they have big machines as well so I
5:53 worked also like I did my internship in
5:57 the
5:58 city arm which is like a machine used in
6:02 the operation room and then I worked
6:06 when I was working at Phillips
6:07 Healthcare in the pregnancy Department
6:11 so they were like two different projects
6:14 focusing on different areas of
6:15 healthcare
6:17 yeah it's a huge company
6:20 so what I understood is mostly about
6:22 different devices that people use like
6:25 doctors use for different things like be
6:29 it MRI scans or support in decoration
6:33 room or things like that yeah
6:36 foreign
6:38 and at your current company
6:41 um
6:42 what do you do you mentioned uh is it
6:44 it's helping people in Africa maybe you
6:47 can tell us more so actually I left my
6:50 current company in July so I'm actually
6:53 now in sabbatical but
6:56 I worked for them for almost two years
7:00 and there I was focusing more on
7:04 designing uh like what is the future of
7:07 data science in the company and how we
7:10 can develop a data science into the
7:13 Vital sign monitoring system we were
7:16 working on
7:18 and that was actually
7:21 a system that was recording Vital Signs
7:25 like heart rate respiration rate espe2
7:28 of pediatric patients devices like these
7:32 variables or something like more precise
7:34 so it was actually a system for the
7:38 Intensive Care Unit
7:40 but then the difference was that we were
7:43 working on a design for low resource
7:45 settings and a mod also simplified
7:48 design because
7:50 sometimes like healthcare professionals
7:53 there
7:55 uh they might like find it more
7:57 convenient if they like the device is
7:59 simpler for them
8:01 because actually a lot of hospitals we
8:04 were working with Malawi and a lot of
8:06 hospitals there they don't have
8:09 um monitoring systems
8:14 yeah and I was actually mainly working
8:16 on the design on like because we were
8:20 involved in a data collection process we
8:23 were collecting data and there was this
8:25 big question what we are going to do
8:27 with this data and how we can use it to
8:32 yeah to predict vital signs for patients
8:34 to associate lab tests from lab tests we
8:39 were getting uh to identify specific
8:42 clinical outcomes
8:44 so things like that but a one of my
8:47 learnings there it's like that it's a
8:49 very long process from like starting
8:52 from the research part that was mainly
8:54 focusing on into reading integrating
8:57 those algorithms into the real setting
9:00 and making it like
9:01 usable for people
9:05 so as I understood the devices are
9:07 already there like all the things that
9:10 collect data from patients like all
9:12 these vitals is already there and what
9:15 you were doing is
9:16 thinking like okay we have all this data
9:19 how we can use it but the devices were
9:22 also were there because
9:25 um we were part of a bigger research
9:28 project so they were installed there for
9:31 the purpose of the reset
9:33 okay
9:35 yeah that's quite interesting and you
9:37 spent there like a couple of years right
9:41 yeah
9:42 okay so I see so you started in Philips
9:45 Healthcare and then you worked in this
9:47 company
9:49 um what did why did you decide to go
9:52 into Healthcare
9:54 why did you decide to choose this area
9:57 so
10:00 before choosing and going into
10:02 engineering I had this big question
10:03 whether to go into studying or doctor or
10:08 engineering then I went for engineering
10:11 because I was in two months
10:14 and then when the time came to decide on
10:18 what kind of thesis I want to do
10:20 the only topic that I was Finding most
10:24 interesting was topics related to
10:25 healthcare because there I was finding
10:28 that there is more
10:30 impact directly on people
10:34 um I still remember for example that
10:37 there were some projects on developing
10:39 games and I was finding those like for
10:42 me personally not impactful and then I
10:46 choose for that
10:48 and indeed it was true that I was like
10:52 feeling that my work goes somewhere that
10:55 can impact people's lives
10:59 but here what was your thesis topic
11:03 so I worked together with iMac I'm not
11:07 sure it's a Belgian Research Institute
11:10 and there we were working I had images
11:14 from white blood cells
11:17 and I was analyzing those images with
11:21 like basic
11:24 um conventional image processing methods
11:26 and then the main goal was to classify
11:30 those images into subcategories of white
11:32 blood cells
11:34 and that was actually part of a bigger
11:37 project
11:38 uh because they were working on the
11:41 development of a cell short they were
11:44 calling machine which was actually a
11:46 machine that they wanted to
11:50 filter the blood of people and to
11:54 classify the blood cells into
11:59 like wood cells and cancerous cells and
12:03 they wanted to filter out the cancer of
12:04 cells
12:06 and then I was just working on a small
12:08 part of this project on the white blood
12:10 cells
12:12 yeah I was going to ask like why exactly
12:14 do you need to
12:16 categorize but you answered that because
12:19 like if the cell is uh
12:21 has cancer right then you don't want
12:24 itself yes and the main like they wanted
12:26 to prevent metastasis of cancer into
12:29 like another tissue
12:32 yeah that does sound very impactful and
12:35 for you as a student was like working I
12:38 think like that
12:39 yeah I can see why it was very
12:42 interesting and like you worked on this
12:45 master thesis and then the company
12:48 you did some models right and then
12:52 the company
12:55 integrated this right in there
12:57 sorting mechanism
13:00 yeah that's pretty cool
13:02 so you really like this topic and then
13:05 you started researching okay what where
13:08 can I go next and then I found Philips
13:11 Healthcare right
13:12 yeah and there I worked
13:17 um on a topic that it was not really
13:19 related to data science
13:22 but
13:24 they have this uh CRM which is like on
13:28 the shape of seats like that and on the
13:30 top of this arm there are four cameras
13:33 and here it's like the bed of the
13:36 patient and those four cameras take like
13:40 a different perspective of the patient
13:42 and they have also different angle and
13:45 like my task there was to take those
13:49 four Images calculate the geometry and
13:52 create the 3D object the representation
13:54 of the patient
13:57 well it still sounds very mathematical
13:59 heavy right yes
14:03 but it's not like machine learning those
14:05 things but it was yes
14:08 do you know if this problem is being
14:11 solved these days with machine learning
14:13 with neural Nets
14:17 I'm not aware about this because I saw
14:19 like it's not related to healthcare at
14:21 all I saw some demos where people were
14:26 going around Berlin or other different
14:28 cities taking pictures
14:29 and then there is a model or something
14:33 that just takes all these images and
14:35 creates like a 3D model of these things
14:38 and it
14:41 looked really impressive like what they
14:44 could do with just a few images
14:46 I'm sure that probably machine learning
14:48 can help on like the challenges of these
14:50 computational methods
14:53 because for example sometimes we had
14:56 occlusions
14:58 which means that
15:00 um
15:01 when there was no object between the
15:04 cameras it was easy to reconstruct a 3D
15:06 object but when we had like a surgical
15:09 object
15:10 it was harder to like create the shape
15:14 of the 3D mode
15:16 so this computational method was not
15:18 really
15:19 yes tackling this challenge or probably
15:22 mache learning can create a better like
15:24 graphical mode
15:25 mm-hmm
15:27 okay but it was still quite mathematical
15:30 heavy and then eventually you after
15:32 working on this 3D reconstruction you
15:36 probably continued working in this data
15:39 science areas right
15:41 also Phillips I worked as a data analyst
15:44 after
15:45 uh on a project that was a research
15:49 project
15:50 again economy work in research all those
15:53 years and we were actually collecting
15:57 data from brandian women
15:59 and that project was directed
16:04 um
16:05 like the users were midwives
16:08 that they wanted to see how the pregnant
16:10 woman are doing at home so it was home
16:13 care
16:14 and the pregnant woman were awaiting
16:17 themselves every day they were waiting a
16:19 smart watch that was calculating their
16:21 heart rate
16:24 um and actually this was important
16:26 information for the midwives because
16:28 also it's very important during the
16:30 pregnancy
16:31 how many weight the pregnant woman are
16:35 gaining because it needs to be within
16:37 some limits
16:39 and I was working
16:41 as a data analyst there on developing a
16:45 dashboard visualizing in a user-friendly
16:47 way this information for the midwives
16:50 but we were actually co-creating this
16:52 because we were getting a lot of
16:53 feedback from them
16:55 on what is like useful for them to see
16:58 and what is like not so that was quite
17:02 interesting because
17:04 um it was also like I really liked that
17:07 I was getting the feedback from them and
17:09 then we were creating it together
17:14 oh I'm trying to look at what we
17:17 discussed so far yes and like you worked
17:23 well first like your thesis was about
17:26 the cell classification for cells or
17:29 term
17:30 then you worked at this with this 3D
17:33 reconstruction then
17:36 um the thing you just described so it
17:39 was more like not for an operational
17:41 room not for like a hospital but
17:42 something you wear at home for pregnant
17:44 pregnant women
17:46 like is there like these areas they look
17:50 quite different from
17:51 one uh from from each other right so
17:54 they're they're different so I'm
17:56 wondering if there is any area of
17:58 healthcare that you're more interested
18:00 in or they're all equally interesting
18:02 for you
18:04 um now you said they're quite different
18:06 with each other and also like if you
18:08 consider the projects I worked later on
18:10 there are also quite different
18:14 uh but they have a common thing that
18:19 the approach or the things that you are
18:21 looking at
18:23 when you are working with a healthcare
18:25 data
18:27 uh but personally what I find
18:30 interesting is to work on the research
18:32 side of healthcare
18:34 because I like the novelty of create and
18:37 also creating new ideas and
18:41 another common thing is that I find
18:45 interesting to work on projects that
18:48 they also have the potential of a
18:51 clinical application or that they're
18:53 already like tested in a real setting
19:00 so there is no specific area you more
19:02 focus on like can I make impact now
19:04 can I publish a paper or will the thing
19:08 I work on will go and affect lives now
19:11 after I finish
19:12 yeah okay it must be really cool to see
19:15 things you work on in action right
19:17 yes that that is quite rewarding
19:22 I think you've published a few papers
19:23 research papers right
19:25 what were these papers
19:28 so during
19:32 the period that I was working for this
19:35 company that we were working for like
19:38 Vital sign monitoring systems in Africa
19:42 um
19:43 I was working on
19:48 and it's called ballistography signal
19:51 data
19:52 so it's actually
19:58 a novel uh signal I'm thinking on how to
20:02 explain that easier for people and it's
20:05 actually this signal and this
20:07 application wants to replace the
20:11 electrocardiography signal
20:13 uh
20:14 and like in simple terms now if a
20:18 patient is in the Intensive Care Unit
20:20 they just put them electrodes on the
20:24 patient and they need to like have the
20:26 electrodes there for many hours and it
20:29 can be tiring for the patient and the
20:31 patient cannot move around
20:33 while this sensor was actually in
20:38 a mat that was going uh below the like
20:41 actual mat of the patient's bed and was
20:44 recording the signal of the movement
20:47 including like the movement that comes
20:50 from the respiration rate and the heart
20:52 rate
20:53 so I was actually working on that I was
20:56 using uh the ballistography signal and
21:00 the electrocardiography signal uh as a
21:03 reference
21:04 and then I was trying to remove the
21:07 noise from the ballistography signal and
21:10 extract the vitals from there
21:13 so that was the novel application
21:16 so if I understood correctly so in this
21:19 method so there there is one
21:22 more like not intrusive but Annoying not
21:25 convenient method when the patient is
21:27 covered with all this uh electrodes
21:30 right it's not convenient and then there
21:32 is less annoying method which is like
21:34 just placing some things under the mat
21:36 where the patient is right and what you
21:40 were doing is trying to
21:42 use machine learning to go from the
21:45 signal like more noisy signal to more
21:47 accurate signal
21:50 of the heart rate and respiration rate
21:53 for the respiration rate I used more
21:57 conventional signal processing up
21:59 approaches because it's simpler to
22:02 estimate the respiration rate which is
22:04 like much bigger signal what you get but
22:07 then for the heart rate it was much more
22:09 challenging and that's why we went into
22:11 deep learning and we also like I had I
22:14 have the approach that if we can use
22:16 like if we can solve a problem with
22:18 basic signal processing then it's much
22:20 better to do it like that and if we need
22:23 to use something like more advanced then
22:26 we can go to deep learning machine
22:28 learning techniques
22:30 what is basic signal processing it's
22:32 like these Fourier methods so filters
22:36 Fourier methods yes
22:40 I focusing on the frequencies of the
22:44 respiration rate that we were interested
22:46 in either there of course there were
22:48 some challenges because we had to do
22:50 with pediatric patients which means
22:53 weaker signals like class movement
22:57 and we also had the challenge that
23:00 sometimes the frequencies of the
23:01 respiration rate and the heart rate kind
23:03 of overlap
23:06 and then it's like hard to know what is
23:09 what
23:10 but yeah it's a it's it's a very
23:13 interesting research I think
23:15 I see that you shared a link to one of
23:19 your Publications which is a unit deep
23:22 learning model for infant heart rate
23:25 estimation from ballistography right
23:29 that's the paper you're talking about
23:31 yeah
23:32 and this is a the paper where we were
23:34 estimating the heart rate
23:36 uh we use this unit which is actually
23:40 used for object segmentation
23:43 but you will use it for the object
23:46 augmentation in images but in this case
23:48 we use it for the signal because there
23:51 is um in the ballistography signal there
23:53 is a very distinct
23:55 pattern of the heart rate and actually
23:58 our Focus was to identify this District
24:02 pattern on the signal
24:05 yeah quite interesting so I'm just
24:08 looking at the paper well not at the
24:10 actual paper is more like at this
24:12 research gate website we will definitely
24:14 put the link in the description so you
24:16 can check it out
24:19 um
24:20 yeah a lot of words I don't understand
24:22 like BSG waveform
24:25 probably that's quite an understanding
24:27 edit okay thanks
24:31 um and I I think like when you uh
24:35 probably you wanted to talk about some
24:37 other papers right or some other
24:38 research before we open the next one uh
24:43 this is like my my first publication
24:47 um
24:48 I also um like uh I published a poster
24:53 that it's not like available online
24:56 [Music]
24:57 um
24:58 but it was about uh calculating a
25:02 patient's coding based on the vitals of
25:05 the patients
25:06 and the main idea behind this was to
25:10 have like a novel assessment of the
25:12 health status of the patient so that
25:14 like healthcare professionals can have
25:16 an idea of like how critical is this
25:19 patient
25:20 yeah
25:23 and I I already see quite a few
25:26 questions and this is actually one of
25:27 the questions uh we also have
25:30 is about the challenges of working
25:34 um
25:35 in healthcare because it's a quite
25:37 regulated
25:39 um area right and like I guess there are
25:44 a lot of privacy concerns and things
25:46 like that so what are the typical
25:48 challenges of working there
25:51 hmm
25:53 yes one it's like a
25:56 getting regulatory approval for
25:58 including algorithms and machine
26:01 learning algorithms in the devices and
26:04 the reason behind that is that it's like
26:06 a black box so of course it's sometimes
26:11 hard to like understand why a machine
26:15 learning model predicts a specific
26:17 outcome
26:19 [Music]
26:20 um
26:21 yeah and they're there a lot of work
26:24 needs to be done in the like explainable
26:26 AI product on like
26:29 um how we can give an explanation on why
26:33 the algorithm predicts the specific
26:35 outcome which like this field of AI is
26:38 still in a very early stage so I think
26:41 the more this field will be developed
26:43 also the more trust would be like um
26:46 from the side of the healthcare
26:47 professionals but also from the people
26:49 that approve
26:52 such as devices to be used in hospitals
26:59 yeah one this is it another is the
27:04 a lack of data sometimes or lack of
27:07 consistent data that
27:11 in real data sets we see a lot of times
27:13 that there are many data gaps so this
27:16 makes it hard for them algorithms to
27:19 take properly the inputs and sometimes
27:23 we need to make assumptions on what kind
27:26 of data we would expect to that patient
27:29 but then still this is also not always
27:32 the way to go so that's a problem and
27:36 another big problem is that many times
27:38 the data is being collected without
27:40 having in mind what kind of a use like
27:45 this organization wants to do with it so
27:48 for example one common problem is lack
27:51 of annotations
27:52 and then like for example they say we
27:55 want to do a predictive algorithm for a
27:57 specific clinical outcome but then the
28:01 proper data annotations for this outcome
28:03 are not there
28:06 what kind of outcomes is it like is a
28:09 patient going to have a stroke things
28:11 like that
28:12 yeah and like in my previous research I
28:16 was working on estimating sepsis let's
28:19 say based on the vital signs of the
28:22 patient and also their clinical data
28:26 I don't know if I want to Google what
28:27 sepsis
28:31 it's extremely sepsis is the body's
28:33 extreme response to an infection
28:36 it is a life-threatening medical
28:37 emergency so I guess you want to
28:41 um understand do you want to predict
28:43 that this thing is about to happen so
28:45 you want to act as fast as possible
28:48 right because the fastest you act on
28:50 that the more like chances you have to
28:53 treat it
28:54 mm-hmm
28:56 so I'd say guess why this explainable AI
28:59 is very important because like if the
29:02 algorithm predicts hey this patient is
29:04 going to have substance right and then
29:06 doctor looks at the patient thinks like
29:08 okay like they look normal right so then
29:11 they need to understand why exactly the
29:14 algorithm this model thinks that there's
29:16 a problem right and maybe if the doctor
29:19 understands then yeah okay yeah now make
29:22 sense let's make a few checks right and
29:25 what I think about this topic is that
29:27 the approach that should be taken like
29:31 um for the algorithms needs to be like
29:34 as a tool for the decision making and
29:37 the algorithms are not like now in a
29:39 level to do the decision making
29:41 and that's why we need to be careful
29:43 with that it's just a tool to help the
29:46 doctors and assess the situation
29:49 because also what they see people tend
29:52 to really go far ahead and we say we
29:55 want to predict what the patients we
29:56 have we want to give advice on what the
29:59 doctors should do but I think uh the
30:02 more data-driven approach needs to be
30:04 integrated slowly into the hospital
30:07 settings by just in the beginning giving
30:09 some recommendations or even say ah
30:12 maybe there's 60 chance that this
30:15 patient might have this kind of disease
30:17 so to make the doctors aware that this
30:20 is not a certainty they just need to
30:22 look more on that
30:24 so it's more like to get to gain trust
30:27 from from the doctors from the medical
30:29 personnel
30:30 Personnel that they see okay like this
30:34 model is actually making our life
30:36 simpler now we're trust it and then it
30:39 could be integrated in the workflow more
30:41 and more right
30:43 but also
30:45 um what I think is that sometimes even
30:47 just data visualizations of like uh with
30:51 historical data what happened to similar
30:53 patients in the past can be already
30:56 helpful without any prediction
30:58 so and then this is like more data
31:01 science and not machine learning just
31:03 like making doctors more aware of like
31:05 what happened in the past
31:09 and you talked about this regulatory
31:13 approvals and I imagine that these
31:17 things make it very difficult
31:20 to like let's say you work on a thesis
31:23 or like you work on a model and then now
31:25 it's time to actually what we call like
31:28 ship this model to production and this
31:30 process of
31:32 actually bringing this model an
31:34 algorithm from research to production
31:35 could be quite challenging right
31:38 so
31:39 I think it's there is also a question
31:41 from David it's like how difficult is to
31:44 come up with a solution that is actually
31:46 used in the field
31:47 like there are some political barriers
31:49 that might appear along the way like how
31:53 how how difficult and how do you usually
31:56 solve these problems
32:00 [Music]
32:01 what we were doing is that we were
32:03 getting a lot of feedback from the
32:04 healthcare professionals on what we need
32:07 I found the doctors from the nurses
32:09 because they were also like they're like
32:13 losing the Vital sign monitoring system
32:17 um but indeed the regulatory approval
32:20 part is a very big challenge
32:24 and there there are also other people
32:27 involved in the experts on that so
32:29 asking those people what's the way to go
32:32 it's like it can be helpful for bringing
32:36 those things into production
32:39 because many times we have the
32:41 application uh but yeah it stocks
32:46 and it cannot like it might take five
32:48 years to like be used in a hospital
32:55 so I guess in this case what you want is
32:58 uh doctors also actively advocating on
33:00 Urban Health saying that okay look like
33:03 this thing is really useful
33:05 uh we want to have it right and that's
33:07 so what he said
33:09 like you said you want to get feedback
33:11 from this Healthcare professionals
33:14 because like if the feedback is positive
33:16 they clearly see the value in this thing
33:18 then they help you right yeah and then
33:20 they trust it also more
33:23 because there is also lack of trust or
33:25 some sometimes
33:27 there is also this approach to people
33:29 that they don't want to try something
33:30 new they say ah now we work with ease
33:33 and they don't want to change
33:38 so you need to find doctors or
33:41 Healthcare professionals who are a
33:43 little more open-minded than others
33:46 right
33:48 could be difficult yeah
33:53 so yeah I see that there's a comment
33:56 from Sylvia thanks Eleni for sharing
33:59 your experience how advanced and trusted
34:02 is data science in healthcare compared
34:04 to other sectors because for example I
34:06 work in e-commerce and taking in
34:08 e-commerce people already know that okay
34:10 it's like
34:12 we have to have like a recommender
34:14 system like it's a default right so then
34:16 there is automatically distrusted we
34:18 know that machine learning and data
34:19 science will help e-commerce so let's
34:21 use it right so there are usually no
34:23 questions asked but in healthcare as you
34:26 said like people are not willing to try
34:28 new things then like it's not always
34:31 clear what exactly it brings and then
34:33 like there is also this
34:35 regular regulatory approvals might be
34:39 difficult so imagine that maybe there is
34:42 less
34:43 like data science there's less advanced
34:45 than in other areas is it correct
34:47 assumption it's true and there is also
34:50 something else uh like you said you work
34:52 in e-commerce and everything is digital
34:54 there so you can have a lot of data you
34:56 can track what customers are doing and
34:59 in the hospitals it's not like this
35:01 because sometimes you have data but you
35:04 don't have the timestamp of when this
35:06 happened or you have a timestamp that
35:08 might be wrong
35:09 and then you need to assume like that
35:12 this happened around this time so there
35:15 are a lot of things that happening
35:16 offline
35:17 which makes the data less like accurate
35:22 and like from there from the beginning
35:24 that's already a difficulty and of
35:28 course second thing is that the impact
35:31 of like a prediction it can be it's much
35:36 bigger than like maybe client gets um
35:38 like a wrong recommendation what's the
35:41 worst thing can happen
35:44 because like they would not just buy
35:46 things right and then they will continue
35:49 living their own life while here
35:52 actually like sometimes can be a matter
35:54 of uh living in time right
36:00 yeah how do you see this evolve like do
36:02 you think it will get more trust in the
36:05 future other successful use cases
36:08 stories
36:10 [Music]
36:11 there is a lot of research and
36:13 investment on that and I think
36:16 at that already it means that the
36:18 Alchemist will become better because
36:21 okay there is a reason also why there is
36:23 no trust it's not that this field is
36:25 really evolved and that always the
36:28 predictions are to be Trust
36:30 so but then because there is a lot of
36:33 research
36:35 and
36:36 also that means that um we have data
36:40 from different populations because
36:42 that's also a problem that maybe like uh
36:46 what I noticed also with my previous
36:47 working experience
36:49 is that we were collecting data from
36:51 Africa but there is not a lot of data
36:53 for Africa and we cannot use an
36:55 algorithm that we developed in Europe
36:57 with European patients for African
36:59 patients so I think uh like with time we
37:04 will have data from different
37:05 populations and then the algorithms will
37:08 become better
37:10 in that
37:11 uh yeah so I see there is a lot of
37:14 potential that's why I'm also motivated
37:16 to contribute on that
37:19 um
37:20 but I think this like even if AI or like
37:24 but now generative yeah it's really
37:27 advanced
37:29 AI is not really advanced in all the
37:31 fields in society and still there are
37:33 fields that they need a lot of
37:36 um work to be done
37:39 and one of the points you mentioned that
37:42 you can just easily take data collected
37:44 in Europe and use it for Africa which
37:46 makes sense but also a bit not exactly
37:50 intuitive at the first like when I first
37:53 think about this because on one hand
37:55 people with people everywhere right but
37:57 then like probably the living conditions
37:59 are different my climate is different
38:03 so so why can't we just take data from
38:06 Europe and use it for Africa what are
38:07 the reasons
38:08 like one thing is that in Africa there
38:11 are more malaria patients for example
38:13 than in Europe so what I want to say
38:17 with that they are also sometimes
38:18 different diseases in People based on
38:22 the location they live
38:24 and
38:25 that's why it's important to take those
38:28 things into account or also like in
38:31 different settings
38:32 maybe in Europe it's easier to collect
38:35 data from every single thing of the
38:37 patient but in Africa this is not
38:39 possible so you have limited data
38:41 collected and you need to take a
38:43 decision on that
38:45 mm-hmm
38:47 and I imagine that a person like an
38:50 average person who lives in their region
38:52 in Norway work they're probably very
38:56 different from an average person living
38:58 in uh
39:00 um
39:01 I don't know Nigeria
39:04 now they have different Lifestyles
39:06 different yeah
39:08 yeah interesting but uh still like his
39:11 data European data not useful at all
39:16 hmm we need to be careful when we do
39:20 kind of things
39:23 but it can be useful also maybe for a
39:27 having some conclusions for us but not
39:30 for developing really an algorithm to
39:33 applying lot resource settings
39:36 okay so you need to think okay like for
39:38 this specific I don't know feature or
39:40 data set like are there any problems
39:44 that might like is there something that
39:47 makes
39:48 I don't know the way the data was
39:50 collected in Europe different from the
39:52 data was collected in Africa like can we
39:54 actually use it right so for each
39:55 specific case you need to think right
40:00 and while we're talking about
40:03 um
40:05 integrating the solutions the algorithms
40:07 bringing them from research to
40:09 production
40:10 so there is some pushback from people
40:12 who don't want to try new things
40:15 and I remember like even in the in
40:18 e-commerce settings
40:19 so I was working with moderation teams
40:22 in the past
40:23 and there was some moderators they were
40:26 thinking okay like
40:28 so now this data scientists come and
40:31 they create machine learning models like
40:34 this AI will automate our jobs and we
40:36 will become redundant so let's not help
40:39 them right well I'm not saying that
40:42 people were explicitly saying that there
40:44 but like I sensed the sentiment and for
40:47 me as a data scientist my job was to
40:49 also educate them say hey we are not
40:51 going to make you redundant we are not
40:53 going to fire you we actually want to
40:55 help you be more effective
40:57 and I wonder like is there something
41:01 similar that is in healthcare like is
41:03 there
41:04 maybe this lack of trust
41:07 coming from these Healthcare
41:08 professionals is because they think okay
41:11 now my job will be automated but there
41:14 will be the sensors that monitor the
41:16 patient's condition and why am I needed
41:19 there like I'm not needed anymore so I
41:21 will not try to help you because like
41:23 why will I help you make myself
41:25 redundant
41:27 I have I have not seen it because
41:32 they still have a lot
41:34 of impact in the decision you're making
41:36 and those algorithms are not too far
41:38 ahead
41:40 so for now I think maybe they don't feel
41:44 that their job is at risk
41:47 maybe in the further further future but
41:50 uh for now I have not seen something
41:52 like that but what I personally believe
41:54 is that like by the years that I will
41:58 become more developed and this is an
42:01 actual risk because it already happens
42:03 for example with some jobs like like now
42:07 in the Netherlands in many supermarkets
42:09 they had like the uh automatic cashier
42:13 machine and before people were working
42:15 there and now just one person observes
42:18 if everything goes all right so and this
42:22 is a like a simple automation but then
42:26 yes in the future also more complex
42:29 decision-making processes can replace
42:32 humans
42:33 but okay I know like the viewpoints on
42:36 this topic are
42:39 controversial sometimes
42:42 I mean maybe the cashiers who worked
42:46 and were replaced by the machines now
42:48 they can do something else in the same
42:50 store so they don't need to do this
42:52 monotonous work
42:54 every day maybe it's actually a good
42:56 thing but we don't know what happened
42:57 with licorice right
43:04 let's see I'm also curious how this
43:06 thing is going to be developed
43:10 yeah I see that there is a comment about
43:12 India that in smaller cities data
43:16 is not created properly especially in
43:18 healthcare and yeah even in Germany like
43:22 it's such a mess to be honest like
43:25 Germany is a pretty Advanced country but
43:28 when it comes to healthcare like it's so
43:31 decentralized like all the like
43:33 different uh doctor offices like have
43:37 their own methods of collecting data and
43:39 yeah it's it's quite messy this is
43:45 um yes this is true
43:47 but I think there is a lot of work that
43:50 is being done on organizing like the
43:52 systems and also I think the healthcare
43:54 system in the Netherlands when I came to
43:58 the Netherlands it was much less
43:59 organized and now they have like a
44:03 patient files and they can just send
44:07 your electronic file to another hospital
44:09 and
44:12 when I initially came those things were
44:15 less
44:16 automatic and less connected so
44:21 yes there are people that they are
44:23 working on standardizing likely systems
44:25 that the data is going like also to be
44:28 saved because that's also another thing
44:30 that sometimes data is not properly
44:32 saved in secured places
44:36 but yeah
44:38 yeah I think in general the Netherlands
44:40 is pretty uh is a pretty Advanced
44:43 country in many aspects not just
44:46 Healthcare and the way data is collected
44:48 because like in Germany people still
44:50 send faxes like I don't know I recently
44:54 didn't Mr I explanation and all I got
44:58 was a compact disc I don't know like I
45:01 don't even have like places where I can
45:03 put a compact disc anymore
45:05 yeah so yes well at least it wasn't like
45:08 a discount or whatever
45:10 could be a biscuit right too thank you
45:14 and maybe I also see big differences
45:16 because I see that Healthcare in Greece
45:18 for example is also like different than
45:22 in the Netherlands they don't have this
45:24 like digitalization that they have here
45:27 we also give compact discs sometimes
45:30 okay yeah well from what I heard about
45:34 the Netherlands like
45:36 it is doing a really amazing job when it
45:39 comes to all this digitization of things
45:43 yeah do you think that like coming back
45:47 to this last topic so I imagine that
45:51 most of these Healthcare problems like I
45:53 don't know self-classification and I
45:56 don't know like the thing you were
45:58 talking about predicting from like quick
46:00 signal predicting like always uh
46:03 um body vitals
46:06 um like I imagine that it's since we
46:08 know that machine learning is not always
46:09 accurate I imagine that in many cases
46:12 like it's not as 100 percent
46:16 accurate prediction so it can be like 80
46:18 70 like does it make it more difficult
46:21 like do we see do we have to like have
46:23 really accurate systems to use them or
46:26 like if it's already like 60 accurate
46:29 it's already good
46:31 um I think the case is that it's not
46:33 very accurate we need to give more
46:35 information to the people so that they
46:37 can take decisions like we can what I
46:39 said before say we have 60 percent
46:41 accuracy
46:43 so then the person knows that the
46:46 this is just an estimation and it's not
46:50 really what's the reality so they need
46:52 to check by themselves or they need to
46:54 like see that and say okay we will do
46:56 this extra lab test because of that so
46:59 at the end it's not a tool that says
47:03 what happens in reality but it's more
47:05 like a notification like oh maybe this
47:09 patient has this or even
47:12 if we want to make them
47:15 like to make systems that they don't say
47:18 ah this patient has this critical
47:19 outcome it can be that you say this
47:22 patient has a high risk factor which is
47:25 more genetic
47:26 so they are different things and
47:29 different ways you can phrase and you
47:31 can give estimations about the situation
47:33 of the patient and what I think is that
47:36 we need to build this this thing
47:40 gradually
47:41 so maybe first just give a description
47:44 of the date of the patient in a more
47:47 like in a better visualization because
47:50 data visualization is also a part of
47:52 this so that the healthcare professional
47:54 can understand the current status
47:57 then okay if you develop like a
47:59 mathematical model then you can say uh
48:02 there is this patient has a bit higher
48:04 risk just look at the space
48:07 and maybe like with time also those
48:10 algorithms as I said they will be
48:11 developed more and they will be more
48:14 accurate
48:16 Plus
48:17 I I think
48:19 for the algorithm to be developed and to
48:21 be more accurate we need feedback from
48:23 the healthcare professionals so if they
48:25 like there is a prediction then they can
48:28 say this was a good prediction this was
48:31 a bad prediction and religions
48:33 so that the algorithm can take this
48:35 feedback and improve
48:39 so it all comes back to topics already
48:41 two things already talked about like
48:43 getting feedback from Healthcare
48:45 professionals and then investing into
48:47 better data collection processes right
48:49 but more feedback on the prediction so
48:52 like have the prediction and then
48:54 respond on that but what I see this is a
48:58 kind of um
48:59 a cyclical process
49:03 so it's not that I have the algorithms
49:05 will be ready and they would be used
49:06 like in a linear way it's more about
49:09 secret clean and like making more and
49:13 more accurate predictions
49:14 but I think for me it's important to be
49:17 as much as possible transparent
49:20 and give information to the people
49:24 and don't make big claims about things
49:27 okay that's not like uh
49:30 yeah this patient definitely has
49:33 um
49:35 Texas right so instead like this is a
49:38 high risk patient please check them
49:40 right and then the doctor makes
49:42 explanation and says okay indeed this
49:45 was a high-risk case so then you get
49:47 this feedback and you try to incorporate
49:49 this feedback into
49:51 well collect this and add this to your
49:54 data right
49:56 yeah
49:57 and there is a question from Avinash
50:00 about data engineering and data science
50:04 which made me think like okay we talked
50:06 about the data science part but there is
50:09 also
50:10 like for example I'm again thinking
50:13 about the camera settings so like there
50:16 is a data scientist Who develops
50:18 the machine learning algorithm like a
50:20 model right and then there is typically
50:22 a machine learning engineer who takes
50:23 this model
50:24 and
50:26 takes care of all the engineering around
50:28 the model
50:30 is there something like that like how
50:33 does exactly
50:34 you go about deploying this thing
50:36 provided that all these bureaucratic
50:38 things are solved like I imagine that
50:41 it's not like you just take this speaker
50:42 file and put this on the device there is
50:45 a process and there is a lot of
50:46 engineering involved there too right
50:49 but then this is indeed it's like for
50:52 the data engineer to just take the model
50:54 that the data science scientists created
50:57 and then deploy that on the machine so
51:00 that it also works and aligns with the
51:02 rest of the software there
51:06 and also they're taking into account
51:10 uh the restrictions of that because for
51:14 example in the low research setting
51:16 sometimes uh you cannot for example have
51:19 the model on the cloud it's not a good
51:21 idea because there is no internet there
51:23 is not a lot of
51:25 um like always
51:27 connectivity so then you need to deploy
51:30 the model on the device itself
51:32 so
51:34 yes you need to take into account the
51:37 specific use case that you deploy the
51:39 model
51:41 um yeah for this unit that we talked
51:45 about uh wasn't on device or in the
51:48 cloud
51:50 so this unit it was more on the research
51:54 phase
51:55 um and
51:58 we wanted to validate it further so on
52:01 that phase is things don't go very fast
52:04 we need to keep yeah okay okay so it was
52:07 more about like okay we have this data
52:09 we applied the model the research looks
52:12 promising let's continue rather than
52:14 okay like we already deployed and and
52:17 it's working everywhere and the continue
52:19 information is also the validation of
52:21 this so
52:23 before deploying it uh validating with
52:26 new data
52:28 and checking whether it works or not and
52:31 like what's the accuracy of it so there
52:35 are many steps on it yeah and Regulatory
52:38 approval it's also a big one like it
52:41 takes more time
52:44 so you mentioned that you're having a
52:47 sabbatical at the moment
52:50 um are you working on some
52:52 personal projects that are related to
52:54 healthcare too
52:56 I'm working on some personal projects
52:58 and I'm also doing some traveling and
53:01 I'm having some plans also for the next
53:03 months
53:05 and I'm actually reflecting on like what
53:08 I'm going to do next and like taking a
53:12 break to like rejuvenate
53:15 yeah
53:16 is there something you can already tell
53:18 us about or we will need to wait till
53:20 the next interview
53:25 okay okay we will keep an eye on your
53:27 LinkedIn profile
53:31 if somebody wants to get into Healthcare
53:35 and like somebody as a data scientist
53:38 what's uh how would you recommend them
53:40 to to do that so let's say I'm a data
53:43 scientist I have this typical e-commerce
53:45 experience but I got so motivated after
53:47 listening to you right now and I think I
53:49 want to to do something
53:51 so how can I get started how can I start
53:54 using my skills for that
54:00 I think first it's like more getting
54:05 um
54:06 a general idea on like do you want to
54:08 focus on Research do you want to focus
54:10 and to apply for a company that they
54:12 already like uh have already people
54:15 working on the regulatory approval and
54:18 then you can already work on deploying
54:20 those models in actual devices that
54:23 they're being sold
54:24 and yeah it depends it starts from you
54:28 and what you want uh but from my
54:31 experience because I I had like the
54:34 technical background and I'm working in
54:36 a different Healthcare projects when I
54:38 started the project I I learn a lot of
54:41 clinical information so in the beginning
54:44 because also it's Healthcare field is
54:46 different I have a lot of unknown like
54:48 conditions or known words like also
54:50 sepsis for me as it was for you it was
54:53 unknown but then after a while
54:55 it becomes one word of my vocabulary so
54:59 it's like if you have the technical
55:01 knowledge then you get also the context
55:03 by like spending two months on the sad
55:07 thing
55:09 yeah
55:10 but uh so what you said it's about you
55:12 and what I want but is it enough for me
55:15 to just want to work in healthcare or I
55:18 also need to have to get some prior
55:20 knowledge to be able to do that so with
55:24 my typical data science data scientist
55:27 who has experience working at the at an
55:30 internet company
55:31 they have no idea what sepsis is as mean
55:34 like they can just apply start applying
55:37 because the skills they have are already
55:40 enough or there should be some
55:41 preparation
55:43 before that
55:46 I think the skills are already enough
55:49 and maybe they will get a more technical
55:51 job
55:52 in the beginning in a Healthcare company
55:54 and then they can
55:56 received more if they want that's what I
56:00 saw for example in Philips Healthcare
56:02 that people entering the company and
56:05 then they were finding their way
56:08 okay so the important thing is as you
56:11 said what you want right if you already
56:13 have the skills then you can just apply
56:15 and
56:15 learn along the way
56:18 yeah
56:20 in general so I imagine that there are
56:24 many
56:25 um
56:27 like it's not the easiest job to have
56:29 because of all the problems all the
56:31 difficulties we discussed
56:33 so does it
56:35 children like
56:37 what I what I what I tried to ask is
56:39 like is there a lack of people who want
56:41 to work in healthcare or there is
56:44 usually a lot of interest from
56:47 from candidates from like you know data
56:49 scientists
56:51 there's a lot of interest but they also
56:53 ask for a lot of people in general in
56:55 the field of data science so that's what
56:59 I have seen but okay it depends also on
57:01 the country but still
57:04 but like for example in the Netherlands
57:07 there are like plenty of options
57:12 but indeed plenty of data scientists as
57:15 well because what I have noticed with
57:17 many people they like they shift to that
57:21 domain
57:22 there is like a trend
57:25 yeah wow it's great that there is
57:28 funding
57:32 there are companies who can pay money
57:34 and then the data scientists who are
57:35 interested in working on this so they
57:38 can you know find each other and
57:40 actually you know make something work on
57:43 something meaningful while not
57:45 starving right while making enough money
57:47 to leave that's really good especially
57:49 in the healthcare domain there are still
57:51 a lot of fields that um they haven't
57:54 included a lot of data science yet they
57:57 use like statistics they use linear
57:59 regression models so yes and there is
58:03 already funding so they need a lot of
58:05 people
58:06 to work on that
58:09 and why I mentioned about starving
58:11 because I remember talking to somebody
58:15 and they said it was like a few years
58:18 ago that
58:20 sometimes these projects are not really
58:21 well funded so it's like really people
58:24 who who want to make the change
58:29 but they have to be like very
58:30 enthusiastic about this right so it's
58:34 compared to working in an internet
58:36 company
58:38 that sometimes you know pays less right
58:41 so people need to be really you know uh
58:45 you know willing to to do this work I
58:48 hope this has changed
58:50 I have not seen this but maybe it
58:53 depends also on the country
58:55 including different countries there are
58:57 different funds as well so the
58:59 Netherlands is pretty Advanced as we
59:01 discussed so hopefully it's not an issue
59:03 there okay it's all we have time for
59:06 today thanks a lot Elena for joining us
59:08 today for sharing your
59:10 experience with us it was really
59:13 interesting to listen to your studies
59:16 and to everything you said and thanks to
59:18 everyone else for joining us today
59:20 and listening in and asking questions
59:23 thanks as well for inviting me it's also
59:26 it's nice to talk to you likewise and
59:29 thanks again Adonis for introducing
59:32 Helena and me
59:34 so yeah well looking forward to seeing
59:38 what happens after your sabbatical so
59:40 I'll keep an eye good luck with
59:43 everything thank you
59:45 okay bye and have a great weekend
59:47 everyone
59:48 great week not weekend yeah
