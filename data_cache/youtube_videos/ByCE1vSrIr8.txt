0:00 Should I start or you want to start?
0:03 You start. It's your thing. I I always
0:05 start. Well,
0:08 okay. Thanks u everybody for joining us
0:11 today. So today the topic is a bit uh
0:14 different from what we usually have. But
0:16 I really wanted to talk about this thing
0:18 uh because um um data talks club is
0:22 online community, machine learning um
0:24 MLOps is an online community and we have
0:26 so many online communities and there are
0:29 not so many talks about that especially
0:31 like um especially in the space of
0:33 machine learning data science and uh I
0:37 always wanted to uh to get Demetrius on
0:40 uh on the podcast because a he had me on
0:44 on the Melops community and uh I wanted
0:47 to get him back and uh I wanted to talk
0:50 to somebody about uh about building
0:53 online communities and who else could be
0:55 a better fit for that than you do. So,
0:58 thanks a lot for joining us today and uh
1:01 yeah, it's my pleasure to be here. I
1:04 really appreciate you having me on. It's
1:07 very cool and nice of you because you
1:11 actually had something to say when I had
1:14 you on. I'm not sure if I'm going to
1:16 have much to say, but you may you're
1:19 very kind in making this around
1:21 communities. So maybe I have a few words
1:24 that I can share, few words of wisdom.
1:28 Yeah. So um let's start. Maybe uh before
1:32 we go in the topic um in the main topic
1:34 about online communities, maybe you can
1:36 tell us a bit uh about yourself. So, how
1:39 did you end up creating uh being the
1:42 mastermind behind uh this thriving big u
1:46 uh lovely uh online community that has
1:50 3,000 members right now? So, how did it
1:53 start for you?
1:54 So, it was all by chance and what
1:58 happened was is that I
2:00 was doing sales work for this company
2:03 called Dot Science. I think I tried to
2:04 sell to you even Alexa. Yes, you did. I
2:07 did try to sell to you, didn't I?
2:09 I didn't me didn't buy, but at least our
2:14 relationship went somewhere. So, I was
2:16 doing the heavy and hard leg work of
2:20 reaching out to people trying to get
2:22 them to look at our MLOps tool called
2:24 dots science. And I was having okay
2:29 success with it. And then COVID hit. And
2:34 when COVID hit, nobody wanted to take a
2:36 meeting with me. Like my job became
2:39 really really hard. And so our old CEO
2:44 had the brilliant idea because he comes
2:46 from the Docker space. He had the
2:49 brilliant idea of hey why don't we have
2:52 a community because a community needs to
2:55 form around MLOps. We saw we had been
2:58 calling it DevOps for ML for like I
3:03 don't know like six months but then
3:06 MLOps term started to be used more and
3:09 more and I know it's been debated who
3:12 created that term. Uh I know that data
3:16 robot has ownership of it. Someone
3:19 pointed that out to us in the community
3:20 that they actually like have a trademark
3:23 on that. But the thing that happened was
3:28 is that it was like, okay, well, you
3:31 know, for the time being, let me just
3:34 start interviewing people and we'll see
3:37 where that goes. And I had read enough
3:41 books on like marketing and I had
3:44 actually wanted to create a podcast at
3:46 my last job which was as a
3:51 I was in sales also but I was at this uh
3:55 password management company
3:58 and
4:00 I wanted to create a podcast there
4:02 because I felt like it would be a great
4:03 way to have an excuse to talk to people
4:07 that I usually get to talk to or that
4:09 wouldn't answer my phone calls or that
4:11 wouldn't talk to me like you.
4:14 Exactly.
4:15 Exactly that, huh? I did end up getting
4:18 to talk to you. It just wasn't about the
4:21 tool. It was about actually more
4:23 informative stuff. So, we could argue
4:25 that it was better in the end. And so, I
4:29 wanted to start a podcast. I just at the
4:32 last company I was at, they asked me
4:33 like, "So, do you have any anything of
4:38 you actually doing it?" Like, they
4:39 didn't trust that I was going to be any
4:41 good at it, which is a fair assessment
4:44 because I'm I'm not sure if I am any
4:46 good at it there. Um, so that never went
4:51 anywhere. It never got off the ground.
4:53 And
4:55 when we decided to do the podcast and
4:59 the meetup really it was meetup. It
5:01 started as a meetup and I was like well
5:03 we should just record it and make it
5:04 into a podcast. So we went from there
5:07 and we also started a forum in the
5:09 beginning not just the slack but nobody
5:12 was using the forum after the first like
5:15 two months and so we stopped with that
5:18 but it was a place to congregate and
5:24 and it was from the beginning meant to
5:27 be vendor agnostic which was interesting
5:30 to think about because my CEO was the
5:33 one who told us to do it. It wasn't
5:35 connected to the company that we were
5:37 working at, dots science, but it was it
5:41 in a way like, hey, you should do this.
5:45 It might help. So, we went and did it.
5:49 And then it was vendor agnostic and we
5:50 didn't have to worry about like selling
5:53 our product. In fact, we were very much
5:55 against that idea. And then like a month
5:59 later, the company went out of business.
6:01 So, I definitely didn't have to worry
6:02 about selling anything.
6:06 And and then I just kept interviewing
6:08 people because the company was out of
6:10 business, but I was enjoying
6:11 interviewing people. And I had scheduled
6:13 like the company went out of business in
6:15 May. And I had scheduled meetups every
6:19 week until mid June or July, I think.
6:24 And so that's what made me be like, wow,
6:26 there's actually there's something here.
6:28 People are enjoying this or at least
6:31 people are willing to talk to me. I
6:33 don't know if people were actually
6:35 enjoying it. Uh
6:36 oh, I did.
6:37 You enjoyed the process. I don't know if
6:39 people enjoyed what you said, but
6:43 then uh then it was Yeah, it was a good
6:47 time, man. So, I was learning a ton. And
6:49 you'll see that if you go back to the
6:51 first meetups that I hosted, I didn't
6:56 ever ask any follow-up questions. And
6:59 one of the first meetup guests, Charles,
7:03 he made fun of me for this because he
7:04 was like, you know, I'm not sure I want
7:08 you to tell me the answer, but whenever
7:10 you get the responses from people, you
7:13 kind of do this gazing off like you're
7:16 deep in contemplation
7:18 and then you ask the next question. And
7:20 I'm just wondering if you're deep in
7:22 contemplation about what that person
7:23 said, like it's so profound, or you have
7:26 no idea what they they just said and
7:29 you're trying to understand it. And
7:31 which was it?
7:32 I'm not going to tell. I'm never going
7:33 to give away,
7:36 but I I didn't know. Yeah, I didn't know
7:38 what people were talking about in the
7:39 beginning, and I didn't have any way to
7:42 like actually follow up. So, I was just
7:44 there like trying to hold on. And I had
7:49 prepared questions that I would ask
7:52 people and I prepared everything
7:54 beforehand and I would generally just go
7:57 through those questions
7:59 uh that I prepared and I wouldn't have
8:01 any back and forth and so by the time
8:05 you came on I was starting to feel more
8:07 comfortable and now I feel too
8:09 comfortable I think.
8:10 So now you can consult on the loops
8:12 right?
8:15 Exactly.
8:18 That's it. That's my next my next
8:20 business idea.
8:22 But you also were a an English teacher,
8:24 right? I think I read it in some of your
8:27 um LinkedIn post that you first
8:28 If you want to go if you want to go way
8:30 back for sure. Like so I started
8:34 I got out of the US as soon as I
8:36 graduated university because I wanted to
8:39 not be in the US and
8:43 I went to Spain.
8:45 uh which is kind of a long story on why
8:48 I settled on Bill Bao Spain and we can
8:51 say that in the next data talks club
8:54 chat we have but I ended up in Bill Bao
8:57 and
8:59 I was there the easiest way for me to
9:02 stay there was to teach English
9:04 and I also wanted to learn Spanish. I
9:07 graduated with a degree in Spanish and
9:09 Portuguese. And I had been in Brazil and
9:11 I knew quite a bit of Portuguese, but I
9:14 and I also knew Spanish, but I didn't
9:16 know enough to be like, "Hey, I have
9:18 this degree in it. I should be fluent."
9:20 And so I stayed there uh for a few years
9:23 teaching English and then met my wife
9:25 and had a daughter and then didn't leave
9:28 for a long time. And from there it was
9:33 it was really easy to teach English. It
9:35 was like this flywheel where you just go
9:37 and you do it and you teach English, but
9:39 it wasn't like fulfilling at all and I
9:41 felt like I wasn't learning much
9:43 obviously because I spoke English and I
9:46 was learning about how to be a teacher
9:48 in the beginning and learning how to
9:50 talk to people and you could argue that
9:52 that helped me with this kind of stuff
9:55 but after like eight years of it it gets
10:00 very monotonous. And so I was looking
10:02 for a way out
10:03 and a friend got a job in sales at that
10:07 password management company. And so then
10:09 I I went from there into sales which is
10:13 just shout out to all the sales people
10:16 there. It's hard work. I will say that.
10:19 And then I got out of sales which is
10:23 another one where it's like I got lucky.
10:26 I was able to get out of that. So, I got
10:28 lucky getting out of English teaching
10:30 because I didn't want to be a lifer. I
10:32 didn't want to be 40 and still be
10:34 talking about the past participle. And I
10:38 got out of sales, too.
10:40 Okay. I guess uh that uh the skills you
10:43 picked uh up when you were working in
10:46 sales, they're pretty helpful in uh how
10:49 to say closing speakers, right? like
10:52 finding first of all finding people who
10:55 to talk to then uh convincing them to
10:57 get on your podcast and then uh finally
11:00 actually you know getting them and
11:02 talking to them on the podcast.
11:04 Yeah, you've probably seen this too
11:07 within the ML space. It feels like it's
11:10 really easy to get people to come on. uh
11:14 I also had the
11:17 the community data on Kubernetes which I
11:20 think you wanted to talk about too and
11:24 in that space it was much harder to get
11:27 people
11:29 to come on and there I needed the sales
11:33 skills which is just basically being
11:35 persistent like if you're persistent
11:38 you're gonna get a no or a yes but
11:39 you're gonna get something and I don't
11:41 stop until I get something and So, some
11:45 people
11:46 will stop asking after 10 times, but
11:50 if you've done sales enough, then you
11:52 know, well, there's probably I probably
11:54 shouldn't stop asking until 20 times or
11:57 I get that no just like tell me no and
12:00 I'll go away on the first time. Uh, and
12:04 kind of, maybe not, but that yeah, there
12:08 were some definite skills that were
12:10 useful. they transferred over well. But
12:12 in MLOps, man, you don't need it. In ML
12:15 and MLOps in general, I don't think it's
12:17 necessarily needed because people are
12:20 willing to talk. Uh it's not so
12:23 saturated
12:25 with a million different podcasts and a
12:28 million different communities that you
12:31 you get the same response like when in
12:35 the Kubernetes land. I think in
12:37 Kubernetes it's different because there
12:40 are so many different companies that
12:42 have their own podcast and they have
12:43 their own community and they have all of
12:45 this. So when I would appre approach
12:47 people they would be like okay and ask a
12:52 bunch of questions like this was my
12:53 worst least favorite question was how
12:56 big is your audience?
12:59 Okay
13:01 and that's when I told him there's only
13:02 four people watching live on YouTube.
13:08 Okay. So maybe let's uh let's talk a bit
13:11 about uh the the community you built and
13:15 u I know now like I don't know how many
13:18 people per day join but every time I see
13:20 the the number of members like I think
13:23 it increases like 100 members per day.
13:25 So this is like an awesome growth but it
13:27 didn't start there right so at the at
13:30 the beginning you needed to get some
13:31 traction right so how how did it start
13:35 for you? So I understood so first you
13:37 started with events reaching out to
13:38 speakers uh trying to invite them but
13:42 how did you and I know that you were not
13:45 alone in that but uh you as a community
13:48 um how did you manage to get this
13:49 traction what did you need to do to to
13:52 do that
13:54 you're asking for my secrets Alexa so
13:57 you can replicate it
13:59 yeah exactly
14:01 actually one thing that we did which is
14:04 quite useful when you're starting a
14:06 community, if you're building a
14:07 community, one thing that I did, I would
14:11 say, is
14:14 I reached out to a bunch of random
14:17 people on
14:19 LinkedIn and LinkedIn because
14:23 that's where I felt like the majority of
14:25 the people were and it's easier just to
14:27 connect with people on LinkedIn
14:30 and say like, "Hey, I remember I would I
14:33 would tell um
14:35 uh hey I'm you know stuck inside and so
14:39 I wanted to do something useful with my
14:41 time inside
14:44 and I started this community if you're
14:47 interested in MLOps come join us and
14:50 then we it would be that so I was doing
14:53 a lot of outreach in the beginning a lot
14:55 of cold outreach and that was all me
14:59 like that's why in the beginning man I
15:00 was working like crazy it's a it's a lot
15:02 of work to try and set it up and it was
15:05 slow coming. Well, it felt like it was
15:07 like blowing up from the beginning, but
15:09 it would be like if we got 20 people in
15:12 the Slack and we had like 15 people in a
15:16 meetup, I was like, "Wow, there's so
15:18 many people and this is huge now." Uh,
15:22 and then
15:24 it I stopped. I remember there was a
15:26 point when I stopped doing outreach,
15:29 like probably like a month after we
15:30 started the community or maybe a
15:34 month and a half after we started it.
15:36 And what happened was is that people
15:39 kept coming into the community randomly.
15:42 I was like, whoa, how did that happen? I
15:44 haven't been telling people about it, so
15:47 where are they finding out about it? And
15:50 especially in the beginning it was just
15:51 me and somebody gave some great feedback
15:53 to me in the beginning when I was asking
15:56 for feedback. I you know like once or
15:58 twice a year we asked people to fill out
16:00 a form and give feedback. Somebody said
16:04 this is
16:06 not yet a community. They were like they
16:08 prefaced it nicely. They were like don't
16:10 take this the wrong way but I don't feel
16:12 this is a community yet. I feel this is
16:15 just Demetrios sharing stuff that he
16:18 finds online and thinks is useful. And
16:21 because in a way it was like I was the
16:25 most active member and I was always
16:27 trying to keep things happening, keep
16:29 things new so that people would come
16:31 back and trying to tag different people
16:34 into conversations.
16:36 But it wasn't like what you see now
16:38 where people ask questions and then
16:40 others answer them. I would always have
16:43 to be involved in some way. And then
16:46 yeah, I don't think we get like a
16:47 hundred a day unless you tweet out
16:49 something about the community. We
16:52 usually will get like a hundred a week,
16:55 I think, is probably more realistic on a
16:58 good week.
17:00 Sorry, the sun keeps coming out and in
17:03 and so my camera is being overexposed or
17:08 underexposed. But yeah, that that's that
17:12 did that answer the question?
17:13 Yeah, I think you did. So, first thing
17:15 you did was called outreach and I think
17:17 this these terms are coming from uh
17:20 sales, right? So, called outreach. Uh so
17:23 which means basically to translate it to
17:25 the language that most of us understand
17:27 is basically just writing random people
17:29 on LinkedIn saying hey join us join our
17:32 community uh let's talk about envelopes
17:35 and uh that uh helped to get some
17:38 traction then you also mentioned that uh
17:41 at the beginning it was just uh you
17:44 sharing some articles you found online
17:46 so just to keep the the place uh uh you
17:49 know live not yes just to okay this is
17:52 what I found. What do you think about
17:54 this? Right? And then eventually you
17:56 stopped doing this and uh and people
18:00 still u you know took took this on and
18:03 kept uh uh posting things u
18:08 questions answering.
18:09 Yeah.
18:11 Yeah. So it's a lot of hard work that
18:13 you did at the beginning right and uh
18:15 how for how long did you do this before
18:18 um stopping the the outreach? I think
18:20 you said for one month for one month.
18:22 Yeah, a month and a half. And also like
18:24 the other parts that were really hard
18:26 which you're going through now I'm sure
18:29 are the editing of videos. is I was
18:31 making a ton of clips and because I
18:34 wanted to just get our presence on
18:37 YouTube and so out of every hourong
18:40 session I would make like five or six
18:42 clips of my favorite answers and that
18:47 was a way for me to go back and like
18:48 review what people said. I remember it
18:51 would be like after the third or fourth
18:53 time watching it in the video editor I
18:56 would go like, "Oh, I kind of think I
18:58 know what they're talking about now." So
19:00 that helped me to you know get my MLOps
19:04 chops and then
19:08 uh
19:10 yeah probably like I I don't feel like
19:13 the community actually really got
19:15 rolling. So I remember really well
19:17 because in June
19:20 I remember telling a friend of mine that
19:23 if we can hit 500 Slack members that
19:27 will be like huge. that would be a a
19:29 great milestone.
19:31 And
19:32 so we hit that and then my friend asked,
19:36 "Well, what's next? Is it going to be a
19:39 thousand before the new year?" I was
19:41 like, "No way. That's a lot. We just,
19:44 you know, it took us three months or
19:46 four months to hit 500. Let's sustain
19:48 this growth. That's all I care about."
19:50 So like a thousand. Yeah. Before the new
19:53 year, maybe. But I'm not going to put
19:55 any pressure on myself. Uh, and so then
20:01 it was like because I figured that
20:02 everybody that cared about MLOps had
20:05 joined already. I didn't think there was
20:07 going to be that many people. And so
20:09 then
20:11 when we hit a thousand, it was right
20:13 around September and I was like, whoa,
20:15 that was fast. And then we hit 2,000
20:19 before the end of the year. And then now
20:21 we just hit 3,000. And it's like okay
20:23 this is doing that whole exponential
20:26 growth thing. Uh but with more people
20:29 comes different problems I would say or
20:33 different different things that you have
20:35 to worry about. In the beginning when it
20:37 was just like 10 people you knew
20:39 everyone and everyone knew you knew who
20:41 was active. Now it's like there's a ton
20:44 of people around and so you got to
20:46 moderate wisely.
20:51 What kind of problems you have? So,
20:53 first of all, a lot of people and most
20:55 of them you don't know and you need to
20:57 moderate. Are there some other problems
20:59 like spam or
21:02 scammers that come from your community?
21:06 Yes. So, so what kind of problems you
21:08 have and how do you deal with them?
21:11 Yeah. I mean, I think we talked about
21:13 this last week, right? Like the code of
21:15 conduct and
21:17 uh just random. So it feels like every
21:21 day that I'm trying to walk the fine
21:24 line of a what a vendor can and can't do
21:29 in the community because all the vendors
21:31 are really excited about MLOps community
21:35 and if they don't read the code of
21:37 conduct then they come in and they just
21:39 start like spraying their product all
21:42 over the place and it's like what are
21:44 you doing man first of all you're not
21:46 going to get many sales like that me
21:48 knowing as an ex salsalesman. But the
21:51 other thing is that
21:53 imagine if every we have a closed vendor
21:57 channel and there's over a hundred
21:58 people in that channel. Imagine if every
22:01 single one of those vendors did the same
22:03 thing. So then every thread would just
22:04 be like a hundred vendors spraying their
22:07 product. It's never going to create a
22:09 conducive environment for the community
22:12 to grow. And
22:16 that is one that gives me a bit of a
22:18 headache. Uh, and especially when it's
22:20 like, yeah, I know these guys. I've
22:22 talked to these guys. All of them. Most
22:23 of them I've interviewed. And so it's
22:26 like, come on, dude. We We know each
22:30 other. We've had conversations. And you
22:32 can't do that. And then when you say you
22:34 can't do that for one, then if another
22:37 one does it, they come to you and they
22:38 say, "Well, why can they do it?" So,
22:40 it's a lot of you you have more than one
22:43 kid, right?
22:44 No, just one.
22:45 H just one. Oh, well, I I kind of
22:47 compare it to like siblings and
22:50 I understand what you mean.
22:51 If one kid gets a candy, then I want a
22:53 candy, too.
22:54 So, that's not to say I don't want to
22:57 like dog on the vendors. I love the
22:58 vendors. are so happy that they're there
23:01 when they contribute their knowledge
23:03 because the vendors I feel like are some
23:05 of the most advanced the people with the
23:08 most advanced understanding of of MLOps
23:11 right now are the ones that are building
23:12 the tools. So if they come in and they
23:15 give their knowledge without like
23:18 creating a commercial out of it, it's
23:19 like that is so valuable for the
23:21 community. But as soon as it becomes,
23:24 hey, just try my product. It's cool. or
23:27 they reach out and they DM someone
23:29 because they saw a question that they
23:30 were asking in a channel, then it's
23:32 like, uh, dude, you can't do that.
23:37 Yeah.
23:38 Other problems. I don't know, man. Uh,
23:41 other stuff that's come up now. Ego
23:44 battles that you have with people, it's
23:46 like I try to just tell people, hey,
23:48 just be cool, be chill. This community
23:51 doesn't you don't need to like get riled
23:52 up about anything. We're talking about
23:54 MLOps. It's not politics.
23:57 It's just like chill.
23:59 So yeah, that kind of stuff.
24:04 Okay. So you basically need to keep an
24:06 eye uh cuz I I know sometimes I go to
24:09 general in envelopes uh and they see
24:12 okay there's some post from a vendor but
24:14 then 10 10 minutes after that it's gone
24:16 and I think it's probably you.
24:19 That's me having to go and reach out
24:21 directly to them.
24:23 Okay.
24:24 The audacity, the audacity kills me
24:27 where somebody they don't have any prior
24:30 knowledge of they come in. Imagine you
24:32 just come in to a Slack and then you go
24:35 to the general area and you just say,
24:39 "Look at my product. It's amazing." And
24:41 you before you even like introduce
24:43 yourself, before you do anything, that's
24:44 to me like you're that dog that just
24:46 peed all over fire hydrant. And now I
24:50 got to go clean it up because we have a
24:52 rule in this city that dogs can't pee on
24:55 fire hydrants.
24:57 Okay, that's the site that uh you don't
24:59 always see because like when uh I go
25:02 into to Malop's community, usually
25:04 generally it's clean, but because you
25:06 help to to help it stay clean, right?
25:09 Mhm.
25:10 Um you also mentioned one thing that I
25:12 wanted to talk a bit. Um so you said
25:14 that one feedback that you got was that
25:17 uh it was not yet a community
25:20 but now I think it is a community. So
25:21 how did you go from that uh that point
25:25 when it wasn't a community to the point
25:27 when it was like maybe did you even feel
25:30 like okay now it is a community now I
25:32 can call this place a community. And
25:34 what did you do to get there? I I wish I
25:38 knew the answer to that and I wish I
25:40 could say that it was anything that I
25:41 did because I know that it wasn't
25:45 anything that I did or it wasn't like
25:47 because of me because like I said I did
25:50 the data on Kubernetes community and I
25:52 also have the are you a robot
25:55 AI ethics community and neither of those
25:58 feel like they really hit the point
26:00 where it's like a community of people
26:03 talking to each other. So one thing that
26:07 I think is useful is getting the core
26:10 members to know each other so that there
26:13 are those
26:16 those moments where
26:18 you have the connection between people
26:22 and
26:23 then you see each other in Slack and
26:26 it's not like just some random
26:29 avatar picture. it's a person that
26:32 you've actually had a call with or you
26:34 you know and you know what the tone of
26:36 their voice is and you know the
26:37 inflection and you know if English is
26:39 their first language. So you have this
26:42 context and that makes people less shy
26:47 when it comes to
26:49 speaking up in Slack. I think the
26:52 majority of people that are in Slack are
26:54 just lurking and they're not saying
26:56 much. They're just looking at
26:58 everything. And a lot of people feel
27:01 like they don't have anything to
27:02 contribute and a lot of people just
27:04 don't want to contribute. Uh so you get
27:08 a lot of the same faces popping up and
27:10 those people especially in the beginning
27:12 they should know who one another
27:15 are.
27:17 How did you manage like how did did you
27:19 somehow try to connect them? I don't
27:21 know, create maybe a secret channel uh
27:24 kind of. Yeah, we created the MLOps
27:27 board in the beginning. Uh that since
27:31 has died out, but that was it. Yeah,
27:35 like just everybody who was super active
27:38 and I felt like had very interesting
27:41 things to contribute and I needed
27:44 somebody to bounce ideas off. I need
27:46 people to tell me if the ideas that I
27:48 had were crazy or not. Uh crazy in a
27:51 good way or crazy in a bad way. And so I
27:55 just went and I got all of the people
27:56 that I felt like were the most engaged.
27:58 And even people that were giving me like
28:01 critical feedback, I wanted them in
28:03 there, too, because I didn't want
28:06 everyone just to be like, "Yeah, this is
28:08 great." I wanted people to tell me,
28:10 "Hey, that meetup sucked." which some
28:12 people told me. And so I said, "All
28:14 right, you get a job on the board
28:17 and so that I could have I could field
28:21 the whole spectrum of like good and bad
28:24 and what what was useful to people and
28:27 what kind of people. So we created the
28:29 board in the beginning and I could ask
28:31 them their opinions on stuff and they
28:33 could also voice their opinions on
28:35 different changes that we made and
28:39 then from there it kind of fizzled out.
28:42 uh just because it wasn't being used as
28:44 much once the actual community
28:47 camaraderie took hold and so that's been
28:51 archived.
28:52 Okay.
28:52 I took a note anyways.
28:55 You took what?
28:56 I took a note.
28:57 Oh,
28:58 you know, I'm trying to squeeze as much
29:00 uh information from you as possible. So,
29:02 I'm taking notes.
29:04 So,
29:05 we have a question. Or maybe not a
29:07 question, but um
29:09 No way. There's people actually watching
29:10 us.
29:11 Yeah, 12 people. So, so, uh, one, it's
29:15 not a question, but, uh, more like a
29:18 comment. I've joined many communities in
29:20 the past, but have never truly felt like
29:22 I belonged.
29:24 Um, so what do you think about this?
29:26 Like, how how to make people feel
29:30 belonged to a community?
29:32 Ah, man, good question. And a lot of it
29:35 I think
29:37 is
29:38 a bit is on your side. Well, you the
29:42 questioner or whatever. Uh because
29:47 you have to put in a little bit of
29:49 effort. You can't expect especially when
29:51 it comes to Okay. So, if it's if it's a
29:54 in-person community, totally different
29:57 story, right?
29:58 What is in person community? If it's
30:01 like a community that you're getting
30:03 together, your neighborhood community or
30:06 your
30:07 like this offline community, right?
30:10 Yeah. Exactly.
30:10 Not in Slack.
30:11 Exactly. If it's an online community, I
30:14 think you really have to do some work to
30:17 get out there and put yourself out there
30:20 because people aren't going to
30:22 necessarily just like see your
30:25 introduction and then reach out to you
30:27 unless it's a really good introduction.
30:30 Uh, and even then you're not going to
30:31 get that many people reaching out to
30:33 you, right, for your introduction. But
30:35 what you, and that's something that I
30:38 try and do is when I see great
30:39 introductions or when I see people that
30:41 are in certain fields, I'll try and tag
30:45 them into different questions that
30:48 arise. Uh, but you're not going to get
30:52 like people coming with open arms if
30:56 you're not really showing anything about
30:59 you. Uh, so I think a part of that has
31:04 to be put on you. like you have to put
31:08 forth a little bit of effort and then
31:11 the rest is like how
31:14 toxic or non-toxic is a community or how
31:18 uh engaging is the community, how open
31:21 are the people that are in the community
31:24 and
31:25 what's the like point of the community.
31:28 So, right now you're seeing we're adding
31:31 all kinds of different channels in MLOps
31:34 that are not just for MLOps, right? Like
31:37 fun channels, funny channels, meme
31:39 channels, the like bad startup idea
31:41 channels, cat channels, all that because
31:45 we've had so many different channels.
31:48 The most I think the most important
31:50 channel is the questions and answers
31:52 channel and that's why people are going
31:54 to come when they have questions. That's
31:55 the the main draw. But then like again
31:58 this is coming back to MLOps as a
32:00 lifestyle. It's we're all in this
32:04 pandemic together and we don't really
32:06 have the communities that we can have.
32:09 We can't go to a meetup in our local
32:11 area and be there in person but we can
32:15 go to like a virtual meetup. So it's uh
32:19 it's that way. I don't know if that
32:20 answered the question or the comment.
32:23 Oh, so what I understood like the the
32:25 main takeaway for me was um first of all
32:29 you try to keep an eye on what's going
32:32 on like who are the people who join what
32:34 they uh what is their expertise like
32:37 what do they know and then if you see
32:39 that somebody is asking a question about
32:41 the area like something that they can
32:44 answer you try to talk them hey can you
32:46 u please help uh answer that question so
32:49 that's one thing but then it's not just
32:52 about MLOps, right? So there are people
32:54 have different interests. Somebody like
32:56 cat, somebody has uh um stories of fail
33:00 startups. Um like there also this my
33:03 favorite one um evangelism for example
33:06 like this is not related to Malops,
33:08 right? But still you you have this
33:09 channel so people can talk about other
33:12 things as well and that also creates a
33:14 sense of uh belonging, right? A sense of
33:17 community.
33:18 That's it.
33:19 Did I get it right?
33:20 Yeah. And not a not everyone is going to
33:22 be able to answer the crazy question
33:24 about if Docker Compose is similar to
33:27 Kubernetes.
33:29 And so what happens when I
33:33 don't have that kind of skill set, but I
33:36 still want to like contribute and be a
33:38 part and like reach out and talk to
33:40 people and and so aside from asking
33:43 questions,
33:45 maybe there's other groups that I can or
33:47 channels that I could get into and be a
33:50 part of and make connections in. Uh, at
33:54 least
33:56 if it's a cat channel and you have a
33:58 cat, there you go. That's an easy way to
34:00 do it, right?
34:04 What if you don't? Do you have a cat?
34:07 I have a cat.
34:08 Okay.
34:09 On your last legs right now, though. But
34:11 if we if you don't have a cat, you don't
34:13 have a dog. Go into the bad startup
34:16 ideas. I'm sure we all have a million
34:18 bad startup ideas in that channel.
34:21 There's enough for anyone.
34:24 Uh there is a personal question. Uh feel
34:26 free not to answer that but are you an
34:28 extrovert or introvert?
34:30 Uh so I would consider myself actually
34:33 it's funny. I really enjoy time alone
34:38 and I
34:41 consider myself an introvert but
34:43 everyone that knows me thinks I'm an
34:46 extrovert. extrovert and I don't
34:49 necessarily have so many problems
34:53 being with a lot of people
34:56 uh like spending a day at a conference
34:59 and talking to people but I definitely
35:01 am drained by the end and it's not like
35:05 that's I would prefer to just sit at
35:08 home and meditate.
35:12 think uh it think it matches the
35:14 definition of introvert who is uh you
35:17 know can talk to people but uh I think I
35:19 was reading u an article one day about
35:22 that so if somebody talks to people and
35:26 likes that doesn't mean they are not
35:28 necessarily uh extroverts right they
35:31 might be as well introverts they just uh
35:34 you know they just talk uh to people but
35:36 then they need a couple of uh uh days
35:40 off like off of talking right to to to
35:43 get the energy uh to talk because there
35:46 is a question um that is um like if
35:49 somebody is an introvert is it possible
35:52 for them to start a community and I
35:54 think you just answered that right
35:56 totally
35:57 totally
35:59 yeah I wouldn't like let that handicap
36:02 you at all I wouldn't even let the fact
36:04 that you don't know anything about the
36:06 specific industry that you're starting a
36:08 community around handicap you because
36:11 that's what I did and it worked out all
36:13 right.
36:16 Um do you think um your personality uh
36:20 helped in uh building the community?
36:24 Uh,
36:26 of course I always want to say yes.
36:30 But this is why I I have to be more
36:32 humble and realize that
36:35 I
36:37 tried to start well I I tried to start
36:40 two other communities and
36:43 didn't really go anywhere. It didn't
36:45 have the level of success that we've
36:47 seen with MLOps community. So
36:50 in that sense it's like
36:53 maybe but maybe not.
36:57 Okay. Because I I think being
36:59 charismatic at least this is my
37:01 impression of you like making jokes and
37:03 making fun of people in a good way. I
37:05 think this is uh like this is a good
37:08 thing right it makes uh events engaging
37:10 and I remember who you said like when I
37:13 was uh I don't remember if it was on the
37:15 interview uh that I did with the Malops
37:17 community or some other occasion uh it
37:20 was probably some internal meeting where
37:22 you were also hosting you said like I
37:24 enjoyed the 5 minutes of fame because of
37:28 my interview questions it was kind of
37:30 fun right I hear like these kind of
37:34 jokes and uh so I I think it definitely
37:36 played a role at least in uh in the
37:38 events. This is my personal observation.
37:41 I don't know about uh other uh but yeah
37:44 maybe also that uh you know the MLOps uh
37:48 is um is popular right? It's kind of
37:51 high.
37:51 Exactly.
37:53 While data on Kubernetes maybe not so
37:55 much.
37:56 Exactly. That's that's what it feels
37:59 like is that
38:01 maybe it's a little bit of everything.
38:04 It's not just
38:07 my personality or the personality,
38:09 whoever it is that wants to build a
38:11 community. It's uh
38:14 what are you building this community
38:15 about? How many communities are already
38:17 out there in this? Because I think
38:19 that's one thing with the MLOps
38:21 community is that there's not a lot of
38:23 communities out there for MLOps. I don't
38:26 know if there's really any other
38:28 communities to be honest. I mean you
38:30 have
38:31 but it's to like it's focused on two
38:34 right but
38:35 exactly exactly and so and that's
38:38 generally how it used to or how it goes
38:42 with communities I think you get
38:46 communities that are around a certain
38:50 tool
38:52 you don't really get communities like
38:53 yours or or well if we could call it
38:57 yours uh or ML ops community where
39:00 because the community is of no one,
39:02 right? That's one thing that's
39:04 important. I can't say this is my
39:06 community. I'm just a guy that talks a
39:08 lot in the community and interviews
39:10 people, but that doesn't make the
39:12 community mine. And so the
39:17 the
39:18 thing about it is that and I totally
39:22 lost where I was going with that. I
39:23 can't remember what I was saying
39:25 beforehand
39:27 but I I think that is one thing yeah
39:31 there's no ownership of a community but
39:34 the open-source communities are
39:36 generally around a certain tool and
39:39 these communities that we are in like
39:41 data talks club and MLOps they're around
39:44 a theme although your your theme I'm
39:48 still not sure what it is because it
39:49 feels like MLOps 2.0 Yeah, to me
39:53 well 2.0 means means that it's
39:57 maybe that's the well uh it's not just
40:01 about envelopes because I I'm not sure
40:04 but would would you have a similar talk
40:06 on Malops community about communities?
40:11 No, touch.
40:12 Touche, my man.
40:14 But I can right.
40:16 So it's brother. So it's not about
40:18 envelopes but about uh many different
40:21 things. And we have u quite a few
40:24 questions actually.
40:25 No way. People are actually watching us.
40:28 Yes. Uh 11 people and we have six
40:30 questions.
40:31 Hey, I like that. I like that the people
40:33 that are watching are engaged.
40:36 Yes. So Merritt, sorry if I don't
40:40 pronounce your name correctly. So
40:41 Merritt is asking how can we keep
40:43 communities active? I can see that a lot
40:46 of people come um with their passion in
40:49 the community but after a little while
40:51 they become inactive. So how can we try
40:54 to make these people active before it's
40:56 too late?
40:57 Yeah,
40:59 that is something I I'm not going to
41:01 like lie and say I know how to do that.
41:04 What I've done with the MLOps community
41:08 is
41:11 we try and have like giveaways. We have
41:14 trying to reach people in wherever
41:18 they're at. So that means having a lot
41:20 of content for them, whether that's a
41:22 blog or a meetup or a podcast or Slack
41:29 or um whatever it is that like their way
41:34 of consuming content and engaging,
41:38 that's where we're trying to to meet
41:40 them. and then a newsletter.
41:43 And in these different things, like you
41:46 have cool community stuff that anyone
41:49 can get involved in with like giveaways
41:53 or making the video or
41:58 uh
41:59 yeah, that that's mainly like the the
42:02 main things I'm thinking of to try and
42:05 keep people engaged and coming back. And
42:09 the other thing that is
42:13 I think there's something to be said
42:15 like people like don't take it
42:17 personally if people don't come back.
42:19 There's everyone's got their own
42:22 life that they're living and maybe
42:24 somebody doesn't come back. They fall
42:25 off
42:26 because they just had a kid
42:28 and there's no amount of anything that
42:31 you could have done to make that person
42:33 not fall off, right? And so like if you
42:38 see that there is a huge like your
42:40 community is is quiet and there's not
42:43 really new people that are engaging then
42:46 maybe you need to take a pulse check and
42:48 see if the community is healthy. But I
42:53 wouldn't be worried if you're seeing
42:58 like, hey, there's people that come and
43:00 they engage and then they fall off.
43:03 Mhm.
43:04 Because life happens and maybe it's like
43:06 a Slack fatigue.
43:09 They just go through
43:10 just internet fatigue. Right now we are
43:12 stuck at home and just too much online,
43:14 right?
43:14 We've been at home for one year. So now
43:17 it's like maybe they say, "Well, my New
43:20 Year's resolution is to do less with
43:23 communities." Who knows?
43:25 So yeah, don't take it personally at all
43:27 and just keep if you hold yourself to
43:30 high quality and you make sure that
43:32 whatever you're doing and this is one
43:34 thing somebody told me who I can't
43:36 remember if it was I think it was in a
43:38 blog post that I read about DBT's blog.
43:42 Shout out to DBT.
43:45 uh they didn't do they purposely didn't
43:50 like gamify their community and that for
43:55 me was really validating because I had
43:58 thought about the whole gamifying
44:00 what do you mean by gamifying
44:02 like giving people badges and like
44:06 making people admins or whatever and so
44:12 um
44:14 like I said, "No, I don't want to gamify
44:16 it because it doesn't feel right to me."
44:19 And they wrote out a nice long few
44:24 paragraphs as to why that for them
44:27 wasn't the way to go. And I also felt
44:29 like that wasn't the way to go. I don't
44:31 want people to come just because it'll
44:33 give them like points on a scoreboard,
44:37 right? So that's uh that's that.
44:41 Yeah. And I think they are doing really
44:43 amazing. Last time I checked it was uh
44:46 like 9,000 members but then not last
44:50 time but uh the one before last and then
44:52 last time I checked it was 12,000.
44:54 Yeah.
44:54 So it was just over a month. That is
44:56 amazing. And I have still I have no idea
45:00 what DBT is actually doing like as a
45:02 tool. Uh I just know it's it's popular.
45:06 But yeah, it's amazing like uh and with
45:08 CubeFlow it's also like communities that
45:10 grow around a tool that become popular.
45:13 It's interesting to see what they
45:15 actually how they managed to do this.
45:17 How did they manage to attract? Because
45:19 some people I talked to a few people who
45:23 uh who told me a few words about this
45:25 DBT community. They are there not
45:27 because of DBT but because of other
45:28 things because of the people who can
45:31 they who they can talk to there not
45:33 because they used the tool but rather um
45:36 people who are there who have a certain
45:38 profile like analytics or analytics
45:40 engineers and to be able to talk to
45:42 them.
45:43 So that's u yeah. So, we have a question
45:46 from Scott. Um, how often do you do
45:49 custodev? Do you do you know what is
45:52 that?
45:52 No. What? What was that? Custodev.
45:55 Kasdev. I think it's uh um like talking
45:58 to users. Um
46:00 Oh, customer development.
46:01 Yes, exactly.
46:02 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You do that.
46:04 I do that. So, I do at least twice a
46:08 year we'll send out a
46:11 form and I realized you got to give some
46:15 incentive for people to fill out the
46:17 form. So,
46:18 was it Amazon gift card for you?
46:20 Yeah. Well,
46:21 I think Yeah, I remember that.
46:23 I think Yeah, I think we did Amazon
46:24 actually. Or did we do the most recent
46:28 one? I know that we did. There's this
46:30 really cool um it's like a gift card,
46:34 but it's for charity giving. So, I give
46:39 you a gift card and then you can go and
46:41 use that gift card, that money that I
46:43 gave you for
46:45 a donation to a charity.
46:48 So, we've we've started doing that
46:49 instead because I like that better than
46:51 just giving Amazon a bunch of money. I
46:53 already give them enough money on a
46:55 day-to-day basis.
46:57 Uh, but maybe the people that win it are
46:59 like, I didn't want this. I would much
47:01 rather want an Amazon gift card where I
47:04 can buy something actually useful. But
47:07 giving is a very powerful feeling. It
47:10 feels good to give. So, I decided to go
47:13 with that. And
47:15 what do you have in the form?
47:16 What?
47:17 What do you have in the form?
47:20 Oh, I ask I try and ask about
47:24 what we're not doing right. What the
47:26 least favorite part of the community is.
47:28 I really try and go deep into like what
47:30 would you do differently? Why don't you
47:34 why why don't you like what you don't
47:36 like?
47:37 Uh and then what's your favorite like
47:41 ways what's your favorite part about the
47:44 community? Where do you do you consume
47:46 the content? Are you a part of the
47:48 newsletter? Are you like um should I
47:52 curse less in the newsletters?
47:56 That kind of stuff.
47:57 Do you curse often in the newsletters? I
47:59 don't remember.
48:00 No, just occasionally.
48:03 Okay.
48:03 So, the the thing is that I'll do that
48:07 at least twice a year. And I only I do
48:10 that twice a year because
48:12 I feel like it's a lot of work to get
48:13 people to fill it out. So that's why I
48:16 don't want to like flood them with it
48:17 every month. And then I do reach out to
48:21 random people quite a lot. And that's
48:24 the beauty of being the community
48:26 organizer, right? You have an excuse to
48:28 reach out to people.
48:30 And so I reach out to people and I talk
48:32 to them about the community and I tell
48:34 them I appreciate their presence there.
48:36 and I don't do one-on- ons with them,
48:39 but I I just like to start chatting with
48:42 them and see if there's anything that
48:44 comes up. The other thing that I'll do
48:48 is because I have this idea in my head
48:51 of different people that are in the
48:54 community that are specialized in
48:56 certain things. If we have a
49:00 podcast that comes out about a certain
49:04 thing or we want to make a podcast about
49:07 a certain theme, which is different than
49:10 just like the podcast where you and I
49:12 are interviewing each other, we're
49:13 starting to do like more produced
49:15 podcasts where we have a theme and then
49:19 we get different opinions from people
49:22 and
49:22 like a panel discussion or
49:24 No. Have you ever listened to Radio Lab?
49:28 No.
49:28 No. So, I'm not going to say that we're
49:32 trying to do Radio Lab because Radio Lab
49:34 is really good.
49:35 I should listen to that and maybe also
49:37 do this at Data Talks Club.
49:40 Exactly, man.
49:43 But you're I'm telling you, you as one
49:46 man, you're going to have fun trying to
49:48 do it. This is where like it's great to
49:50 involve the community with different
49:52 initiatives. That's another thing. It
49:54 goes back to that other question, right?
49:56 Like how do you keep people engaged? Get
49:58 them involved in initiatives. Get people
50:01 doing different stuff and the way that
50:03 you get them like everybody's got
50:06 something that they probably want to do.
50:08 And so yeah, like open it up to them and
50:11 use the community as the place to let
50:13 them have their forum because if it's
50:16 only me creating the initiatives that I
50:19 want, it's going to be my community.
50:21 Again, it's not a uh us thing. It's like
50:26 I'm the dictator and
50:28 you're you're it's there's that classic
50:31 phrase like are you building a community
50:32 or are you building an audience
50:36 and an audience is like one to many,
50:38 right? So, uh the community is many to
50:43 many I think.
50:45 So, that's that the that's yeah that's
50:49 that for that question.
50:50 Yeah. Thanks. There is a followup like
50:52 it's actually it was two two questions
50:54 in one. The first one how often do you
50:56 do Kazdev and the second one in the same
50:58 question from Sat is do you do a random
51:01 coffee practice? And I think you said
51:02 that you don't have one once because
51:05 this is what I think is random coffee. I
51:07 have no idea actually. Maybe you know
51:09 what?
51:10 Yeah. So we just started the uh there's
51:14 that app in Slack donut.
51:17 Mhm. Okay. This is uh this is I I used
51:20 it at work we have at work. Um but
51:24 random coffee I I don't know. So 101 for
51:26 castdev it feels to me that um you are
51:30 the community manager and you reach out
51:32 to community members to see what's going
51:34 on to keep the pulse on uh like to to
51:37 know um what's going on. But um maybe
51:40 random coffee is something like to go
51:42 from this uh um how you said audience to
51:45 a community to many to many right and
51:47 this is what donut and random coffee is
51:50 about isn't it? Yeah. And I think but
51:52 that's Yeah, that's true. Like when
51:54 other people are in donut, they're not
51:56 asking specific questions about the
51:58 community, but it is a way for me to
52:02 have an excuse to randomly be matched
52:04 with someone and have a meeting with
52:07 them and and see what their thoughts are
52:09 on the community. And uh and honestly,
52:12 one I will say this, a lot of the time
52:15 it's people that are reaching out to me
52:18 that I do have one-on- ones with.
52:20 And so I do I would say like the
52:23 customer development and if we want to
52:25 call it a customer in the the MLOps
52:28 community because they're not a customer
52:29 but I understand that some people that
52:31 are watching this they may be watching
52:33 this for a
52:36 product or a company and they're doing
52:39 they're tasked with community at their
52:41 company and
52:44 to have so those people that reach out
52:49 to me. I generally 99% of the time will
52:54 sit down and have one-on- ones with them
52:56 and then when we're talking to them like
52:58 usually it's an ask when they reach out
53:00 to me they want information or they want
53:02 something they want to do something with
53:04 the community or whatever
53:05 be on your podcast right
53:07 yeah so many of those
53:09 from vendors right
53:11 what
53:12 vendors
53:14 there's a lot of that too uh if it's a
53:16 vendor I it's not that I don't meet with
53:18 them it's that so I do meet with most
53:21 you know why I meet with everybody is
53:23 because I again I came from sales and I
53:27 know how
53:29 important it was for me to book meetings
53:32 and I know how it was like really huge
53:35 when I would get feedback even if it
53:37 wasn't anybody that wasn't going to buy
53:40 and so to have a meeting so usually when
53:42 people reach out to me now especially if
53:45 it's like hey I have a community or hey
53:48 I like what you're doing with the
53:50 community. They play to my ego and it's
53:52 my soft spot and then
53:55 I meet with them. And I feel like it
53:58 would be very hypocritical of me to not
54:01 meet with these people when I'm going
54:03 and I'm reaching out to people every day
54:05 to try and get them on the podcast and
54:08 I'm reaching out cold and asking them to
54:09 spend like an hour with me. So, if I
54:12 don't do it to people that reach out to
54:15 me, it's a little bit like it's not
54:19 cool. However, I will ask that they
54:21 clarify like and they give like a really
54:23 clear idea of what they want to talk
54:26 about.
54:28 So, it's not just like random because
54:30 that has happened a few times.
54:32 Yeah, that has happened a few times and
54:34 I've been like, uh,
54:37 okay, this is a waste of my time.
54:42 Oh, but most of the time it's not like
54:44 that, right?
54:45 No. And most of the time they're amazing
54:47 conversations and I make a friend out of
54:49 it.
54:50 Okay, we still have quite a few
54:53 questions. Are you in hurry to
54:56 No, I'm good for time. Let me just
54:58 double check that we're all good here.
55:01 Yeah, I'm good for another 30 minutes.
55:03 Okay. U we probably will not need that
55:06 much, but maybe 10 minutes more. Yeah.
55:09 So again a question from SWAT U sorry if
55:12 I don't pronounce your name correctly.
55:14 Do you believe that community needs a
55:16 leader or a media person to drive the
55:18 community forward or maybe a community
55:21 can live independently?
55:23 So I think again this is coming back to
55:27 like what kind of community are we
55:29 talking about? If it's a community like
55:32 MLOps
55:34 probably not. So, I'm just basically
55:37 saying my I'm not necessary in
55:41 the but you
55:43 it's going to be and I've talked to
55:45 other people about this. This is why
55:47 from my experience talking to others
55:49 because I don't know I've never done it
55:52 where there is no leader right because
55:54 I've done it always where I try and
55:57 jumpstart the community and talking to
56:00 others where they like try and be more
56:05 democratic about things, I guess, if you
56:08 want to call it that. It just takes so
56:10 much longer for things to get done
56:14 and you end up being so slow. Like for
56:18 me, I've noticed that like as soon as we
56:20 start adding in complexity to the MLOps
56:24 community and we have like sprint
56:26 meetings now where we have the different
56:27 initiatives that we're working on and we
56:29 have the different because there's so
56:32 many things. There's so many plates
56:33 moving now, right? Like it's not just
56:36 the meetups or the podcast or the
56:38 newsletter. Now we have like reading
56:40 club and we have the website whole
56:42 revamp where we're going to be comparing
56:44 the tools and we have the engineering
56:46 labs and we have the new podcast series.
56:50 We have so much that's happening with
56:53 all of that and so like to keep a vision
56:55 on all of that. Oh and office hours
56:59 which you drop into uh and then women of
57:03 it's like five or six. I I was trying to
57:06 count and take a note because you know I
57:07 want to to do the same.
57:10 Good thing is it's recorded so you can
57:12 go back and watch.
57:12 Yes, that's that's a good thing. But
57:14 it's amazing like I counted six things
57:17 or five I don't remember but that's that
57:20 that's a lot right. So how
57:22 I know that you're not alone. there is
57:24 David u there are other people who help
57:26 you but how do you even like as a team
57:28 of three people or I I don't know how
57:31 how many exactly how do you keep up with
57:34 all that so we have the sprint plannings
57:39 that help and then just giving people a
57:42 lot of autonomy and recognizing that it
57:44 is a community and people aren't getting
57:47 paid so like not really pressuring them
57:49 or holding them to what they say so much
57:52 uh And but th this is where again like
57:57 where we can you have to be very clear
58:00 about what you're going for
58:02 and you can engage more people in the
58:06 community like you can get people more
58:09 interested and so with like the website
58:12 we that's probably like what's taken the
58:14 longest because we're engaging so many
58:16 people when it's just me I do fast
58:20 right like it's like okay I gotta Uh,
58:23 it was me in the beginning and it was me
58:25 doing it and I was working myself to the
58:27 bone. But now it's a lot more of a
58:31 community feel and I still have the
58:34 things that I'm doing. Like the things
58:36 that I'm doing just have momentum.
58:39 So, they're happening. But then there's
58:40 all this other crazy stuff that we think
58:42 up and we think, well, this could be
58:44 cool. Let's try that or what about if we
58:46 did this or what about if we did that?
58:48 And then we see who in the community
58:50 wants to get involved
58:52 and we see if it's actually a viable
58:57 option.
58:58 Uh so yeah, like with all those
59:01 different things, it's really hard to
59:04 get. Imagine if you had like six things
59:06 going on and you didn't have a leader
59:09 and you had the amount of people that we
59:11 have working on them. Like imagine you
59:14 had 20 people and it was like everybody
59:16 was just like, "Well, my thing is the
59:18 most important or I think we should do
59:19 it like this."
59:20 And then nobody actually has decision-
59:22 makingaking power, then it's really
59:25 difficult to get anything done. I'm not
59:27 saying it's bad. It's totally a viable
59:30 way to go about doing your stuff. If you
59:33 want to have and structure the your
59:35 community like that, go for it. Uh I
59:38 coming from Spain I know and especially
59:41 in the northern part of Spain in the Bas
59:43 country that was like the de facto way
59:45 of doing everything. I would just say it
59:48 was the biggest pain in the ass for me
59:50 because I wanted to just go and so to
59:53 like go through all of the bureaucracy
59:57 we could call it even though it's not
59:59 bureaucracy but to go through all of
1:00:01 that it was a lot of work and it it
1:00:04 slowed me down and then I would lose
1:00:06 interest but if I'm just like okay I can
1:00:09 do this and I'm just going to go then
1:00:11 boom I'm going to be much more inspired
1:00:16 and Um there's a question from anonymous
1:00:18 but I also wanted to ask that question.
1:00:20 How big is your team?
1:00:23 Uh right now I'd say like core team
1:00:28 there's four of us.
1:00:29 Okay.
1:00:30 But then there's like people working on
1:00:33 the different initiatives.
1:00:35 Mhm. So with those people that are
1:00:38 outside of it, I would say there's
1:00:40 probably like 10
1:00:43 or maybe maybe we could stretch it to
1:00:45 like
1:00:48 12 15.
1:00:51 Yeah, that's that's amazing.
1:00:54 Um,
1:00:56 do you consider a community a business
1:00:59 and uh what is it's a community? So not
1:01:03 necessarily the MLOps community but in
1:01:05 general a community. Uh that's again a
1:01:07 question from SAT. Um and if yes what is
1:01:11 the business goal would be like what
1:01:13 would be the business goal for that
1:01:14 community?
1:01:16 That's a awesome question. So I look at
1:01:19 it I tend to look at it as yes.
1:01:24 And the goal though in my mind is to
1:01:28 create a place where people can learn
1:01:30 and they can share and they can
1:01:32 interact. So it's not like the goal is
1:01:35 to make profits for our shareholders.
1:01:40 It's to create like a place where people
1:01:43 can get the most value in this specific
1:01:48 space. And so that's how I look at MLOps
1:01:53 community. communities in general. There
1:01:55 are so many different ways like we
1:01:57 talked about is it an open source one?
1:01:59 If it's an open source community, I
1:02:00 would argue even more like yes, it's a
1:02:04 business because you see so many
1:02:07 different companies that are
1:02:10 being created on top of open source.
1:02:13 And
1:02:16 so the value like what is the goal of
1:02:20 the business? If it's an open source
1:02:22 thing, if it's a business on top of an
1:02:25 open source community, then there then
1:02:27 it's obvious like the goal is to make
1:02:29 money. But the community looking at it
1:02:32 as a business and looking at it as like
1:02:34 you want to have it be a place that
1:02:36 thrives and is constantly attracting new
1:02:40 customers and has the marketing side and
1:02:42 it has the product side even though the
1:02:46 product of the community I'm not sure
1:02:47 what that would be other than like the
1:02:50 different initiatives that are brought
1:02:53 on.
1:02:54 Yeah. podcasts or news newsletters, more
1:02:57 marketing, but like yeah, that could
1:02:59 probably be the
1:03:02 the way that we're running MLOps
1:03:04 community is like it's an educational
1:03:07 business. We're just not getting the
1:03:10 people are are learning. They're not
1:03:13 paying for their learning, which is fine
1:03:16 with me right now. And I don't want it
1:03:18 to be like behind a payw wall. And we
1:03:20 had thought about we threw around ideas
1:03:22 of creating courses but and in the end
1:03:26 we said no we're not going to do it
1:03:29 right now because a everything's moving
1:03:31 too fast by the time we launch a course
1:03:34 who knows where it'll be.
1:03:36 Yeah. CubeFlow for example like uh if
1:03:39 you record the record the course now
1:03:41 like in one month the API changes and
1:03:44 yeah
1:03:46 and you'll always have to continue
1:03:47 updating that and it's also
1:03:50 uh who knows if even CubeFlow is going
1:03:53 to be around in a year or two right like
1:03:56 who knows if so that's not that's a
1:03:59 little bit of a copout as to why we
1:04:01 didn't start a course it just felt like
1:04:04 a lot of squeezing for the juice.
1:04:08 So,
1:04:10 does that answer the question?
1:04:11 Yeah, I think it does. So, we still have
1:04:13 quite a few questions, but I think uh
1:04:15 people are actually listening to us.
1:04:17 This is amazing.
1:04:17 Yes. Yes, exactly. And there are still
1:04:19 10 people. So, you remember 12 and uh 10
1:04:24 of them. Well, excluding me because I'm
1:04:26 still watching it from my phone. But so,
1:04:29 nine people are there. And uh so let's I
1:04:32 want to select the last one um for
1:04:36 today. Um so if somebody wants to uh
1:04:40 start a community right now in a
1:04:43 familiar topic so in a topic they know
1:04:45 about what would you uh suggest them to
1:04:48 do? What are the main five points you
1:04:51 want you will suggest them to do?
1:04:53 Figure out where you want the community
1:04:55 to be.
1:04:57 So is it going to be in Slack? Is it
1:04:58 going to be in Discord? is going to be
1:05:00 on there's a lot of new like community
1:05:03 tools that are coming up uh like Circle
1:05:07 and
1:05:08 Commisser I think I told you I had a
1:05:10 demo with them
1:05:12 they're not they're more of an analytics
1:05:14 tool for your community I think but
1:05:17 there are tools that look scary scarily
1:05:22 like Facebook but it's like for your
1:05:24 community
1:05:25 uh so a like figure out where you want
1:05:28 your community to live. At least in the
1:05:31 beginning, it should probably just be on
1:05:33 one of these platforms and then when you
1:05:35 grow bigger, you can go into forums and
1:05:38 Slack or Discord and Slack and have them
1:05:42 both.
1:05:43 Then what's the common goal that unites
1:05:47 the community?
1:05:49 What is it like? Why would anyone want
1:05:52 to come and be a part of this community?
1:05:56 and what are they coming there for?
1:05:59 I think figure out those questions
1:06:02 and then how are you going to feed that
1:06:06 hunger that they have? Is it just going
1:06:09 to be people talking on Slack? Are you
1:06:13 going to create blog posts? Are you
1:06:15 going to or create content in general?
1:06:17 It could be a podcast. It could be
1:06:18 newsletter. Whatever.
1:06:21 Like what is it that is going to
1:06:25 element? Is that a word? No. To feed
1:06:28 them and to give to yeah nurture the
1:06:33 community in that way. And then once you
1:06:38 know that and you know like who are
1:06:40 people that are going to be in the
1:06:42 community because you have this common
1:06:45 thread then you can go and start finding
1:06:48 them wherever they are and start talking
1:06:50 to them and mention how you have a
1:06:53 community also or you have this
1:06:56 community that you just started and so
1:06:57 for me it was easy finding them on
1:06:59 LinkedIn. It's easy if it's a
1:07:02 professional facing community. I think
1:07:05 it's going to be a lot harder if it's
1:07:07 like toe fetish community. Where do you
1:07:10 find those people? Because I know you're
1:07:13 into that, Alexi. So, I'm wondering
1:07:16 where do you guys hang out?
1:07:19 I'll tell you offline.
1:07:24 You got all red, too. Sorry to make you
1:07:27 blush. and tell all of your followers
1:07:29 that you're into that. But
1:07:35 so yeah, like where do you find them? I
1:07:38 I generally think it's easier to find
1:07:40 people on LinkedIn if it's around a
1:07:45 a professional network kind of thing.
1:07:49 There's also you could technically like
1:07:51 a Facebook group is a community. So
1:07:55 maybe that's where you find people and
1:07:58 maybe you find them in the comments
1:08:00 section of a YouTube video. What is it
1:08:04 that is where do these people hang out
1:08:07 and why are they going to want to go
1:08:09 hang out in this community that you're
1:08:12 starting?
1:08:14 Okay. So fifth one because the question
1:08:17 was about main five points and you just
1:08:19 had four. Oh,
1:08:22 fifth one would be Yeah,
1:08:26 I feel like I covered it though, man.
1:08:28 Like,
1:08:28 so yeah, maybe summarize
1:08:30 these people.
1:08:31 Yeah, so first you said find out where
1:08:34 like the platform. Then uh why like why
1:08:37 people should join, right? The goal of
1:08:39 the community. Then the third one was um
1:08:42 how uh like how do you want to attract
1:08:46 people and then where do you find them?
1:08:48 So that was the four things.
1:08:50 Yeah. I think the why and the how are a
1:08:53 little bit more nuanced than that. The
1:08:55 why is
1:08:59 why do people want to join this
1:09:02 community? Why do people even care? Like
1:09:06 what is the common thread
1:09:09 that unites them? What is the answers
1:09:12 they are looking for or the what are
1:09:14 they seeking
1:09:16 and how are you going to be giving them
1:09:20 those answers?
1:09:24 Okay.
1:09:26 Well, I think that's uh
1:09:28 these four are good enough, right? To
1:09:31 start.
1:09:31 I hope so. Yeah.
1:09:32 If I think of another one along the way,
1:09:35 I'll do I'll tell you.
1:09:37 Yeah. And to answer your question, where
1:09:39 to find people that that are let's say
1:09:43 not the professional community. I think
1:09:44 on Reddit you can find all sorts of
1:09:46 people
1:09:47 also. Yeah.
1:09:49 And not just uh you know those who are
1:09:51 in into data science but other sort of
1:09:54 people as well. I mean I didn't mean
1:09:56 other like exactly this is what I meant.
1:10:00 Um yeah well I think that's all uh for
1:10:04 today. Thanks a lot for joining us today
1:10:07 for uh for a chat uh sharing your
1:10:10 expertise. Actually, I took like um
1:10:12 three pages of notes which are quite
1:10:15 actionable.
1:10:17 You'll see more initiative coming up
1:10:19 from datab.
1:10:28 What?
1:10:28 Not everything. Oh,
1:10:30 most of it. No, it's good. I of course
1:10:33 if I wasn't fully supportive of you
1:10:37 making a MLOps 2.0 I wouldn't be here
1:10:40 right now. I think it's great what
1:10:42 you're doing and you have you have
1:10:45 really interesting stuff going on and
1:10:48 then also like talking to you about this
1:10:53 is really cool because it helps me
1:10:54 formulate my ideas and I've thought
1:10:57 about it quite a bit like should I just
1:11:00 start making YouTube videos about
1:11:02 creating community how I know how to
1:11:04 create it. I'm not going to claim to be
1:11:06 an expert in communities because I know
1:11:08 there are a lot of people out there with
1:11:10 a lot more experience than myself. I
1:11:13 just want to tell the story of how I
1:11:16 created it, what's worked for me, what
1:11:18 I've tried, what didn't work in these
1:11:22 three communities that I've created thus
1:11:24 far. And so, thanks everybody for
1:11:27 listening. Like, I can't believe that
1:11:30 they're still listening. Everyone talk
1:11:33 already now. the there are still uh nine
1:11:35 well except me like eight people that
1:11:37 are still uh in the stream. So that's uh
1:11:41 that's that's su that's yeah a
1:11:44 successful steam I would say
1:11:46 it's pretty cool that people are
1:11:47 interested in this.
1:11:48 Yeah and maybe there's an idea for your
1:11:50 fourth community. It's community about
1:11:53 communities.
1:11:54 That's kind of meta.
1:11:56 Yes, it is.
1:11:57 I like it though. That's if right now
1:12:01 honestly you'll see like
1:12:04 you just I'm just trying to keep up with
1:12:06 MLOps
1:12:08 so much and figure out how how to keep
1:12:12 it in a uh
1:12:14 healthy community state.
1:12:17 Okay. Yeah. Well, uh good luck with
1:12:21 that.
1:12:22 Do I get to do a shameless plug now?
1:12:24 Yes, please.
1:12:26 No, I'm joking. That's was
1:12:28 Yeah. So, how can people
1:12:29 shameless plugs?
1:12:30 So, how can people find your community?
1:12:34 Just go to mlops.com community
1:12:37 online.
1:12:38 Are you on Twitter?
1:12:40 What
1:12:40 are you on Twitter as well?
1:12:42 Yep. MLOps community. We don't have that
1:12:46 many followers, but we are there and we
1:12:48 generally just post about stuff that
1:12:50 we're doing. We have like all these
1:12:52 different initiatives that I talked
1:12:54 about. If anyone wants to get in get
1:12:56 involved with the initiatives, I imagine
1:12:58 people that are watching have something
1:13:01 to do with data science or ML or MLOps
1:13:04 in general, but we've got a lot of stuff
1:13:08 going on. So, if you want to get
1:13:10 involved, come reach out to me. If you
1:13:13 just want to keep talking, like I said,
1:13:16 I usually take most meetings when people
1:13:18 reach out to me. So, if I didn't answer
1:13:20 all of your questions here, feel free to
1:13:23 send me a LinkedIn connect and we can go
1:13:27 from there.
1:13:28 Yeah, there are still six questions that
1:13:30 we didn't answer.
1:13:31 So, there we go.
1:13:32 Yeah, I'm sorry, but uh yeah, we don't
1:13:35 have that much time. Maybe for the next
1:13:37 episode,
1:13:40 can we please call it MLOps as a
1:13:43 lifestyle?
1:13:44 Yes. Okay. and see if anyone shows up.
1:13:47 We'll compare it and we'll just compare
1:13:49 it by the name and so we'll know which
1:13:51 one
1:13:52 was more popular as a name.
1:13:56 Okay. Yes. So, thanks a lot. Thanks
1:13:59 everyone for staying on the on the
1:14:02 stream and thanks Demetus for coming and
