0:00 hello everyone welcome to our event this
0:02 event is brought to you by later rocks
0:04 club which is a community of people who
0:05 love data we have three weekly events
0:08 this is one of such events if you want
0:10 to find out more about the events we
0:12 have
0:12 go to the description there is a link
0:15 click on this and you'll see
0:17 all the events we have in our schedule
0:19 then if you haven't subscribed to our
0:20 youtube channel now it's the best time
0:22 to do this you will get notified about
0:24 all the videos we have in our channel
0:26 and then finally the most important
0:28 thing join our amazing slack where you
0:30 can talk to other data enthusiasts
0:32 during today's interview you can ask any
0:34 question you want
0:36 go to live chat there is a pinned link
0:39 click on this link and ask your question
0:42 and now actually i don't remember if i
0:43 pinned this link i will go check it
0:48 it is not print so now i pin it
0:52 and
0:56 are you ready
0:58 oh yeah
1:00 yeah and i'm almost ready as well
1:08 okay so this week we'll talk about
1:11 hacking your data career and we have a
1:13 special guest marian marian is a
1:16 sociologist and a data scientist he
1:18 works at capgemini did i pronounce it
1:20 correctly
1:22 i had to i had to look it up
1:24 you pronounced my name correctly
1:26 everything's fine
1:28 i i trained okay so
1:30 mariah works at cub gemini as a data
1:33 scientist manager and i think last time
1:35 we had you on our event you were a
1:37 senior data scientist so
1:41 what comes after senior data scientist i
1:43 don't know so now i'm managing data
1:45 scientists which is great because i get
1:48 less recruitment spam now because
1:50 clearly everyone's just control f's
1:52 senior data scientist and that's it and
1:54 i don't fall in that category anymore so
1:56 easy
1:58 so you have probably seen mariah talking
2:00 about doing good with data
2:02 for example in our events
2:05 and
2:06 yeah in general you probably have seen
2:08 him in linkedin posting stuff about data
2:11 other topics cats
2:13 and other things
2:14 so welcome to our event man
2:17 thank you for having me
2:19 yeah so with your name i think i had
2:21 because you already had an hour event
2:23 last time so i had to train myself a
2:25 little bit
2:26 so before we go into our main topic of
2:28 hacking the data career let's start with
2:31 your background
2:32 can you tell us about your career
2:34 journey so far sure thing it starts
2:38 like nine years ago that's painful to
2:40 admit when i started out studying
2:42 sociology and my dad told me man you're
2:44 never gonna get a job like that social
2:46 you does that
2:48 but what i learned during my study was
2:50 okay predict electoral election outcomes
2:54 uh model twitter data and and discourse
2:57 how to mine social media that kind of
2:59 stuff because even though a lot of
3:00 social science focuses on human behavior
3:03 qualitatively like interview surveys etc
3:07 you can also do so quantitatively which
3:09 means i was modeling pandemics even
3:12 before covid was cool i did ebola good
3:14 times that one we managed to contain
3:17 um for my and for my graduation i was
3:19 modeling how many people get stabbed in
3:21 my hometown of rotterdam and what what
3:23 the main
3:24 neighborhood um circumstances could
3:27 predict
3:28 uh lower or higher numbers of stabbings
3:31 and drug crime and such
3:33 and
3:34 then i met cab gemini and
3:36 and the the entire field of data science
3:38 told me man that's cool that's data
3:40 science and ai and i thought it was just
3:42 statistics and distinctively not sexy
3:45 and i said sure now please give me a job
3:47 and that's how i became a data scientist
3:53 that was very short
3:55 i just i got comfortable listening to
3:58 your stories because you have a good way
4:01 of telling stories
4:02 like i can go on for a few more yeah
4:06 but the main point here
4:08 and that's also something we're going to
4:09 talk about a lot today i think
4:12 is that i stand out in the field of data
4:14 science because of my background
4:16 but that and that has
4:19 little to do specifically with social
4:21 science and more with that your
4:23 background actually determines a lot of
4:25 your competitive advantage
4:28 in data science it's not about knowing
4:30 the same stuff as the next guy or girl
4:33 it's about what you know that they don't
4:36 know i see tons of kids these days
4:39  their pants as they look at the
4:41 labor market and they try to know the
4:43 deep learning algorithms better than
4:45 their peers
4:46 that is a tough thing to compete on try
4:49 to compete on the things that you know
4:51 that they don't know
4:53 rather than the same things that's how i
4:56 got lucky
4:58 so what do you know that they don't know
5:01 sociology
5:03 oh i did a mixture of sociology
5:06 criminology and quite some statistics
5:08 um so i remember
5:10 one of my very first projects we had um
5:13 we were modeling the effects of gender
5:16 and my computer science and ai peers
5:18 because we're working working in a team
5:21 we're like okay how do we test that and
5:23 i'm like oh checking for gender bias i
5:26 know that i studied that crap four years
5:29 so yes i studied bias and discrimination
5:32 and algorithms for four years was told
5:34 i'd never get a job and i hit the labor
5:35 market and everyone's crying about bias
5:37 and algorithms and not like hey
5:40 what happened
5:43 in the same way i have economists like
5:47 astronomers or astrologists it's one of
5:49 the two always mix them up they get
5:50 angry over that um
5:53 physicist
5:54 physics people
5:56 there's one who did psychology
5:58 all part of my team the
6:00 theoretical mathematicians too
6:03 all part of the teams i lead these days
6:05 and we all see different problems
6:08 we also see different solutions
6:10 but by screaming and arguing at each
6:13 other
6:14 we find better solutions and the the
6:18 opposite of that is what you see in most
6:20 organizations where the entire data
6:22 science team is just 10 people who
6:24 studied econometrics or 10 people who
6:27 did computer science and there's nothing
6:29 wrong with either study
6:31 but if you do econometrics you're kind
6:33 of stuck as soon as you have to do nlp
6:36 to give you an example
6:38 and it doesn't happen because of the
6:40 interview process let's say the person
6:43 who
6:44 does the interview asks just what they
6:46 know
6:47 right and then
6:49 marketing
6:52 recruitment bottlenecks this process
6:54 like crazy because we only grab the
6:57 specific words
6:58 that we think we need for our team this
7:00 is not a data science problem this is an
7:03 it and the entire labor market y problem
7:05 in that we recruit based on wards not
7:07 actual capability the same reason ton of
7:10 people recruit only recruit data
7:11 engineers these days assuming they also
7:14 have data science capability because
7:16 they previously just recruited everyone
7:18 who said data science and figured out
7:20 then found out they couldn't do the
7:22 engineering part meaning we're now doing
7:24 the same
7:25 faulty mechanism just with another word
7:28 and now we're recruiting a ton of data
7:30 engineers who can't do the data science
7:32 bit
7:34 yeah but how can you find
7:36 we keep depending on vlookup basically
7:40 for our recruitment
7:42 yeah so you mentioned that so you need
7:44 to find what you know that others don't
7:46 know
7:47 and um so since you mentioned that this
7:50 wasn't uh part of the questions i
7:52 prepared but maybe you maybe you can
7:54 help with that
7:55 yeah
7:57 a few days ago i think it was yesterday
7:58 somebody in datadocs club asked this so
8:01 the question is i'm trying to find the
8:03 most complete curriculum for data
8:05 analytics data science and machine
8:06 learning and each site has different
8:08 thing and so on so the question goes on
8:11 to find the the perfect curriculum
8:13 while here you say that hey forget about
8:15 all this stuff right so like if you
8:18 learn deep learning then everyone else
8:20 also knows deep learning right so how do
8:22 you what would you advise to this person
8:24 what would you suggest to this person
8:27 their goal is to find a data role right
8:29 so what would be your suggestion
8:31 striving for perfection is something you
8:33 do
8:35 in academics and in science as soon as
8:37 you step outside of that you realize
8:39 there's no such thing there is no
8:42 perfect model there is only
8:44 good enough now do realize that data
8:46 science is basically three things
8:48 statistics programming and a field you
8:50 applied in
8:52 and add to my great surprise the the the
8:55 field and the statistics i already
8:57 studied
8:59 uh just like a computer scientist has
9:01 programming and
9:02 and statistics math uh activity
9:06 but you start with one of the three and
9:08 then you learn the second one through a
9:10 minor or i don't know and the third you
9:12 just kind of wing
9:14 there is no there is no perfect
9:16 curriculum
9:17 uh just like there is just like there is
9:20 no consensus within science there
9:22 shouldn't be science agrees is a very
9:24 dangerous statement to make
9:26 um in the same way your perfect
9:29 curriculum at the micro level because
9:31 you can't have a local optimum
9:34 very much depends on the field you're
9:36 coming from
9:37 now
9:38 this
9:38 relates to my previous statement of um
9:41 don't double down on the things you
9:43 don't know double down on the things you
9:45 know that give you a competitive
9:47 advantage sure i try i try to improve my
9:50 programming i i will i'll never be as
9:53 good as pi uh a pythonist
9:55 uh as some of the computer scientists in
9:57 my team also because i still prefer r
9:59 i'm sorry um
10:01 but
10:02 that's because i don't try to compete on
10:04 that stuff
10:05 and
10:06 no data scientist except the few
10:09 unicorns
10:10 are complete experts on both programming
10:13 and statistics as well as i don't know
10:16 finance or or outlier detection
10:20 uh whatnot you grab the part you're good
10:23 at and you improve on that because that
10:25 makes you a valuable asset and a
10:27 valuable addition to data science team
10:30 the only alternative is an organization
10:32 where you are the only data scientist
10:34 and you have to do all three which is
10:36 very educational but also makes you lose
10:38 hair and it means you're working for an
10:40 organization that really doesn't
10:42 understand a damn about data science
10:45 because one data scientist is not a data
10:48 science team
10:51 okay so if i summarize don't strive for
10:53 perfection just double down on things
10:56 you know that will give you a
10:58 competitive advantage so for you the
11:00 competitive advantage was your
11:02 social sciences background right so you
11:05 already had some experience with
11:07 i think you mentioned quite a few things
11:08 like election outcome modeling ebola
11:12 finding the discrete district in
11:14 rotterdam with uh
11:16 for example yes
11:21 we we did big time we found some really
11:24 big issues in a model when we were
11:26 predicting um burnouts
11:30 and we had to interview a ton of people
11:31 for that to check if our findings for
11:33 biggest predictors of burnouts were
11:35 actually act were actually valid and
11:37 everyone was like how the hell do we
11:38 interview people and i'm like oh i
11:41 i know i studied i studied this and i
11:43 interviewed a ton of people they were
11:44 mainly criminals but as it turns out
11:46 interviewing people without bars in
11:48 between is basically the same just
11:50 slightly more scary
11:53 once again a thing that i happened to
11:56 know that made me
11:59 a valuable addition to the team as you
12:01 know greeny
12:04 okay
12:05 so uh
12:07 i came across your post on linkedin and
12:10 i reached out to you
12:12 multiple times inviting you for the
12:14 podcast
12:16 and then
12:17 i saw this post and i thought okay this
12:19 is what i want to talk to moran about
12:21 and the post was how to hack your career
12:23 and this is actually the the name of the
12:25 event we have
12:26 and this is the first you wrote how to
12:29 hack your career and then the answer was
12:31 do the opposite of what people tell you
12:33 so can you tell us more about this cost
12:36 that you made and what you exactly mean
12:38 by that
12:39 and maybe you can give also some
12:41 examples
12:44 i think my post started or ended with
12:47 with the quote why try to fit in when
12:49 you were born to stand out
12:51 and as as far as career advice goes and
12:54 this is more than just data science this
12:56 is also if you're i don't know you're a
12:59 florist or you're into accounting okay
13:01 maybe not accounting but you get what i
13:03 mean
13:04 everyone wants to make you fit in it is
13:07 natural behavior of of us uh upright
13:11 monkeys
13:13 to to do the same as the rest does
13:16 but if you want
13:18 to get that job or uh or that assignment
13:22 or that project or want to excel
13:24 if you want to stand out then why the
13:26 hell would you do the same thing as the
13:29 rest
13:30 oh let me guess you're going to try to
13:31 do the rest the same thing as the rest
13:34 who stand out
13:35 that still means you're still mimicking
13:38 other people
13:39 i started out the whole linkedin game a
13:41 few years ago trying to do whatever all
13:43 the popular people were doing more than
13:45 half of it really didn't work because i
13:47 wasn't doing anything authentic i wasn't
13:50 doing any doing anything me
13:52 i was just
13:54 mimicking some other monkeys rather than
13:56 the
13:56 then even other monkeys
13:58 now
13:59 this this goes for your i'm pretty sure
14:02 there's a lot of students here listening
14:04 on in on this in addition to data
14:06 scientists if you're in a team
14:09 and everyone's everyone delegates tasks
14:12 because you know we have hierarchies and
14:14 we have top-down management and everyone
14:16 shits down
14:19 i learned that rather than waiting
14:21 passively to get your assignment and
14:24 your tasks it really helps
14:27 you and them
14:29 to be proactive in that if you are the
14:32 first
14:34 in the room to say no i'll do this you
14:36 pick up the task first you get to choose
14:39 which which task you get to do so not
14:41 the sucky ones so that helps you
14:43 secondly you're standing out
14:46 you're the one
14:47 they'll go to next time because you were
14:49 proactive and that is scary especially
14:51 the very first time when you are
14:54 fresh
14:55 out of college
14:56 in the work floor but it gets easier the
14:59 more you do it
15:00 and i have a i have a story
15:03 about my hair i think you mentioned it
15:04 previously because i am known as the guy
15:06 with you know beautiful hair
15:08 on linkedin as well but one day i i had
15:11 to call the boss i'm not going to
15:13 mention names but i have to mention the
15:15 i had to
15:16 call the bo the boss of the company i
15:19 worked for in the netherlands
15:21 it was a it was an escalation it was an
15:23 it was an important thing and his
15:25 phone number was just in the system but
15:27 you better have a damn good reason to
15:28 call him
15:31 because he'll pick up
15:33 and i said hi this is my guy marcus
15:35 speaking
15:37 and he said who
15:39 and i'm like oh
15:41 crap then i said
15:43 the long-haired guy who talks ai and he
15:46 said oh you
15:47 i wasn't gone
15:50 and that's when i realized that my long
15:52 hair is my trademark it has nothing to
15:55 do with data science ai but it makes me
15:58 stand out now that doesn't mean y'all
16:01 need to grow out your hair
16:02 but it does mean you can own and should
16:06 rock the things that make you unique
16:09 rather than just trying to fit in
16:11 because that never worked for me
16:14 it won't work for you either you can
16:15 spend a whole lot of time money effort
16:18 on being just like everyone else but
16:21 i don't think that makes you happy and i
16:23 don't think that makes them happy unless
16:25 they like really like matching ties or
16:28 something like that
16:30 and that goes for the rest of the the
16:31 linkedin post as well i think it's like
16:34 if if people tell you to wait yeah so
16:36 yeah but maybe about this delegate task
16:38 and uh instead your suggestion is be
16:41 proactive first pick the task which
16:43 gives you an opportunity to to choose
16:45 things
16:46 so it's like okay there is a meeting and
16:48 then somebody says okay we need to do
16:50 this thing and for that thing let's say
16:51 i imagine there is a senior data
16:53 scientist who decomposes the task um the
16:56 product manager says we need to do this
16:58 and then senior data scientists start
17:00 saying okay for this we need to do this
17:02 this and this and you can say ah me me i
17:05 want to do that right like how did how
17:07 does it happen usually
17:09 i
17:09 this also relates to our previous topic
17:11 of the perfect curriculum because
17:13 practice is better
17:15 than any amount of training and because
17:18 i was proactive back in the day my first
17:21 few projects about okay sure i'll do
17:23 that then maybe you can do that
17:26 um half a year later they i was being
17:28 asked about so what management skills do
17:30 you have and i realized
17:32 oh hell i was basically doing the scrum
17:34 master thing over there
17:36 at some point
17:37 because everything is a learning
17:40 opportunity
17:41 working in teams as well and
17:44 this is in part about being proactive
17:46 it's also about picking up opportunities
17:49 to learn
17:50 like
17:51 managing teams like uh distributing uh
17:55 tasks like
17:57 being a product owner being being the
17:58 the go-to person for a specific
18:01 uh topic
18:03 and especially for the young people also
18:05 the old people in the field
18:08 you want to keep learning if you don't
18:10 want to keep learning why the hell are
18:11 you in this field that keeps changing so
18:13 much from year to year and every new
18:16 project that i do
18:17 uh i see as an opportunity to do
18:20 something i haven't done yet that's
18:23 always scary at first
18:25 gets less scary the more you do it um
18:29 but it's a waste of you
18:31 if you don't
18:33 grab that opportunity to learn
18:36 because if you're not
18:37 learning then why are you doing it just
18:39 for the money
18:40 now you should quit your job and become
18:42 an accountant
18:45 though they'll all be automated away in
18:46 20 years i'm pretty sure
18:48 don't be an accountant
18:51 but
18:51 yeah some accountants are very difficult
18:54 to automate i think anyways whatever so
18:57 we already talked about everyone
18:59 delegates tasks then he also mentioned
19:01 being proactive right
19:02 uh what was next on the on the list oh
19:05 you have the list um well there was
19:08 stuff like
19:12 to give a terrible example a lot of the
19:15 a lot of
19:17 projects especially in data science say
19:18 i focus on forecasting because people
19:21 want to know the future let's be honest
19:23 but to know the future you need to know
19:24 the past and
19:26 that's why
19:28 at first with feature engineering you're
19:30 basically usually researching what
19:32 happened in the past and why
19:34 and some of the biggest causes of events
19:37 in the past
19:38 um i'm gonna
19:41 use the burnout model again i found
19:43 a lot of people were having burnouts
19:45 because of a few specific managers
19:48 because you don't quit your body don't
19:50 quit your job quit your manager so we
19:53 found some of the biggest predictors
19:55 were a few set individuals
19:58 and i uh i announced that people said no
20:00 i shouldn't mention that you shouldn't
20:02 mention it i'm like i should mention
20:03 that because if we're gonna try to
20:04 predict who gets a burnout next
20:07 we should we need to explain how the
20:09 model works otherwise they won't trust
20:11 it they won't use it explainable ai is
20:14 actually just all about regression and
20:17 decision trees and ex and explaining how
20:20 your model works and modeling the past
20:21 again i happen to have studied that
20:24 stuff
20:25 to me it was new that you can turn the
20:27 model around and predict the future
20:29 but everyone told me not to mention that
20:31 because then i was in the pres
20:32 presenting to management that those four
20:34 managers were actually causing a lot of
20:36 attrition and a lot of burnouts
20:38 those managers were in the crowd
20:42 so i got my ass kicked on that project
20:45 clearly it it all blew up in my face
20:49 but
20:50 the rest of management was listening
20:52 because i was the only one
20:54 upper management loved it middle
20:55 management hated it because i i
20:59 i made everyone laugh of them pulled
21:00 down their pants
21:02 but because i mentioned that
21:04 later on
21:07 upper management actually acted upon
21:10 those insights because i said would know
21:12 what anybody else dared to say
21:14 now there is a high uh
21:17 chance of being the messenger that gets
21:19 shot in data science because you're the
21:21 first to stumble upon
21:23 bias discrimination all kind a lot of
21:26 stuff you know the amazon recruitment
21:27 case
21:29 um where humans are actually i think
21:31 discriminating but then they trained an
21:33 algorithm to recruit people found it
21:35 grabbed only white males
21:37 then they called the algorithm evil and
21:39 they went back to human recruiting which
21:40 is probably just as biased but it's not
21:42 expressed in data so it's okay
21:45 we encounter a ton of this stuff
21:47 which is fun to me this is why the field
21:50 is fun to me but it's also why the field
21:53 is so valuable
21:55 so if you don't say this stuff you're
21:58 not doing your job right
22:00 you should say it in a careful way like
22:01 no i anonymized that that's what i did a
22:04 few months ago um analyzing a large
22:07 company which which
22:09 which parts of the organization had uh
22:12 pay gaps like gender pay gaps that kind
22:14 of stuff i didn't mention anyone by name
22:16 i just gave them the hashes of oh yeah i
22:19 found out that these these bastards are
22:22 the most uh sexist in in pay gaps okay
22:25 oh that's so bad that's yeah that's
22:26 that's terrible who is it well i don't
22:28 know because i it's all anonymized but
22:30 here is the hashing list so you can look
22:32 it up then they looked it up and they
22:34 got angry at them so then it wasn't me
22:37 the messenger that got shot
22:39 so
22:40 you know you get better at telling this
22:43 stuff in a way that doesn't kill you
22:45 but it is so valuable and so important
22:48 to mention this stuff
22:50 because
22:51 working in a data driven way is still
22:54 new to so many
22:55 companies so many organizations and it's
22:58 it's a fun part
22:59 and it would be a waste
23:02 not to same as it's a waste to keep your
23:05 head down
23:08 okay so i i have a list actually i have
23:10 a post in front of me so one of the
23:13 things you have there is
23:16 instead of getting told not to ask
23:18 questions
23:19 ask anyway was it something you already
23:21 covered
23:22 or not
23:24 oh i was told not to question why
23:27 everyone at certain managers were
23:28 leaving so uh
23:31 so
23:33 you
23:34 should okay
23:36 and yeah the next one or one of the next
23:39 ones be advised by senior with 20 years
23:41 of experience instead
23:43 talk back and advise the senior instead
23:45 we have a story about that
23:48 that's an easy one that's just
23:50 hierarchies you know and pyramid models
23:53 of organizations where the older you are
23:55 the more you know i think it struggles
23:58 with that real badly because there's
23:59 also a ton of people
24:01 who are woefully outdated um in the in
24:05 their knowledge and a lot of them don't
24:07 want to admit it
24:08 but a lot of them also like it when you
24:12 teach
24:12 them stuff it doesn't mean they they
24:15 don't want to learn
24:17 but you also have legions of people who
24:19 just nod and say oh yes yes sir that's
24:21 great we should continue with this
24:23 horrible legacy uh application idea yeah
24:26 landscape yeah sure sure by all means
24:28 it's it's the safest then the entire
24:30 damn thing burns down because it was all
24:31 legacy
24:34 don't tell people they're stupid i
24:37 learned that i do that way too often but
24:39 give them an opportunity to learn
24:42 this is how i became friends with ctos
24:44 of multiple organizations
24:46 it was an accidental reply all mail i'll
24:48 admit this
24:50 i hope you're not listening
24:52 um where he said yeah data science ai
24:55 blah blah and i said well actually no
24:57 you got that and that and that part
24:59 wrong
25:00 it was a reply all mail
25:02 oops
25:03 but it did get me coffee with the with
25:05 the guy in the end
25:09 so what did you talk about over the
25:10 coffee
25:12 well we skipped as slightly skimmed over
25:15 over the fact that he misunderstood some
25:17 some stuff and then we just talked about
25:19 what else uh we were doing because
25:21 a lot of people let's be honest we're
25:23 all nerds here we're we're very much
25:26 interested in the stuff
25:28 people do oh how did you do this how did
25:30 you do that in intakes i am barely ever
25:33 mentioning
25:34 what perfect curriculum i followed or
25:37 what um
25:38 what's what degrees and certifications i
25:40 had i mainly just talked about oh yeah i
25:42 encountered that problem before well how
25:44 did you deal with it well the data
25:46 quality sucked like this and that and i
25:48 fixed it like that and that okay and
25:49 then what yeah then i insulted the
25:51 managers to their face i learned from
25:53 that and then okay
25:54 you're telling stories we all tell
25:56 stories using data because stories and
25:58 experience are so much more valuable
26:01 than pokemon batches
26:04 when what
26:05 than pokemon badges what is that
26:08 never played pokemon come on
26:11 i watched the
26:12 cartoon but not oh man you missed that
26:14 i'm so sorry for you
26:16 like you in pokemon the game you collect
26:18 badges you collect uh certification is
26:21 it a card game or like a video game it's
26:24 a video game never mind i think the
26:26 audience will get it
26:28 comment like and subscribe if you do or
26:31 if you don't
26:32 okay maybe i'm too old for that but i
26:35 think yeah it was like five six years
26:36 ago people were obsessed with you know
26:39 getting pokemons on the street it was
26:40 like some virtual environment virtually
26:42 it was like 15 to 20 years ago but let's
26:44 not go there
26:48 and yeah actually coming back to your
26:51 advice about teaching them stuff instead
26:53 of getting advice from more senior
26:55 people
26:57 when i work with juniors i am always
27:00 like i'm admiring their enthusiasm so
27:02 they come with a fresh look
27:04 they are very enthusiastic they really
27:06 want to learn
27:07 and i don't have that energy right so
27:10 i'm in the company for i don't know well
27:12 almost four years three and a half
27:14 and i don't have a fresh look and this
27:16 is very valuable for me when somebody
27:18 comes to me and says hey like what do
27:20 you have here
27:22 well people might may use different
27:24 words some of them are
27:26 uh
27:27 oh they can say okay this is crap or
27:29 maybe there are other ways of telling
27:31 this but this is really great like when
27:33 people can tell me hey let's try this
27:36 thing and okay this is what i did in my
27:39 master thesis let's say uh this is a
27:41 cool thing how about trying that so and
27:44 it's interaction right like you learn
27:46 from them and they learn from you and
27:47 that is how it should be but we're so
27:51 scared
27:52 i was so scared at the start because
27:55 it's like talking to a professor you
27:56 don't dare to disagree with them well
27:58 it's exactly just like in academics
28:00 actually the professor also likes it
28:02 when you discuss stuff with them
28:05 that's the science in data science come
28:08 on it's research it's disgusting and
28:10 it's trying to prove each other wrong we
28:12 just use a lot of data to do
28:15 okay was there anything else in that
28:18 post i think we covered pretty much
28:19 everything but i am sure you have a
28:21 couple of more stories my favorite last
28:24 one is the the bite off more that you
28:26 can chew than shoe
28:28 because otherwise
28:30 how the hell are you going to learn how
28:33 much you can chew
28:35 i have a poster like that in my
28:37 my house somewhere with a wolf it's
28:39 great
28:41 so
28:42 if i translate it to plain english does
28:45 it mean like okay take as many tasks as
28:47 possible and then figure out that you
28:49 cannot handle them and then
28:51 back off dare to pick up tasks and dare
28:53 to try stuff you will only find
28:56 out what you're good at what you like to
28:58 do two very different things uh where
29:00 the coffee is okay
29:02 um
29:04 buy
29:04 and and where your limits are
29:07 by by
29:08 trying stuff and seeking out those
29:11 limits
29:12 you're not going to do that
29:13 by calmly sitting in the corner and
29:15 waiting for them to give you a vlookup
29:18 task
29:21 and this happens to a lot of data
29:23 analysts as well they get higher
29:24 somewhere and go yeah go do this thing
29:26 in excel or go do this very simplistic
29:28 analysis and the cool ones then go like
29:30 okay i can do that
29:32 we can also run a time series model to
29:34 automate that stuff
29:35 because they don't know that you have
29:37 all the knowledge
29:38 they have the business
29:40 intel blah blah and you're here to teach
29:43 them as much as they are there to teach
29:45 you
29:48 okay i'm looking in the live chat and
29:50 three people said we got it i get it
29:52 probably they refer to this pokemon
29:54 metaphor i'm really wondering what that
29:57 is now i'll after the episode i'll need
29:59 to look it up oh damn i can't see the
30:01 chat is that on on
30:03 it's on youtube yeah
30:06 look it up right now
30:10 three people say that they uh
30:12 they they got it
30:14 while you're looking up
30:16 um
30:17 so
30:18 one thing i know you uh for
30:21 is that you always find these little
30:24 projects little pet projects
30:27 that you do and then you tell the world
30:28 about them and these projects are so
30:30 cool
30:31 can you
30:32 share a few ideas or a few projects you
30:35 did first and then maybe some project
30:36 ideas with the audience
30:38 and yeah maybe not everyone knows you so
30:41 can you tell first about the projects
30:43 you did something awesome
30:45 you probably have something right now do
30:46 you yeah it's loading right now
30:49 so
30:50 i'm going to show you my house
30:52 sort of
30:54 this is home assistant it's around
30:56 running on a raspberry pi 4 in my my in
30:58 my closet i can control my entire house
31:00 through it i'm sorry for those listening
31:03 because you can't see it you see a
31:04 dashboard on my phone with all my lights
31:07 my coffee machine my front door the
31:10 christmas tree is offline as you can see
31:12 because i just kind of disconnected it
31:16 right
31:17 yeah and
31:18 give it a few more months it's it's all
31:20 smart led lights i'm like really proud
31:22 of it you can see it on linkedin it's
31:24 like the the
31:25 my my gas is obviously off right now and
31:29 i'm it's not going on for a few more
31:31 months
31:32 um coffee machine um stereo blah blah
31:35 blah amount of covet cases in the
31:37 netherlands by balcony lights
31:39 more importantly
31:42 these are my plants
31:44 i added sensors to my to my plants to
31:46 give that to check their
31:48 humidity light temperature the poopy
31:52 icon on screen shows if they need
31:54 fertilizer
31:55 i think this one definitely needs
31:57 fertilizer
31:58 um as well as a battery battery icon
32:00 because it's just
32:02 sensors um in the plans broadcasting
32:05 over bluetooth and raspberry pi picks up
32:07 those rights to a database and this
32:09 dashboard then picks up the latest
32:10 numbers and actually gives me audio cues
32:13 my plants scream at me
32:16 when the threshold of all you need to
32:18 water your plants is reached and i
32:20 remember being in a large conversa in a
32:22 big conversation with a big agri firm
32:25 they were like oh well man what can you
32:27 do with sensors and ai and
32:29 everyone was just talking out there
32:31 at their ass about oh yeah census ai iot
32:34 and i just literally pulled this thing
32:36 out of my pants and showed them and they
32:38 were convinced okay my nose knows plant
32:41 thrones
32:43 also this one is tracking the police the
32:45 loca you can't see this this one tracks
32:47 the local police radio to show me where
32:49 the stabbings are in my neighborhood
32:51 also fire so i can go watch
32:54 in case
32:55 you know fun fires are happening near my
32:57 house
32:58 and uh
33:00 yeah that that's stuff i do at home but
33:02 then and here here comes the important
33:04 parts uh everyone
33:06 then i'm talking i'm working and it
33:09 turns out this is valuable experience
33:13 in the same way that i was asked ace
33:15 what do you know about social media
33:16 analysis and i just start talking about
33:18 papers i wrote during my studies
33:22 in 2013 yes i know it's a long time ago
33:25 when i was scraping twitter to research
33:28 a refugee uh crisis uh discus discourse
33:32 and that counts as
33:34 valuable work experience as well in the
33:36 same way hobby projects do so please
33:38 youngsters over there
33:40 don't think you have no work experience
33:43 because you just came out of university
33:45 because all your internships your thesis
33:48 your hobby projects the led lights you
33:50 glued to your piano because i know i do
33:53 they count too
33:56 so what happened
33:58 what did happen to your plants that you
34:00 had to
34:02 to do this system to water them did they
34:04 just die one day and then you thought
34:06 okay how can i make sure that they don't
34:09 die again
34:11 basically because some were over watered
34:13 others were underwater because they all
34:15 have different thresholds
34:18 on the back end it it knows what the
34:20 type of plant is and what threshold is
34:23 so they also scream at me if i over
34:25 watered them but believe me that hap
34:27 occurs less often that's a rare event
34:31 so you have some sensors in each plant
34:34 right so these sensors send data over
34:36 bluetooth to raspberry pi in your closet
34:39 right yeah the raspberry pi
34:42 stores it because they scream their
34:44 their their new data refresh it every
34:46 minute it stores the latest values and i
34:48 can connect to that and trigger events
34:50 happen if if thresholds are reached
34:53 and the app you showed is it i don't
34:55 know like do you write i get a i get a
34:56 question in the audience are you not
34:58 worried about cyber attacks
35:00 i'm not worried about them cyber
35:02 attacking my plans because the sensors
35:04 only send data they can't kill my plans
35:06 through it
35:07 and the rest the rest of it all runs
35:09 zigbee so it's all localized it's not
35:12 wi-fi it's not bluetooth and it all runs
35:14 through iceland so i'm pretty secure on
35:16 that end like really if you're building
35:18 iot go with sigbi way safer
35:21 that's a long trip like from the plant
35:23 to iceland and then to your computer
35:26 um all the all the internet connections
35:29 like the ones i just showed goes through
35:31 iceland yes
35:32 okay through a vpn uh somebody asked
35:35 does my cat complain of course the cat
35:36 complains cat complains about everything
35:38 mainly food which is the one thing i
35:40 haven't automated yet
35:43 yeah next project right
35:45 phone color
35:47 yeah so
35:48 what about red lights so you said you
35:50 put some red lights on your piano
35:53 oh no i'm still working on that i put
35:55 smart led lights uh on my piano um now
35:59 i'm working on the microphone that still
36:01 isn't running so that when i play the
36:03 lights move
36:04 based on the the tune and rhythm
36:08 yeah i imagine somebody might be
36:11 well it's a great project it's an
36:13 amusing project but somebody might be
36:15 thinking okay this is fun but this is
36:16 not serious how can i talk about
36:19 this to a potential employer oh well
36:22 easy example i soldered some wires to my
36:24 coffee machine so i can remote control
36:26 it so i don't have to walk over every
36:28 time but as it turns out as i can now
36:31 monitor my coffee views through the
36:33 smart plug that measures the the power
36:35 usage and me pushing the button i write
36:37 that away to a
36:39 to a database and then suddenly after
36:41 two months i had data to run a time
36:43 series model on my coffee addiction
36:47 that's cool suddenly i have experience
36:49 in time series modeling i think the
36:51 thing is currently offline i'm so sorry
36:53 my clearly my coffee consumption got
36:56 messed up ever since we're going back to
36:57 the office so sad total trend breach um
37:02 but suddenly i have stuff that i can
37:04 show
37:05 and it counts
37:06 more than the next guy oh i did the
37:10 training on that
37:13 yeah
37:14 this is a question i get quite often so
37:16 how do you get inspiration for these
37:19 projects because i imagine it might be
37:21 difficult so let's say you are looking
37:23 for a job because you're switching
37:25 career or you just graduated or for
37:27 whatever reason you want to
37:29 have a portfolio right and then the
37:30 question is how do i build this
37:32 portfolio okay you can go to kaggle you
37:34 can pick a competition you can do
37:37 you can take part in this competition
37:38 then you can train a model and then
37:40 maybe if you're lucky you get in with a
37:43 silver medal and then you put in your
37:45 city but so do
37:47 the rest of the people there right but
37:49 don't get me wrong i highly respect the
37:52 kaggle grand masters who can optimize
37:54 the heck out of stuff i don't i can't do
37:57 that to that extent but that brings me
37:59 back to my original statement why fit in
38:02 when you were born to stand out because
38:04 it it takes so much effort to be the top
38:07 0.5 percent
38:10 who beats all the rest in the same
38:12 kaggle competition it's much easier to
38:15 create your own competition like i did
38:17 with my coffee machine how did i get the
38:19 idea because i'm lazy because i didn't
38:22 want in between meetings to walk to my
38:24 kitchen and back just to turn it on and
38:27 then walk again one minute later
38:30 it is pure unaltered laziness
38:34 that is the main force behind automation
38:37 in the modern world and makes for really
38:40 good developers
38:41 laziness that got me to build that stuff
38:43 also sheer curiosity to see if it would
38:46 work
38:47 but what about other let's say air
38:50 quotes more serious projects because you
38:51 mentioned
38:52 stabbing in
38:54 in rotterdam and other things and i know
38:56 i remember the story you told me the
38:58 other day about helping farmers in india
39:02 oh yeah i do some ngo projects because i
39:05 yes
39:06 way back
39:07 tell us about that so how do you find
39:10 projects that are let's say
39:12 um
39:14 not related to the plants in europe
39:16 but i think this is a broader data
39:18 science thing in that you shouldn't do
39:21 [Music]
39:22  build what they ask but you
39:23 should build and do what
39:26 organizations need many of you will join
39:29 organizations and like yeah we need
39:31 something with data we need something
39:32 with ai
39:34 um but you're there to solve problems
39:36 and help them make better decisions
39:38 there's a reason why google calls it
39:40 chief decision data
39:42 chief decision
39:44 scientist these days
39:46 um
39:47 if you're just building what they ask
39:49 which is usually excel double plus stuff
39:52 you are not probably applying all the
39:55 ideas all the knowledge all this all the
39:57 skills
39:58 you have which brings me back to the be
40:00 proactive part
40:03 and suggests stuff
40:05 this is a important part of being a this
40:07 is why they call me a consultant because
40:09 i come in there
40:10 because of my expertise
40:13 but
40:14 most data scientists are consultants
40:17 within their own organization because
40:19 they're the guy or girl who knows that
40:21 stuff that the rest doesn't
40:25 yeah so can you tell us about this uh
40:27 helping farmers uh yeah sorry
40:30 um to go to get back to that it's uh
40:32 it's an ngo uh
40:34 two three ngos we're working with in
40:36 india and kenya
40:38 they ate smallholder farmers in
40:41 developing countries
40:44 help them achieve higher yields because
40:47 between 30 to 50 percent depending on
40:49 your math of the food in the world is
40:52 produced by smallholder farmers
40:54 according to to u.n statistics
40:56 um
40:58 so if you want to help world hunger and
41:00 holy moly we're going to get a we're
41:02 getting going to get another world
41:04 hunger crisis this summer
41:07 you need to help the smallholder farmers
41:08 produce more so we give them advice
41:11 on how to achieve better yields
41:14 um what their yield will be end of
41:15 season also how they can apply crop
41:17 rotation planting what would actually
41:20 increa
41:21 uh give them the highest earning and
41:23 stuff
41:24 um use we use weather satellite uh
41:27 imagery all kinds of uh feeds for that
41:29 i'm hopefully going to india in two
41:32 months to to help out over there to
41:33 speak to locals to interview them to
41:36 figure out what they use what they don't
41:38 use
41:39 um
41:41 because here we have part of the ask
41:43 like what is my youth going to be end of
41:45 season i would like a forecast
41:47 but the optimization part they are not
41:50 asking for but we are going to provide
41:52 that anyway because if we're building
41:54 building a prediction model we will see
41:56 what are the biggest biggest predictors
41:58 for you and we can advise you on that we
41:59 can talk to you about that some of those
42:02 predictors they can't change like you
42:03 live in this part of the west bengal
42:06 region it's that fertile over there so
42:08 that's the yield you're going to get
42:10 some other things like what they plant
42:12 when they planted how they planted
42:14 i am by no means a farming expert i have
42:17 you know sensors to keep my own plants
42:19 alive
42:20 but this is stuff that they do not ask
42:24 but that is of immense value to them
42:26 when you give it to them and that again
42:29 is data science and also
42:31 my niche in the fuel i guess
42:34 everyone screams about explainable ai
42:36 but i think there's a very small
42:38 threshold between explainable ai and
42:40 just
42:41 using statistics and models to explain
42:44 what the hell is happening to help
42:46 people make better decisions and i do
42:48 that for my job
42:50 i do that a lot of dutch and
42:52 international organizations and i also
42:54 want
42:55 to help
42:56 smallholder farmers
42:58 and god knows where
43:00 because it's the same damn thing
43:02 just different data
43:04 and like 15 different ways of spelling
43:06 cow down
43:07 yeah and if you if you're not an expert
43:10 in farming or whatever other domain
43:12 whatever other field
43:14 and there are some things that experts
43:16 domain experts people who are let's say
43:18 your customers
43:20 they don't ask for something
43:22 how do you know
43:24 that they are going to need this if you
43:25 are not an expert in that yourself i
43:28 don't arrive
43:29 alexi this
43:31 refers to her earlier topic you don't
43:33 need to know everything
43:34 because i'm part of a team i'm i'm
43:36 bragging about it but i'm just one of uh
43:39 five glorious bastards who who work on
43:41 this project and we all have different
43:43 skills that one knows much more about
43:46 farming that one can make power points i
43:48 never could um
43:50 and it's collaborating with people who
43:53 know a lot of stuff that you don't know
43:55 that gives you an opportunity to learn
43:58 if you're stuck in uni like i was stuck
44:00 in uni surrounded with people who know
44:02 the same stuff you will feel
44:05 well very inadequate because they know
44:07 more about your specific field
44:10 but here i'm working with a guy who
44:13 actually was a farmer years ago
44:15 a lot of tractor jokes i swear um
44:20 but he can advise me and us on that
44:22 stuff in ways i can't so i don't need
44:25 stress out over knowing everything
44:29 because we work in a team for that i
44:31 just stress out over knowing the things
44:34 i should do
44:36 and believe me that's stress enough
44:38 yeah
44:39 i was thinking you would say something
44:41 about you know you need to ask questions
44:43 and
44:44 you know really
44:46 not grill experts but
44:48 ask them a lot of questions try to
44:50 really understand the domain but having
44:52 a domain expert in a team i think it's
44:54 easier right you need to you need to
44:56 main you of course you should ask all
44:57 the questions because
44:59 people explain the problem but they
45:00 usually don't explain the problem behind
45:02 the problem forget what i mean
45:05 so this guy
45:07 with tractor jokes and farming
45:09 experience this is why he got the job
45:11 because of his farming experience
45:14 like was it a way he's got quite a lot
45:16 of other skills uh as well
45:19 but it does make him stand out
45:23 and that is exactly what you want you
45:26 you can stand out with your hair or you
45:28 can stand out with having experience and
45:30 knowledge that nobody else does
45:33 and
45:34 again my team i have this guy who who
45:36 studied aerospace god knows what but he
45:40 knows everything about boeing's and it's
45:42 really interesting during lunch to hear
45:44 everything about airplanes
45:46 um but as soon as we're talking i don't
45:48 know
45:49 logistics optimization and it defaults
45:52 airplanes he's the guy we go to
45:55 because he knows airplanes
45:58 and other thing we talked about uh with
46:00 you just a couple of days ago and they
46:02 all
46:03 you mentioned already that there might
46:05 be
46:06 again a problem with famine and hunger
46:09 in the
46:10 next months right and i think it's
46:12 related to war in ukraine right
46:15 and this is something we talked about
46:17 recently and one of the things you
46:19 mentioned is that as a data scientist
46:21 you can do what you called open source
46:24 intelligence
46:25 right can you talk about that a bit and
46:28 about also the hunger
46:30 sure so let me start out but open source
46:33 intelligence also known as osint is the
46:36 field of
46:38 grabbing social media data stuff that's
46:40 open that's out there and using it as
46:44 valuable data to do stuff
46:46 i was already doing that 10 years ago
46:48 really in
46:50 when i was studying to grab twitter data
46:53 to predict which or analyze which parts
46:57 of the netherlands would and wouldn't be
46:59 open to receiving uh
47:01 uh refugees
47:02 and the war in ukraine
47:05 is the first modern information war on
47:08 earth it is incredibly interesting what
47:11 we're seeing over there history is being
47:13 written
47:14 um i'll skip all the doom scrolling
47:16 because i just spent three months just
47:18 doom scrolling but just yesterday did
47:21 you see the deep fake of president
47:22 zielinski being posted you shared it i
47:25 try not to spend too much time on uh
47:28 that's a smart move that's a very smart
47:30 move but this is the first time in
47:32 history that people use deep fakes to
47:35 impersonate a president to spread fake
47:38 news and it's not just putin dancing and
47:41 and singing abba no it's actually is
47:44 a serious misinformation campaign based
47:46 on machine learning techniques now back
47:49 to osint
47:51 um
47:53 first few days ukraine was using intel
47:56 gps intel uh based on russian soldiers
47:59 who took their phones along
48:01 to figure out where the soldiers are and
48:03 to you know send drones and bombs after
48:05 them which is
48:07 terrifying and horrifying because this
48:08 is war and i do i i condone the violence
48:12 that kind of stuff
48:14 um but simultaneously
48:17 it is so interesting to see two modern
48:19 states
48:21 with modern technology at war we've
48:23 never seen that before um
48:26 syria iraq afghanistan palestine is it's
48:29 all horrifying what's happening over
48:31 there don't get me wrong and i i i hope
48:34 we could we get more
48:36 sympathy for those people and their
48:38 plight thanks to ukraine
48:40 um but the
48:41 the images we got from there was usually
48:44 night vision goggles
48:46 uh of people really zoomed out with
48:49 turbans so to say now we have high
48:51 quality imagery hitting the internet 24
48:55 7.
48:56 um
48:58 and we have a huge social media response
48:59 to that
49:00 we also have people going on tinder like
49:04 i was last week i was ivanka
49:07 and i was using a gps spoof to pretend
49:09 to be on the ukraine border
49:11 and i was matching with people in
49:13 russian uniforms
49:15 and we were all just reporting
49:18 our location and the
49:20 amount the amount of miles the distance
49:22 to to that person we matched with
49:25 because somebody else also matched it
49:26 matched with ivan
49:28 but was over there and that way you can
49:30 triangulate that the the russian soldier
49:34 who you are tindering with
49:36 on which part of the russian ukraine
49:38 border because that's where they're
49:39 stationed which part they are and thus
49:41 we can on scale analyze where the
49:44 reinforcements are on the border and the
49:46 ukraine government actually uses this
49:48 information it's
49:49 absolutely crazy and i haven't even
49:51 started about an anonymous uh and using
49:54 ddos attacks to take down uh
49:57 well um
49:58 russian news
50:00 for one which was also really
50:01 interesting because then um
50:04 russia as a country started blocking
50:06 foreign ip addresses so you couldn't do
50:08 ddos attacks like that anymore
50:11 and yet a few hours later the ddos
50:14 attacks continued because they were
50:16 coming from within russia
50:18 itself
50:20 and
50:21 this is all open information that we're
50:24 using for very violent purposes
50:29 but it's never happened before
50:31 and it makes our field as data
50:33 scientists
50:35 uh relevant in in ways that it has never
50:38 before been relevant and i i think that
50:41 will that will only increase in the
50:43 future
50:45 if somebody wants to help with these
50:47 efforts with ocean and other things
50:50 how can they do this
50:52 google is your best friend because
50:54 there's so many uh task forces uh you
50:57 have anonymous obviously um people on
50:59 reddit uh
51:01 especially unfortunately especially
51:03 reddit
51:04 um
51:06 compiling lists though the whole tinder
51:08 is a reddit thing i'll admit this
51:11 um just gathering gathering data there's
51:13 tons of open maps
51:15 um where we aggregate twitter reports of
51:19 and sightings of oh hey here here bombs
51:22 are falling oh we saw we saw tanks
51:24 driving over there
51:25 um i help out sometimes with that as
51:27 well in the evening
51:29 of just pinpointing those tweets because
51:31 there's no gps because ukraine
51:34 government asks the population please
51:36 turn off your gps because that's
51:38 that's a way to target you
51:40 um but these reports are coming in and
51:42 we're mapping those pinpointing them on
51:43 maps to see
51:45 movement of troops and also all the war
51:48 crimes being reported that's going
51:49 straight to the hague they're going to
51:50 use this data that we collect on
51:54 tinder and twitter these days
51:56 they're going to use that in court
51:58 in x months time that that is that is
52:01 that's big
52:03 that's all data and that's all data
52:05 that's out there that we can use and
52:07 it's
52:07 it's free for the picking really
52:10 to make matters worse we knew basically
52:12 knew this was coming for half a year
52:13 because for half a year people have been
52:15 tracking the fact that there were tons
52:17 of military trains everywhere in russia
52:20 going towards the border that was mapped
52:22 we knew all the tanks that were
52:25 that that data was also present
52:28 nobody wanted to believe it would happen
52:31 i didn't want to believe it would happen
52:32 either i i have friends on both sides
52:35 for the record and i i pray for
52:38 their safety
52:40 um
52:41 but historically these are these are um
52:43 this has never this is unique
52:46 never before and that brings me to the
52:49 the last part and that's the the famine
52:51 because that's why i'm also working on a
52:53 few projects uh
52:55 for that did you know that the ukraine
52:56 flag the blue and the the yellow is
52:59 actually grain
53:01 it's the blues blue sky and the yellow
53:03 that's the golden grain because it's the
53:05 bread basket of
53:07 uh of the world so we're gonna see huge
53:10 well decreases in grain produce over the
53:12 next year which will lead to higher
53:14 grain prices but also a higher meat
53:16 prices worldwide because a lot of that
53:18 grain is actually used to feed animals
53:23 not only that but that's one of the
53:24 parts right then also
53:27 energy and
53:29 like many other things
53:30 oh yeah a lot of things
53:33 yeah
53:35 okay
53:36 and
53:37 i don't know if i should change topic or
53:40 not because we have some questions and
53:42 one question from mike you don't see
53:44 probably this question because this
53:45 question is from slido which is uh
53:48 other thing
53:49 so mike is asking should data experts
53:52 learn soft skills like
53:53 people skills communication networking
53:56 drinking as well as hard skills to go
53:58 further and faster
54:00 oh it goes both ways whatever makes you
54:03 unique what makes you a better
54:05 i don't mean you should paint your hair
54:07 purple by the way but whatever makes you
54:09 stand out and gives you an edge
54:12 works even if it's
54:14 being the one who can also talk to to
54:17 the to the people the one who is not
54:18 afraid to stand on stage i did opera as
54:21 a kid
54:22 that is why i can talk about it like
54:24 this i'm pretty sure because when you
54:26 when you
54:27 sing italian for 500 people in pants
54:30 that are way too tight you can do it you
54:33 can tell 500 people and
54:37 yeah don giovanni um but the point here
54:40 is doesn't mean it all has to be social
54:42 skills you can also excel because
54:45 i don't know uh it's all in azure and
54:47 then this client suddenly wants aws
54:49 you're the only one who also worked with
54:51 aws
54:52 that works too
54:55 just don't be the same as everyone else
54:58 would you want to be i know a guy who
55:00 did esports for a few years
55:03 and thanks to that he excelled at at his
55:06 project because
55:07 they they were mining i don't know
55:09 league of legends or some date and
55:11 he happened to have played it in the
55:13 past so he was like the expert
55:17 but usually when you look at job
55:19 postings they require you know there is
55:22 a certain profile they require and this
55:24 is like a description of an average data
55:27 scientist with three to five years of
55:29 experience and this is who the company
55:32 want usually
55:33 right yeah those are means and averages
55:35 and stuff and we as data people
55:38 should know how
55:40 horrif horrible averages and means are
55:43 you know the average person
55:46 has one boob and half a wiener
55:49 think about that
55:53 so
55:54 um well maybe to summarize dude a way to
55:57 stand out is uh just yeah take what you
56:00 know and double down of that right i
56:02 think this is something you said at the
56:03 beginning
56:04 and
56:06 let me check if we have other
56:08 questions
56:10 um in live chat do you see anything so
56:12 there was a comment about um like oh
56:15 yeah i i i the tinder sample got uh
56:18 yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry like
56:21 ivanka was like a really bad name i had
56:22 to come up with something
56:26 yeah it's not a typical name i think at
56:28 least not in russia in ukraine no i was
56:31 using all to translate and pretending to
56:33 be uh
56:34 an exchange student didn't really work
56:36 that well
56:37 um i i think even though my dad never
56:40 gave me much advice in the world of data
56:42 because you
56:43 really doesn't get it
56:45 he did give me dating advice which is
56:47 don't pretend to be someone you're not
56:50 and career-wise it's exactly the same
56:53 don't try to don't pretend to be someone
56:56 you're not at least it's not in the long
56:58 term because
56:59 that doesn't help you
57:01 and that doesn't help him hurt or your
57:03 clients or your boss i don't know
57:07 okay but also your father gave
57:09 your
57:11 if i'm not wrong your father told you
57:13 that
57:14 social sciences is not really
57:16 like a way to go right you don't get a
57:18 job with that turns out turns out you do
57:21 but
57:23 that's just
57:24 because his data his experiences of the
57:27 past
57:28 told them that
57:29 yeah right
57:31 well we still have time for one more
57:33 question maybe and this is something i
57:35 wanted to ask you
57:36 so one question about linkedin i see
57:39 that you're pretty active there
57:41 and
57:42 you have quite a few followers so what
57:44 is your
57:45 growth strategy there is it about
57:47 posting cats and memes or
57:50 linkedin is an algorithm same as any
57:52 other it's the nearest neighbor style
57:53 matching algorithm i believe
57:55 um you can optimize that
57:58 uh open secret i think you should post
58:00 on thursdays and tuesdays at between
58:03 eight and nine in the morning your time
58:05 um because there's an optimal time there
58:07 to post there's an optimal amount of
58:09 hashtags and people uh to tag in your
58:12 post the type of material you uh you
58:14 post you trend a lot less if it's an
58:16 animated video
58:19 um if it's without a picture it's
58:21 circulated even more um
58:23 there is a ton of stuff you can do to
58:26 optimize your post to get a bigger reach
58:29 i may or may not have done the same for
58:32 dating apps in the past but now this
58:34 scratches my itch you know um
58:37 and if you optimize it
58:40 i can i could do a whole lecture on how
58:42 to optimize uh linkedin you will get a
58:45 bigger reach and that is fun in itself i
58:48 am basically trying different things and
58:50 for the first year or so it was terrible
58:52 because i was just
58:54 trying to reverse engineer what works
58:56 and what doesn't work and for me that is
58:58 try to post on weekdays between nine uh
59:01 eight and nine in the morning because
59:02 your post will basically circulate for
59:04 one hour
59:06 and after that if it doesn't reach a
59:08 required amount of links uh likes or
59:11 comments it will stop trending comments
59:14 are much more stronger than likes if you
59:16 want to support a post comment because
59:18 linkedin is a comment driven algorithm
59:20 not a like driven algorithm
59:22 um
59:23 if it requires reaches the threshold of
59:26 amount of
59:27 attention then it will circulate for
59:29 like 12 hours and this is why i need to
59:31 post early in the in the work days
59:33 because then you will get have the
59:35 morning everyone checks their phone
59:37 while they're on the loo or having a
59:39 coffee
59:40 um meaning you optimize your odds of
59:43 getting liked in that first crucial hour
59:46 and then you'll also be trending over
59:48 lunch and dinner
59:49 if you post three at night
59:52 very few people are gonna like it unless
59:54 you have a lot of australian friends
59:57 and then there's the content thing which
59:59 is like there's three types of posts on
1:00:01 linkedin which is bragging information
1:00:03 and humor
1:00:05 and i remember
1:00:08 um our big marketing manager um
1:00:12 from a company i shall not mention going
1:00:13 like hey my hand posted any memes
1:00:15 recently even though i trend harder than
1:00:18 his entire marketing department
1:00:21 because most people and organizations
1:00:24 just post bragging stuff like oh yeah i
1:00:27 have this certification or i got this
1:00:28 promotion and posting about your
1:00:29 promotions is great that's good but
1:00:32 people like that because they know you
1:00:34 they don't care about the information or
1:00:36 the humor in there
1:00:37 but if you want to post every week every
1:00:39 month or every day
1:00:41 you can't just brag about yourself
1:00:43 unless you're like apple and you only uh
1:00:46 post bags but nobody likes that then
1:00:49 they only people from the same
1:00:51 organization like your and nobody
1:00:53 else does
1:00:54 um
1:00:55 but if you post information that's
1:00:57 actually informing to people with humor
1:01:00 you can post about that every day and
1:01:02 that's basically what i do i almo okay
1:01:05 sometimes i brag but i try not to post
1:01:07 dragon posts but just information about
1:01:10 my field about my experiences about
1:01:12 things i learned about the things i did
1:01:13 wrong especially very funny usually
1:01:17 humor about me screwing up like with the
1:01:19 managers and and burnouts like i
1:01:21 mentioned just now that makes for great
1:01:23 posting material and i have that every
1:01:25 week
1:01:26 so if i inform people people like that
1:01:29 because bragging they will only like if
1:01:31 they know you or your organization
1:01:33 but if they
1:01:35 if it's informing and relevant to your
1:01:37 field people outside your organization
1:01:40 and outside of your
1:01:42 field of connections will also like it i
1:01:44 have more followers and people as you
1:01:47 should you can analyze this i have more
1:01:49 people liking my stuff from accenture
1:01:51 and kpmg then from my own damn company
1:01:54 are you listening to me capgemini
1:01:56 like my more
