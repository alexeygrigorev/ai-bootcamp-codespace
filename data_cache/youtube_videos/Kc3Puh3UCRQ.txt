1:01 questions that we prepared for you
1:04 [Music]
1:04 um
1:06 and
1:08 I think I'm ready are you ready yeah I'm
1:11 good
1:12 okay so let's start
1:14 this week we'll talk about self studying
1:16 and continuous learning in machine
1:18 learning and bioinformatics we have a
1:20 special guest today Aisha Aisha is a
1:22 self-taught bioinformatician machine
1:24 learning engineer and data scientist
1:26 from Johannesburg
1:27 Johannesburg South Africa
1:30 she gradated from machine learning Zoom
1:32 camp that we have here in data talks
1:34 club and she studied Python and
1:37 basically developed development
1:39 and she maintains the local and
1:41 bioinformatics and machine learning
1:42 topics Beyond touch is interested in
1:44 many other things such as photography
1:46 and digital art so maybe if you saw the
1:49 picture we have for the cover today like
1:53 there is this spice mushroom spicy
1:56 mushroom and this is what we talked
1:57 about so this is something Asia true so
2:00 welcome to our interview today
2:03 glad to be able to speak on the podcast
2:06 and thank you for having me
2:08 yeah the questions for today's interview
2:10 were prepared by Johanna Byer thanks
2:12 Johanna as always for your help you are
2:14 very helpful in preparing all these
2:16 questions and let's start so before we
2:19 go into our main topic of self-study and
2:22 continuous learning in machine learning
2:23 bioinformatics let's start with yeah our
2:26 background can you tell us about your
2:28 career Journey so far
2:29 yeah
2:31 um my career journey I would say is like
2:34 just beginning still considering like
2:36 I'm basically a student I've just uh
2:38 I've been mostly um doing my studies up
2:40 there now but like um I started studying
2:42 python
2:44 um quite a few years ago I don't
2:47 remember how old I was I think I was
2:48 like 12 or something or 11 maybe
2:51 um and I've been started I did like
2:53 introductory Python and then I did like
2:54 JavaScript and HTML and CSS like the
2:57 standard I want to do coding what do I
2:59 do package
3:01 um and then I discovered like data
3:03 science and bioinformatics and I was
3:05 like okay this is like a cool field to
3:06 go into and I started studying that and
3:09 I was also studying like biology and
3:11 chemistry and like the more sciencey
3:13 fields and um then recently I started
3:16 going into more machine learning and
3:18 like actually focusing on trying to
3:19 build my career in machine learning so
3:22 that is like my goal now is to like
3:24 establish myself in machine learning and
3:26 still be able to like do my
3:28 bioinformatics along with it if there's
3:31 like some way I can merge these two
3:34 different fields I've been doing
3:36 and then the scientific illustration is
3:38 something I only like pursue on the side
3:40 maybe as like a second field or
3:43 something like that
3:45 scientific illustration what is that
3:48 um scientific illustration is like there
3:51 are different types of scientific
3:52 illustration like the uh you might I'm
3:54 not sure if you've seen those where they
3:56 make like infographics or like
3:58 animations or stuff explaining like
4:00 scientific Concepts New York Times well
4:02 New York Times is different maybe there
4:04 are not so many and not so much
4:06 scientific
4:08 I've seen there are like um scientific
4:10 illustrations published in New York
4:12 Times as well so that's like one of them
4:13 and um then also like just general
4:16 making
4:17 um art to explain science basically is
4:19 how I describe it's like explaining
4:21 science through ART and like uh visually
4:23 engaging appealing manner for like
4:25 people maybe who are not so much into
4:28 sand so just have like a general
4:29 interest in science like explaining all
4:32 the D jargonifying signs and explaining
4:35 like a easy nice manner is what I would
4:37 consider scientific illustration or art
4:39 as a whole
4:41 I think we had a podcast episode
4:45 um maybe over a year ago or something
4:46 like that it was with me or
4:49 um and we talked about visualizing
4:51 machine learning and we spent most of
4:54 the time on that interview discussing
4:56 how exactly more comes with
4:58 uh his visualizations
5:01 um like how he goes from a concept to
5:04 like an illustration What is the process
5:06 so probably it's related yeah it's like
5:10 a similar thing
5:12 okay and then you set you studied python
5:16 you started studying python like 12
5:17 years ago or sometimes like that quite
5:19 some time ago and then it wasn't that
5:22 long ago I was like 12 myself I was 12
5:24 years old
5:26 ah ah 12 months ago not 12. no no like
5:30 it wasn't 12 months ago I was 12 years
5:33 ago when I started studying python I
5:35 think it was like five or six years ago
5:38 see I see so you're not like uh you're
5:41 what I'm trying to ask here is you're
5:44 not taking these classes as any part of
5:47 any formal education right so you're
5:49 just going there on the internet finding
5:52 things there to study and you just study
5:54 them right or how does it work like how
5:56 do you learn all these things
5:58 all right uh so I would
6:01 I would have internet and just start
6:02 studying things like um I I try I'm a I
6:05 try not to be like randomly pursuing
6:07 everything I find interesting it's not
6:08 formal education right yeah yeah it's
6:11 all study yeah like I'm doing this at
6:13 University
6:14 I'm being homeschooled so I haven't gone
6:16 to any formal education technically I
6:18 now went to school I've not gone to UNI
6:20 I like technically if I was going in
6:23 school I would be going to UNI now so
6:26 I'm not going to UNI I've not been to
6:28 any school so like I everything I know
6:30 I've either like my mom used to teach me
6:32 before that or I've still studied so I'm
6:34 either homeschooled or self-taught
6:36 interesting I don't think I ever spoke
6:39 to anyone who was homeschooled so how
6:42 how did it feel
6:51 it's good because I've like literally
6:53 never gone to school so
6:55 but it would be your mother or like just
6:59 teaching you some stuff and then
7:00 eventually maybe it was just you
7:03 know things yeah like obviously when I
7:05 was a kid then it was like my parents
7:07 thought I would like teach for like with
7:09 study whatever and like we never like
7:12 followed a curriculum or something so I
7:14 was like um I whatever at that point
7:16 like that's why I started studying
7:18 programming or scientific stuff much
7:20 earlier I think that I would have gotten
7:22 to at school because like I I found it
7:25 interesting so that my mom would like
7:26 gather resources and let me just learn
7:28 it and teach me or whatever and then
7:31 after that once I was old enough I just
7:33 started studying by myself online with
7:35 online resources and stuff so
7:38 interesting yeah well when my kid is
7:42 sick and we need to do some
7:43 homeschooling too I just never have
7:46 patience to actually sit with you and
7:49 explain all the stuff so your parents
7:52 must be very patient people yes my
7:55 parents put up with a lot of stuff yeah
7:58 that's cool well I guess you have more
8:00 flexibility this way right so like yes
8:04 yeah
8:05 um even even not like I'm not like even
8:07 if traveling stuff just in what I'm
8:09 studying there's like so much more
8:10 flexibility than in school where okay
8:12 you're studying one thing and then like
8:14 you're gonna study everything you want
8:16 maybe at school because you have to
8:18 follow the school system and this way I
8:21 can like study things I I can pick and
8:23 choose what I want to study like if
8:25 there's something I already know then I
8:26 don't know if like go through again and
8:28 like I would have to in school
8:29 curriculum
8:31 mm-hmm
8:32 yeah because what I wanted to ask you
8:34 next or the question with prepared is
8:36 what motivated you to take this approach
8:38 and I guess you kind of answered it
8:40 already because
8:41 you have been doing self studying since
8:45 forever rights since yeah since school
8:48 days yeah
8:49 so maybe what is interesting is how do
8:52 you decide to learn what exactly like
8:54 there are so many things on the internet
8:56 right so you open any I don't know data
8:59 science subreddit or I don't know any
9:01 data science community and then you're
9:03 immediately bombarded with all these
9:05 links all these new things and then you
9:07 feel okay um like I have to study all
9:09 that and if I don't they have this uh I
9:12 feel I have this fear of missing out so
9:15 how do you approach this systematically
9:16 how do you not go crazy when
9:19 so
9:22 um as a general like topic like okay I
9:25 want to study I don't know
9:26 bioinformatics or whatever
9:28 um that I I think I started following it
9:30 like out of Interest a bit more because
9:33 I always wanted to do like the cool
9:35 scientific research and stuff
9:38 um but that hasn't always been possible
9:40 to like pursue that pass so then I
9:42 discovered that like there's something
9:44 more realistic within my reach that I
9:46 can do with like Tech stuff and online
9:49 and with the resources I have available
9:51 and it's sort of like I still get to do
9:54 the cool sciency stuff but it's like
9:56 practical because I can do it so that is
9:59 how I began studying it and I I maybe
10:03 um finding resources
10:07 um I don't know I I've always like maybe
10:09 I did waste a bit too much time doing
10:11 like introductory python courses because
10:14 I was like okay well I did this course
10:15 and I did that course and then like I
10:18 faffed around for a while but then
10:20 um it I think I've just gotten good at
10:22 like finding the good resources because
10:25 like you get you get the hang of it
10:26 after like doing it for a while of
10:28 finding out that these are like the best
10:30 resources and then it helped that like I
10:33 had like a sort of guideline in my mind
10:35 of what I need to know so I need to know
10:37 like this much of biology or chemistry
10:39 or whatever and my python skills need to
10:41 be at this level and then for
10:43 bioinformatics specifically I found this
10:45 a really cool pathway
10:47 um made by the open source Society
10:49 University where they make like these
10:52 tracks and stuff so then I followed that
10:54 and I think generally like filtering out
10:57 information is a skill
11:02 I think we're lost here
11:07 or at least I don't hear you anymore
11:18 one two one two
11:21 I think I'm still Audible actually I
11:24 think we lost your sound
11:31 yeah no pressure
11:47 I think guys all hear something again
12:15 so I just make this glitching this is
12:17 what you're about me
12:18 so she should be back soon hopefully
12:24 interesting testing
12:25 yep works
12:27 okay you got me now
12:29 yes
12:31 okay sorry about that
12:33 I don't remember what you were talking
12:35 about when it stopped well you were
12:37 talking about different tracks uh that
12:39 there is this uh there are some open
12:41 curricula online and like you found some
12:45 tracks for bioinformatics and this is
12:47 what you studied yeah
12:49 um but I'll say like in general in
12:51 finding resources I think um spending a
12:54 lot of time online helps with that
12:56 because like you can start curating the
12:58 resources that you find and they're like
12:59 okay this is covering this skill set and
13:02 maybe this is not what I need right now
13:04 and it might be cool but maybe I can
13:07 just at some later point and not now
13:09 or if you can find like communities
13:12 where people have gathered resources
13:13 like okay to achieve this certain skill
13:15 set this is what you need to learn and
13:17 then you can either follow those
13:19 specific resources or you can find like
13:21 alternate resources but I think majorly
13:23 what has helped is having a like idea in
13:26 my mind of what skills I need so like if
13:29 I want to pursue machine learning I need
13:32 like a basic introductory look at
13:34 machine learning and that's why I did
13:35 the zoom Gap in the first place was
13:37 because I was like okay this seems like
13:39 a good resource to get my basic Stone
13:41 and then once I know a bit more about
13:43 the field then I can decide that okay
13:45 what skills do I need to develop further
13:47 yeah I have so many questions based on
13:50 what you just said so there are so many
13:53 interesting directions so first of all
13:56 you said that
13:57 you developed a Feeling
13:59 you know when you look at the resource
14:01 you know that it's good and they wonder
14:03 how does it work like how do you know
14:05 let's say you look at the zoom Camp of
14:07 course maybe this is a very good example
14:11 of course I mean let's not take a zoom
14:14 come like you take a resource right so
14:16 how do you know it's if it's good like
14:18 how do you understand that
14:22 so um I've like there are a few things I
14:25 look at the first are like skimmed the
14:26 syllabus or whatever and see if the
14:29 content that they're teaching is
14:30 something that I need right now if it's
14:32 like applicable to me right now so like
14:34 obviously if I'm there's so much cool
14:36 stuff that I want to learn and I'm like
14:38 okay maybe knowing exactly how stars
14:41 explode in space is not something you
14:42 know right now so obviously that's
14:44 something I just like throw out the
14:46 window there but then say I pick up like
14:48 a course on machine learning and I will
14:52 see that okay the syllabus is good it's
14:54 teaching me how to use a framework that
14:56 I need to know right now so then I'll
14:58 like watch like the introductory videos
15:00 and see that okay does it feel like this
15:02 course is offering quality does it look
15:04 like something that is being got in a
15:06 good way does it look like the people
15:08 know what they're talking about or am I
15:10 gonna get ripped off here like that kind
15:12 of thing like just gorging the general
15:14 quality of it like if you were to pick
15:16 up a book and you'd flip a few pages
15:19 around read a bit and you see like okay
15:21 does this look like something that is
15:23 quality or does it look like somebody I
15:25 don't know just wrote a bunch of stuff
15:27 that they don't know what they're
15:28 talking about and published it
15:30 because obviously on the Internet it's
15:32 like that YouTube stereotype where the
15:34 people on YouTube who don't know what
15:35 they're talking about but there are lots
15:37 of there's so much good resources on
15:39 YouTube as well but like you use you can
15:41 get an idea for how much the person
15:43 knows what they're talking about how
15:46 beneficial it might be if you like skim
15:48 through it a bit and like just
15:50 pick out bits and pieces and like listen
15:52 to them or whatever and then you can
15:54 decide that okay this up till now this
15:56 looks like something that's good and
15:57 then you can like commit to studying it
15:59 and then see how it is
16:02 you mainly look at free resources or you
16:04 also consider paid courses
16:07 um I try and go for free where possible
16:09 obviously because like it's more
16:12 affordable uh but if it if it's like
16:14 good resources then I'm not like averse
16:17 to investing in it because like okay
16:19 this is something that will benefit me
16:20 or my career down the lane then okay
16:22 it's a worthwhile investment but I will
16:25 make sure that if I'm investing
16:27 something it is quality and it is worth
16:29 it it's not like I would try to avoid
16:32 investing in something where I can learn
16:34 with the free resource resources even if
16:36 it's like a hardware study or whatever
16:39 because scheming a paid course might be
16:42 more difficult right because you don't
16:44 have access to the course usually yeah
16:47 maybe some parts but you don't usually
16:50 get the access to the course to know if
16:52 it's good or not
16:54 for a paid resource I'd go more like
16:56 okay who's the author who published it
16:58 is there any free content that they've
17:00 put out or somewhere where I can like
17:02 get a general idea for their sort of
17:05 content elsewhere like aside from this
17:07 one paid course so you can like get a
17:09 general profiling of who is teaching the
17:12 course before you like pay for it
17:13 they're like get me see if it's credible
17:15 or not see their credentials what work
17:17 they've done that kind of things
17:20 then finally that you mentioned this um
17:24 information about how stars explode
17:26 because this is what I was just reading
17:28 the other day that's pretty cool stuff
17:30 and quite interesting oh yeah but maybe
17:33 like in this example if you study
17:35 machine learning then obviously
17:37 astronomy is not super relevant to that
17:39 at least most of astronomy right
17:42 so this is kind of a no-brainer right so
17:44 if you want to learn about linear
17:46 regression you know that how stars
17:48 explode it's not gonna help you yeah but
17:52 when it comes to machine learning there
17:54 are many things like for example when I
17:56 was studying machine learning I thought
17:57 that support Vector machines are super
17:59 important to understand and also because
18:02 I was taking the machine learning class
18:04 at the University and that at the
18:06 university the teacher was one of the
18:09 like he was doing a lot of research and
18:11 support technicians so I thought that
18:13 it's very important to really understand
18:14 these things well but when I started
18:16 working I understood that nobody really
18:18 cares about them yeah because machines
18:20 are not really useful anymore
18:22 so how do you
18:24 understand that like how do you
18:26 understand these things that okay
18:28 astronomy is not relevant but when it
18:30 comes to machine learning there are some
18:31 topics that are perhaps more relevant
18:33 some are less relevant so how do you
18:35 understand which direction to go I think
18:38 this one I this one is just something
18:40 like you do it and then realize okay it
18:42 wasn't that needed like I spent a lot of
18:45 time doing a data science
18:47 um course and that had a lot of like
18:48 data visualization and I also had like
18:51 data cleaning and everything and at that
18:53 point I was like okay maybe this is not
18:55 the direction I want to go in so it's
18:56 not that important as what I was like I
18:59 was doing it for machine learning or
19:01 data science more so seeing how the data
19:04 is cleaner or maybe good knowledge to
19:06 have but maybe not as relevant as what I
19:08 wanted to do then so okay I did it and
19:11 maybe it would come in handy later but
19:12 at the time it was not what I was
19:14 looking for so I think that's just
19:16 something you have to like you figure
19:18 out after the fact that you studied that
19:20 okay this is not something as relevant
19:22 like because there's no way you'd know
19:24 that without studying okay so I thought
19:27 maybe you'll just tell me okay do that
19:29 that and then you'll know what is it no
19:32 unless I'm not maybe somebody can figure
19:34 out some spells then please share with
19:36 me
19:37 well I guess in this case Community is
19:41 helpful right so because you can always
19:42 ask people and like you could I think
19:46 like to some degree maybe it is you can
19:48 like get an idea by doing your own
19:50 research or like figure finding people
19:52 more in the field and like getting their
19:54 if they have done like interviews or
19:56 question answers whatever you could like
19:57 ask them or communities could be helpful
20:00 but I think to some degree it's
20:02 unavoidable that you end up studying
20:04 something and they're like okay maybe it
20:05 wasn't that important
20:10 yeah
20:11 sorry I interrupted you
20:13 no
20:16 um I I just wanted to say that while
20:18 doing my masters and also my bachelor I
20:21 also studied a lot of stuff that is not
20:22 relevant so maybe if I was doing
20:25 self-study
20:26 instead
20:28 then things would have
20:30 been different right yeah maybe I would
20:33 have actually spent more time on
20:35 studying things that are relevant not
20:36 because teachers thought so what did you
20:39 think of everyone and like
20:40 um there was somebody who mentioned that
20:42 they were studying computer science and
20:43 they said that for the first two years
20:45 of the curriculum they don't touch
20:46 computer science at all and they must
20:48 learn English and maths and chemistry so
20:51 like it's it's funny how the school
20:53 system works like why must you study
20:54 chemistry in your University when you're
20:57 majoring for computer science like okay
20:59 that's one thing to have a basic
21:01 knowledge of it and it's one thing that
21:03 you're studying it in University when
21:05 you're trying to study computer science
21:06 whereas if you're like you could just
21:08 focus on computer science and learn
21:10 whatever is necessary and if there are
21:13 any gaps in your knowledge you can also
21:14 go back and study later it's not like if
21:16 you didn't study chemistry your first
21:18 year but then you needed in your fourth
21:19 year it's the end of the world
21:21 yeah indeed well I did not have that
21:25 when I was studying computer science
21:26 well we had obviously it would also
21:29 depend on like where you start but like
21:31 I'm just giving an example we did have
21:33 chemistry but later like on third grade
21:35 which is not very clear why I mean I had
21:38 fun I like chemistry at school and then
21:40 at University I also kind of enjoyed it
21:43 but it's not something I really need to
21:45 know yeah apart from having pleasure in
21:49 studying this yeah there's no other
21:51 applications
21:54 yeah but we did spend a lot of time
21:56 studying math and
21:57 while fun like I enjoyed like solving
22:01 all these equations and all these things
22:04 like a game at my work as a data
22:07 scientist yeah most of these things
22:09 aren't really needed so yeah it's like
22:11 one thing that um you have you study
22:14 something because you find it
22:15 interesting or you want to go into like
22:16 a research field or something so you
22:18 studied it but I think in like a
22:20 day-to-day application you're you're
22:22 hardly going to need a lot of this kind
22:25 of stuff and if you need it again you
22:27 can just like say you wanna you sit
22:29 you're joining your pursuing a career
22:32 path and you're like okay this is needed
22:34 so you can study it then instead of like
22:36 wasting all of your time studying it
22:38 where you could be building up a main
22:39 skill instead
22:42 yeah and how do you approach this how do
22:45 you approach learning do you focus on
22:47 building projects you focus on learning
22:50 theory first or how does it work for you
22:52 in general
22:53 um
22:55 I like I think a balance of both is
22:58 needed
22:59 um because obviously without make
23:00 building projects it's like there's
23:02 always that aspect to just Theory which
23:04 is lacking because like you could know
23:06 something very well in theory but in
23:08 practice it you're like your knowledge
23:10 will end up falling short you run into
23:12 issues which you wouldn't have known in
23:14 how to solve with just the theory
23:16 but um I think also learning new things
23:20 in the theory is important like building
23:21 new skills or advancing your skill set
23:24 especially in something like Tech like
23:26 if you were to build more projects in
23:28 like a particular field but then you're
23:31 not learning new skills and then at some
23:33 point you're gonna be like okay these
23:35 skills that I have are outdated and I
23:37 spend all of my time building a bunch of
23:38 projects with a skill that's now falling
23:40 out of the market
23:42 and like I like learning more by
23:45 building projects as well as like I like
23:47 reading and stuff so I'll just read a
23:50 bunch about things and then I'll go and
23:52 try to build a project and I'm like okay
23:53 I did half of the things I learned
23:55 weren't needed and half of the things I
23:57 needed to build the project I didn't
23:58 know so then you hit the Google
24:01 so I think like a balance of both is a
24:04 good way to go so like you you're
24:05 covered on both fronts
24:08 yeah I'm a big fan of uh the projects
24:12 approach and then I think I neglect
24:13 theory on them if it's not the ideal
24:17 case maybe yeah like it should be a
24:19 balance like you said yeah well to some
24:22 other projects always a bit more
24:23 interesting because you've like got
24:24 problem solving or whatever so I think
24:26 that that the projects have a bigger
24:28 appeal at some point
24:30 look but I'm wondering for you how do
24:32 you decide what to build
24:34 like if you want to build a project then
24:37 you probably there is a skill you want
24:38 to master and then
24:40 how do you decide that
24:42 to master the skill I want to build this
24:44 project that should do this this and
24:46 that how does it work well
24:49 um
24:49 I don't know I just I I
24:52 think of ideas first and I'm like okay
24:54 this would be a good way to use these
24:56 skills like
24:58 um I like I like surfing I like just
25:01 surfing on the internet and finding like
25:02 for for the data and stuff I like just
25:04 finding cool data and okay what can I do
25:07 with this data because I want to use
25:09 this data because the data is
25:10 interesting and I'm like okay maybe this
25:12 would be something I want to like I
25:14 don't know get better at pandas or
25:16 something as a random example and I'm
25:18 like okay I could use this data to build
25:20 something with this framework I'm like
25:23 okay let's just do it like there isn't a
25:26 lot of reasoning behind my project
25:27 sometimes Beyond it's cool let's do it
25:31 so I like going on those um data set
25:33 searches and just typing keywords which
25:36 I'm interested in and then just seeing
25:37 what comes up and picking random stuff
25:39 that is cool
25:40 okay let's say if you're interested in
25:42 astronomy and exploding Stars you can go
25:45 to kaggle or whatever data set yeah
25:47 website and then you can just look for
25:50 astronomical stuff and then okay there's
25:52 an interesting data set let's see what
25:54 they can we can do with it yeah like um
25:57 I'll another way I found of finding good
25:59 idea is like you know they publish the
26:01 research papers on random stuff on like
26:03 on science scientific stuff and a lot of
26:06 them they publish the data with it so
26:08 it's not very clean data a lot of the
26:10 time because not like meant to be used
26:11 for data stuff but if you like clean up
26:13 the data it is you can make like it's a
26:16 cool way of finding data that's like
26:18 linked to like a study or something and
26:20 then you can see like okay what else can
26:22 be done with this data can I like make
26:24 something cool using this data in a
26:26 different way maybe
26:30 I like just go into like studies that I
26:33 read because I like I like reading
26:35 scientific papers just for the fun of it
26:37 so then I've bookmarked the studies
26:39 which are cool and then just see what I
26:40 can do with the data in my free time
26:43 how do you find this Peppers Peppers
26:45 that you want to read
26:48 um mostly it's like I just if I have
26:49 like some sort of question like I was
26:51 wondering like
26:53 um I don't know I'm falling short on
26:55 examples but like I spent a lot of time
26:57 reading about horse color genetics
26:58 because I was like okay so if the horses
27:00 have this colors and how does their
27:02 color genetics work and then I was like
27:04 okay so how does the human and human
27:06 pigmentation work and I just fall in
27:08 like a Google revitor until I find cool
27:11 research papers about it
27:13 yeah
27:15 I don't typically do this every day but
27:17 I remember when I Was preparing for my
27:19 master thesis when I was writing it and
27:22 of course I needed to do some
27:25 research to understand what was done
27:27 before that before my work what's I can
27:32 baste my my work on I found the Google
27:35 Scholar very useful yeah
27:40 yeah I I use Google Scholar but often I
27:44 just go on like the main Google and I
27:46 just search and like there's like the
27:48 they just put like research article or
27:49 article as a keyword and then you can
27:52 get like um there's like PubMed
27:54 um nature articles
27:57 um quite a few I'm forgetting the names
27:58 now but like there are quite a few which
28:00 are like free Publications that allow
28:02 you to read the entire things without
28:04 paying for it
28:05 foreign
28:07 it's good for like when I'm just sitting
28:10 free and I like I just end up spending
28:12 like hours on Google wasting my time
28:14 reading absolutely random stuff but
28:17 sometimes the data can come from which
28:19 is useful
28:20 yeah I remember one of the most useful
28:23 feature of Google Scholar was this
28:24 citation graph
28:26 you know which what are the impactful
28:29 papers that this particular paper cites
28:32 yeah so that you can kind of go back
28:34 yeah it happens and you can also see
28:36 what paper cited this paper so you can
28:38 yeah exactly then you have like it's
28:41 you have this both directions right you
28:43 can go to the past and see what was done
28:44 before and then yeah what kind of work
28:46 was based on this paper yeah and then
28:49 I remember also spending a lot of time
28:52 on that but I kind of had to
28:55 to do this because I needed to
28:58 like one of the chapters in my thesis
29:00 was state of the art uh research I mean
29:04 so that was a part of the thesis
29:07 but I can understand how fun it could be
29:10 like when you have a topic that you're
29:12 interested in and just yeah explore
29:16 and uh yeah I'm really curious now to
29:20 talk about your experience with our
29:22 course machine learning Zoom Camp
29:24 how did you find it uh like why did it
29:28 attract you why did you decide that this
29:30 is actually a good course
29:32 um mostly because it was fast like it
29:35 was like four months so it's brief
29:37 because like I don't I I get bored so I
29:39 didn't want to do sometimes very long
29:40 I'm like okay four months it's fine I
29:42 can do it and also it mentioned like
29:45 three it's a lot of time four months is
29:47 a lot of time many things can happen in
29:49 four months yeah but it's like not it's
29:51 not like a huge long one year long
29:53 you've got to study for one year
29:55 sophomore year
29:56 yeah
29:57 like I'm already studying my balance
29:59 projects has been going on for like
30:01 three or four years so I wanted
30:02 something that's not going on for that
30:03 long I wanted something like okay just
30:05 quick be quick about it don't spend
30:06 years and I thought that was like a good
30:09 way to like break into machine learning
30:11 like it's uh it's gonna offer me like a
30:14 good comprehensive look at the different
30:16 aspects of it
30:17 um this I got from like reading your
30:19 guys syllabus and everything and then I
30:21 also saw that I mentioned three projects
30:22 and like weekly small projects so I
30:25 thought maybe it's more project oriented
30:27 so that'll be fun because I didn't want
30:28 to like do too much Theory so mainly the
30:30 things that was like okay it's not that
30:32 long and it has projects so I was like
30:34 okay let's give this a try it should be
30:36 interesting
30:38 remember where you found it like on
30:40 Reddit or on social media somewhere
30:43 um first my mom mentioned it to me I'm
30:46 not sure where she found it I think she
30:47 follows the uh vodka the music or
30:51 something and then I saw it and then I
30:53 saw it after that on LinkedIn so I was
30:55 like okay I'm gonna check this out
30:58 is your mom listening to us talking
31:00 right now I'm not sure she might be okay
31:04 well tell her hi
31:08 anyways how we were talking about
31:10 projects right and since you mentioned
31:13 uh and this is what I wanted to talk to
31:15 you about too so in Zoom camp we have
31:16 these three projects and I wanted to
31:19 talk to you like to understand how
31:20 exactly
31:22 you approached your approach what was
31:25 your approach when it come when it came
31:27 to selecting projects uh how did you
31:29 decide what to do there like was it also
31:31 the data set first approach or how did
31:34 you go about that yeah I thought
31:38 second like the first Capstone project
31:40 that I was doing
31:41 during the castle competition for the
31:43 kitchenware thingy
31:45 um and then I ran out of time to build a
31:47 separate one for the Capstone so I used
31:49 the same project in both places
31:52 um but the first project I did like the
31:54 midterm was about predicting the
31:56 toxicity of frogs based on their color
32:00 um so initially I was gonna make
32:02 something I was like wanting to find
32:04 something cool because I didn't want to
32:06 do like the economic or political the
32:08 like property and price data because
32:11 that was boring I don't want to do it
32:13 um so I think I went I don't remember
32:15 there was like one website either was a
32:17 Google data set search or some other
32:19 website and I just like searched like
32:22 poison or something like that I
32:24 initially when I do like I want to do
32:26 like um the most toxic poisons or
32:28 something like that but then I found
32:30 this one where they um they did an
32:32 entire study
32:33 about how a species of Frog's color
32:35 indicates its toxicity like its
32:37 brightness and everything so I was like
32:39 okay well what if I make a model that
32:41 can if you input the data it can predict
32:43 the um species of the Frog instead and
32:46 how like it's toxicity
32:48 so that's what I built then so I built a
32:51 model that like it takes the values
32:54 um the values had to be given in like
32:55 the accurate form that the study
32:57 measured them in so it wasn't like
32:59 practical probably but then I would just
33:01 predict how jock said that frog species
33:03 would be
33:04 so I just went on like data set search
33:06 in Google
33:07 and then I think the next one I did was
33:09 like a landscape recognition so that
33:11 also I just like okay I went on Gekko I
33:13 wanted for that one I wanted to do
33:15 something with like the image um
33:17 recognition so I just went on Gekko and
33:19 I went open the image recognition data
33:21 sets and I saw like a landscape
33:23 classifier and I didn't have too much
33:24 time uh that time around so I just
33:26 picked like a easier one and went for
33:29 the landscape classifier
33:31 see well this one about frog toxicity is
33:35 really interesting so I guess this is
33:36 one of the things that were interesting
33:39 for you back then right and then we
33:41 decided to find something yeah actually
33:44 I wasn't even looking for anything to do
33:45 with frogs I was looking for something
33:47 that was poison because like I've been
33:48 reading about poison recently and I was
33:50 like okay this is cool let's do
33:51 something poisonous and then I saw the
33:53 frog one and then I did my research I
33:55 read the research papers and then I went
33:56 to another about that fish is a frog and
33:58 I was like okay this is way cooler we're
34:00 doing this
34:02 I kind of want to ask you more about
34:04 like how did you even
34:07 come across you know this poison topic
34:10 why because art of self studying I guess
34:14 you you said you spent a lot of time
34:16 just doing random stuff on the internet
34:18 reading things so I'm really curious
34:20 like how exactly it happened did you
34:22 even realize that okay now you're all of
34:25 a sudden interested in uh poisons no I
34:29 honestly didn't I keep I keep like
34:31 finding random things that are
34:32 interesting and then I just spend a lot
34:34 of time Googling them until I'm bored
34:36 with them and then I never think about
34:37 them again so poison is just one of
34:39 those that's like okay this is
34:40 interesting let's read about it but then
34:42 like it's not like a lasting interest
34:44 yeah let's see do you somehow structure
34:47 all these things like all these topics
34:50 uh I don't know poison then uh call like
34:54 you said horse genetics and all the
34:56 other things
34:58 I gotta just you keep everything in your
35:00 mind like in your uh in your brain how
35:04 does it work yeah that these are mostly
35:06 just like I'm free I have free gems so
35:08 like I just do random stuff but none of
35:10 these are like structures just like okay
35:11 whatever interest in it at the moment I
35:13 might go and read about it it's it's
35:15 like if I have free time or if I like
35:18 can push my time around then I'll just
35:20 squeeze them in anywhere I can but it's
35:21 not like something I like dedicate time
35:24 to reading about or anything they're
35:25 like very unstructured
35:27 okay so you I don't know wake up with
35:30 your breakfast and then you have some
35:31 free time and then okay what I'm going
35:33 to read about today uh let's read about
35:36 frog poison it's more like I've been
35:39 thinking about this for the past one
35:41 week so I'm still really about it and
35:42 I'm like okay well next topic check on
35:44 board of frogs okay now let's read about
35:47 horse genetics right yeah
35:51 is it related to your interest in
35:54 bioinformatics in any way
35:56 um bioinformatics is more born from my
35:59 general like I was at that time very
36:01 much obsessed I wanted to be a
36:02 researcher at any rate I don't want to
36:04 be anymore but like at that point I was
36:06 like biology and chemistry research is
36:09 all I ever want to do in life and then
36:11 obviously that was not possible at the
36:12 time because like I waited I didn't have
36:14 the resources I were able to like pursue
36:16 that and that's probably a good thing
36:18 because now I'm not so sure if I want to
36:20 do that but then at that point I was
36:21 like okay what else can I do that is
36:23 related to this and then I discovered
36:25 that Byron ferment into this entire
36:26 field which is like the closest I can
36:29 come to combining what I can do and what
36:32 at the time I really wanted to do
36:34 so I was like okay this is like a nice
36:36 mesh of my like Obsession at the time
36:39 and what I can actually do and then I
36:41 was like okay well I really want to do
36:43 this like long term so bioinformatics
36:46 was like like one of the things I just
36:48 kind of stuck around one of these
36:49 obsessions that just stuck around
36:54 and I'm really curious about
36:57 like so for example you said you wanted
36:59 to do research and then you started but
37:03 then you realized you don't want to do
37:04 research but how do you
37:07 stay motivated when learning by yourself
37:09 because I imagine
37:11 for me at least I quite often need an ex
37:15 like external push coming from somewhere
37:17 to when I'm not motivated to actually
37:20 keep learning because if I don't do this
37:23 then I just
37:25 I don't know
37:26 not do anything
37:29 so how do you
37:31 keep yourself motivated when you learn
37:33 by yourself and you don't have this
37:34 external push then all your motivation
37:36 is coming from from you like how do you
37:39 do this
37:41 um
37:42 what's that not really sure I think
37:46 I work better
37:47 a deadline so when I'm like not
37:50 demotivated I just set up like okay I
37:53 have to finish this at this point so
37:55 then I know like okay there's a
37:56 difference yourself
37:57 I set the deadline myself here I think
38:00 to some degree being homeschooled might
38:01 have helped with this like I've never
38:03 had much of an external factor to like
38:05 keep me going so just being like okay
38:07 well you got to do this at some point so
38:09 just like pick a date and then that that
38:11 date cannot move so even if I have to
38:14 stay up till like 2 A.M I have to finish
38:16 it because of the deadline so it's like
38:18 okay I just set my deadlines and then I
38:20 try to plan them as best as I can and
38:22 unless like something very big came up
38:24 but the deadlines do not move so if I've
38:26 been lazy one week I can't say okay I'm
38:28 gonna push the deadline one week because
38:30 I didn't do anything I'll just have to
38:31 do it then so I think that's that though
38:34 like oh goodness the deadline's almost
38:36 here is my motivation
38:40 yeah that's a lot of that requires a lot
38:42 of discipline because if you set the
38:43 lines yourself then yeah
38:46 yeah like
38:48 that
38:50 that's really cool like uh and when you
38:55 you have a deadline and you know okay I
38:57 have to do this
38:59 but then since this deadline is not
39:01 kind of real
39:03 I'm still
39:04 trying to understand like probably
39:06 wouldn't work for me maybe I don't know
39:08 I don't know I mean I I think
39:11 I think some point you it's like I'll
39:13 write my deadlines and I'll I have
39:16 I have computer like a digital one
39:18 obviously and I just like bright in big
39:20 bold that and to the point where it
39:22 annoys me and like I cannot remove it
39:24 until I've finished it so it's mostly
39:26 just like bullying my brain and you're
39:27 like okay you just have to do this now
39:29 stop being lazy it's like I will I'm not
39:31 like I don't I don't think I'm very
39:32 organized with my time I should be
39:34 better at it so sometimes I like will
39:37 waste an entire week doing nothing much
39:39 but then I'm like okay well let's not
39:42 let's not mess up this one deadline
39:44 let's just stop messing around and do
39:46 the work so I think once that's ups and
39:48 downs like I get back I Won't Say I'm
39:50 the most organized or most uh very
39:53 self-disciplined person but like it
39:55 works for me so it's fine it I get the
39:57 work done eventually so it also helps
40:00 that I like switch between a lot of
40:01 different things so if I'm bored of one
40:03 thing and I'm sick of doing it then I
40:05 can just switch the next thing I like
40:07 run things in parallel so I can like I
40:09 have an escape like okay I'm sick and
40:11 tired of doing data science let's go
40:13 illustrate something instead
40:16 see yeah that's cool mushroom is the
40:19 mushroom is really cool
40:22 but yeah
40:25 I
40:28 I'm just curious
40:30 so I forgot what I wanted to ask so let
40:33 me just uh
40:34 um yeah it was about Zoom Camp so
40:37 in the zoom camp in Machinery Zoom camp
40:39 we had some deadlines I guess for you it
40:41 was helpful right so that's the
40:43 deadlines were external
40:45 yeah
40:47 yeah well at least for me that would be
40:49 much much more helpful than the
40:50 deadlines I would set for myself to my
40:53 yeah the deadlines were helpful like um
40:55 at some point I was ignoring the midterm
40:58 project because I didn't want to do it I
41:00 was bored and I was like studying other
41:02 stuff and then it was like I think it I
41:04 only begin it like in the second week I
41:06 was like oh yeah I should do this now
41:08 because I'm a runoff game and I did run
41:10 off them because I got stuck and then I
41:12 finished it I think I submitted it like
41:14 the Sunday before after I'd been where I
41:16 like I got up early this Sunday and I'm
41:18 sitting working on the project that
41:19 entire Sunday and like I was like okay
41:22 maybe I shouldn't have ignored this for
41:23 all of the first week but like having
41:25 the dead and I was like okay I gotta get
41:26 this done like I might have skipped on
41:28 it otherwise but like I was okay I gotta
41:30 like I want to stay on the leaderboard I
41:32 can't skip this project
41:35 and then while you were procrastinating
41:38 you were reading procrastinating I mean
41:40 taken some time off the course you can
41:43 call it procrastination it's fine
41:45 you were probably about poison and
41:48 toxicity of frogs right no I think
41:51 yeah
41:53 remember I I was like convincing my
41:55 brain that this is
41:57 this is the wrong kind of
41:59 work
42:01 and in general how do you
42:05 well you said that you use the sticky
42:07 notes to
42:08 I think you said bully your brain into
42:11 yes doing stuff but when it comes to
42:15 actually studying like taking notes and
42:19 keeping your projects organized
42:21 organized do you have any system
42:27 no I don't take notes because I forget
42:30 to read them and I forget to pay
42:32 attention if I'm making notes so notes
42:34 are like I never do something they never
42:36 help me so if I do get if I like forget
42:38 things I just re-watch it or Google it
42:40 instead because notes have never worked
42:42 for me and
42:44 um as far as like time tracking
42:46 YouTubers and stuff go no I don't use
42:47 them it's just like okay I have the
42:49 deadline but before the deadline I just
42:51 mess around and do whatever as soon as
42:52 the work gets done by the deadline I
42:54 don't care what my daily schedule looks
42:56 like it's like some days I will do a
42:58 bunch of stuff in the day and then some
43:00 days I just do one thing in the day like
43:01 focus on one thing so it's like whatever
43:03 my mood is for that day whatever I'm up
43:06 doing
43:08 but I don't really use like any
43:10 structural tools or anything
43:12 cool
43:13 yeah that's interesting that he
43:14 mentioned us because for me notes is the
43:17 only thing that actually works if I want
43:19 to read any information so it's funny
43:21 how
43:22 everyone is different right yeah like I
43:25 try taking notes because everyone's like
43:27 notes are your key to success and if you
43:29 don't take notes you never like learn
43:30 properly so I was like okay well I gotta
43:32 take notes now and I couldn't I would
43:35 forget to pay attention or I'm listening
43:36 so that I end up like listening to the
43:38 entire lecture and I heard not a word
43:40 and I would forget Adam anyway I
43:43 wouldn't ever read my notes I would
43:44 forget what the notes mean so notes just
43:47 never worked for me
43:50 are there any drawbacks for stealth
43:52 studying so let's say we compare a zoom
43:56 Camp which where deadlines are let's say
43:59 external they are forced Onto You versus
44:04 self-style in when you find material
44:06 online and you take this if you learn it
44:09 at your own pace so what are the some of
44:13 the drawbacks in this approach when it's
44:15 completely self-studying completely
44:17 based on your own motivation and
44:18 discipline
44:20 um um I think one of the drawbacks could
44:23 be the same motivation discipline thing
44:25 that's like it's easier to not fulfill
44:28 deadlines when you are the one setting
44:29 them and nobody else is like responsible
44:32 for them and also I think it can be a
44:36 bit harder to make sure you are learning
44:39 the correct things on your own like you
44:41 could end up wasting time or resources
44:43 studying something that is down the line
44:45 you're like okay I shouldn't have done
44:47 that whereas if you're following a
44:49 course or like a system somebody else
44:51 made you're like okay these are people
44:53 in the industry obviously they know what
44:54 is more beneficial to study at a given
44:57 time so like they're having the
44:59 resources compiled is obviously a lot
45:01 easier and maybe to some degree more
45:04 efficient like there's a higher chance
45:06 of making a mistake when you're doing
45:08 yourself because before you study and
45:10 you don't know anything about that thing
45:12 and then afterwards you can be like okay
45:14 well hindsight 2020 I shouldn't have
45:16 done that
45:17 but um
45:19 obviously at this point because I am
45:21 doing all the self-study I think its
45:23 benefits outweigh this like the freedom
45:26 you get and the how much more it works
45:28 for me personally but obviously it may
45:31 not be for everybody and like there are
45:32 these things which are maybe better in
45:35 like following a structural structured
45:37 study program
45:40 you find do you find study groups
45:42 helpful for you or you prefer doing
45:45 things yourself yeah I prefer doing
45:46 things myself I don't like study groups
45:48 I don't like um I'm not very much a
45:51 social person I don't like doing things
45:52 with others I'm fine on my own but I
45:55 know for others they're like vastly
45:57 helpful like lots of people have said
45:58 that study groups give them the
46:00 motivation and stuff to self-study so I
46:02 think for people who are of that like uh
46:06 personality it would be very helpful for
46:08 them maybe but personally I don't like
46:10 them or maybe other things that study
46:13 groups help with is the deadlines so you
46:17 as a group is that on the deadlines and
46:18 then you walk through a course even if
46:20 this course is a self-paced course then
46:22 it kind of work is a like in a small
46:24 cohort sort of like yeah yeah
46:28 like I know I've never seen any appeal
46:30 in that myself because that's just not
46:32 like how I like studying but I assume
46:34 for people who like the social part
46:37 there'd be they'd be a lot more
46:38 motivated even with like multiple people
46:40 doing it or something
46:43 and then I think at the beginning you
46:45 set one of the goals you have is to
46:47 break into machine learning
46:49 yeah so having this goal does it help
46:52 you to actually focus on studying and
46:54 selecting which kind of material you
46:56 want to uh focus on and things like that
46:59 yeah definitely
47:05 how the industry works I'm trying to
47:07 find that what type of opportunities are
47:09 open in machine learning because now I'm
47:10 like serious okay I want to do machine
47:12 learning whereas previously at most I've
47:14 had like a passing interest in machine
47:15 learning like okay it's cool but I don't
47:17 know if I'm doing it or no so I never
47:19 paid as much attention to it whereas now
47:21 I'm like okay I need to seriously do
47:22 this so I should find resources I should
47:24 try and make connections in the machine
47:25 learning world I must try and get my
47:29 name out there
47:36 F1 call for some reasons
47:41 and my phone will die so
47:45 because I lost
47:47 um live chat anyways
47:50 yeah um
47:54 and uh
47:56 yeah somebody keeps calling me so
48:04 I'm just
48:05 wondering what else to ask you because
48:08 now I got distracted
48:10 um
48:11 baby Zoom camp
48:13 [Music]
48:14 um
48:17 were two kind of parts so there was a
48:20 data science part or focused on machine
48:22 learning theory and then there was more
48:25 practical data machine learning
48:26 engineering part which one did you like
48:28 more
48:30 um
48:31 I don't know I kind of like both
48:33 um I didn't have like any particular
48:35 preference either way I I didn't much
48:38 like the ammo up like the cloud part
48:40 with like the kubernetes and Docker
48:42 because I don't like that no I don't
48:44 like it as much it's like I don't wanna
48:46 I don't want to focus on the ml Ops part
48:48 like obviously I know it's necessary if
48:50 you're going in this journal but like I
48:52 preferred the working with Gold without
48:54 any worry how to get it running in
48:56 deployment but it wasn't I like the way
49:00 it was handled in the zoom Camp um I
49:02 actually thought it was a lot more
49:03 difficult from like what I had seen
49:04 briefly out of the zoom camp but then
49:07 okay this is maybe not so bad like after
49:10 I'd done it but like before especially
49:12 before like we reached those modules I
49:14 was like oh goodness we have to do like
49:15 Docker because I was like I was very
49:17 much daunted by the fact that Docker is
49:19 like this huge thing I was like okay
49:21 it's not so bad it's fine I can do this
49:22 but like I think those are probably my
49:24 least favorite segments was the
49:26 especially the kubernetes
49:29 do you have any tips for anyone who
49:31 wants to start
49:32 Amazon Camp as a student now for example
49:35 in a self-paced mode
49:38 um tips
49:39 I don't know
49:41 use the uh just the approach studying it
49:47 um I don't know I never really thought
49:48 that much about um doing it I was just
49:51 like okay I'm doing this maybe I don't
49:53 know I think I did find this like
49:54 Community very hopeful
49:56 um and I think one of the like the set
49:59 community not only like asking them
50:01 questions because to be honest I didn't
50:03 do that as much I preferred Googling
50:04 yourself asking on the slack but even
50:06 like just read it and if anybody's stuck
50:09 helping them because like and try to
50:11 help them you realize that okay I never
50:12 understood this as well as I thought I
50:14 did and then if you're like helping them
50:16 with things at all you can further your
50:18 own understanding so I think that was
50:21 like kind of the one thing maybe I could
50:24 give I don't know I know what to give
50:25 for chips
50:27 that's a good tip I think uh at least
50:30 for me teaching is the best way of
50:31 learning something so when I can explain
50:33 a concept then I am fairly confident
50:37 that I probably understand it more or
50:39 less yeah because explaining in a way
50:41 that somebody else understands is so
50:42 much harder and like I'm not I don't
50:44 like
50:47 people because I don't like doing that
50:49 but I try to make a point of doing it in
50:52 this um Zoom camp and like encouragingly
50:55 I must say that okay it did help me
50:57 understand this better when I had to do
50:58 it like also help other people do it
51:01 then I don't know if you use it uh maybe
51:05 your
51:06 the
51:08 uh you're tired of hearing about child
51:10 GPT but what I find useful also is just
51:13 talking to the to the chatbot about the
51:18 topic and then just asking it questions
51:19 and then making sure I understand it
51:21 yeah that was very helpful I guess for
51:24 you you said you don't really like
51:25 static groups
51:26 but yeah it's like okay I'll take a fake
51:31 study group yeah I fixed a group exactly
51:34 yeah I never really thought about using
51:36 GT in that way before that's interesting
51:39 do you use it at all
51:42 I have like missed was there a few gems
51:43 but not like actually used used it
51:45 because I've never like I still go to
51:47 Google first and never thought that I
51:49 should ask jqpg
51:52 yeah
51:53 interesting um well let's see I think we
51:57 have a few questions
51:58 um
52:00 yeah one question is how can we learn
52:03 about Advanced topics like PhD level
52:05 courses
52:08 um yeah that could be hard like I don't
52:11 know I'm not sure how much like how
52:14 advanced you could go in like there are
52:16 lots of postgraduate resources available
52:18 online as well like you might have to
52:19 pay for there might be more paid than
52:21 free there might not be as much for your
52:23 resources but I think you could um go a
52:26 bit way like with page resources and
52:28 reading research articles and like I I
52:31 definitely think it is possible but
52:33 maybe harder than doing like undergrad
52:36 stuff
52:36 because there's a lot of resources for
52:38 undergrad and maybe not that many for
52:40 like PhD or whatever
52:42 yeah because I guess there is more
52:44 demand for beginner level stuff yeah
52:46 yeah
52:47 and I think people I don't know if like
52:49 that many people who are doing online
52:52 self-study pursue that degree like that
52:55 high level of study or no but I think it
52:57 is possible I like I don't think it is
52:59 impossible it might just be harder to
53:01 study that kind of stuff on your own
53:03 and also doing PhD on by yourself is
53:08 probably
53:09 difficult in a sense that uh you
53:13 probably need an institution that helps
53:15 you with research yeah yeah connections
53:18 helps you with access to I don't know
53:19 Labs or whatever yeah I don't know if
53:22 you can like I don't even think it's
53:23 possible to get a PhD like PhD level
53:26 entirely by yourself but I'm not I've
53:29 never really researched officially
53:31 getting a PhD if you've not gone to like
53:33 uni or school before I'm not sure how
53:35 that would work but I think like publish
53:37 a paper without yeah yeah I think you
53:40 could get to that knowledge level on
53:42 your own
53:44 okay
53:45 yeah but and uh also like if you spend
53:49 time doing this
53:50 you need to live on something like you
53:53 need to eat or yeah obviously it's
53:56 usually University pays money right and
53:58 yeah
53:59 if you don't get income and we spend
54:01 like six years doing research
54:06 that's a that's a practicalities of it
54:10 but the main resource here is papers
54:13 right so there are there are no not so
54:15 many other resources that you can use
54:17 that like there is no Zoom Camp about
54:18 some PhD level topic yeah I don't think
54:21 so
54:22 um but there might be like
54:24 um I think papers must be the major ones
54:27 or like getting if we can get like
54:28 subscription to libraries or something
54:29 where they have more
54:31 um in-depth stuff I'm not sure like how
54:33 that would work because not something
54:35 I've like heavily researched myself like
54:37 I've now been interested in getting to a
54:39 PhD so
54:41 by libraries you mean like this
54:43 electronic libraries from Springer or
54:46 nature or yeah yeah something like a
54:48 publication that can get you access to
54:50 like a lot more of the
54:52 the higher level stuff then you can get
54:54 access
54:55 ACM this kind of I guess organization
54:58 yeah what I'm assuming like being in a
55:00 uni would give you access to because
55:01 like a lot of them have like if you have
55:03 like UD email address or stuff you can
55:04 log in so I'm assuming that is the kind
55:06 of stuff that uni already gives you
55:08 access to so
55:10 I remember having access to all this
55:12 major
55:13 uh I didn't have to pay for for reading
55:16 articles because like it's another topic
55:18 for discussion right why do you need to
55:20 pay 50 euros for a three page four page
55:24 same thing Tactical
55:27 also finally that researchers who
55:28 publish articles need to pay to publish
55:31 articles so like this is wrong on so
55:33 many levels yeah it's like um I'm in a
55:36 lot of um scientific communities on
55:39 Twitter and more than half of them are
55:41 always complaining about how hard it is
55:43 to just get researchers published that
55:46 you think that scientific institutions
55:47 would be more welcoming of like it's new
55:49 research it's cool don't learn more
55:51 about the world but also you have to
55:53 jump like five billion groups and pay
55:54 your arm and a leg just to get your
55:56 research out there so like it seems like
55:58 a very counter-intuitive process
56:01 that's why I like this archive where
56:04 it's just all the previous prints are
56:06 there but then again you have to do a
56:08 lot of filtering yourself you don't know
56:09 yeah
56:10 the paper from archive is good or it's
56:13 not yeah I assume that is like some of
56:16 the money that Josh was like you get
56:17 curator resources like there's a lot
56:20 less chance of bad Publications coming
56:23 in those
56:26 and then another question is related to
56:28 uh burnout I don't know if you ever had
56:31 to deal with anything like that like
56:33 when you're you cannot just study
56:35 anything and all you want to do is I
56:37 don't know watch YouTube videos with
56:39 cats did whatever happened to you
56:43 um I don't know I don't think so I like
56:46 I haven't I don't know I haven't really
56:48 like taken a break in a while so I'm not
56:51 really sure I feel like if I would stop
56:52 then maybe there would be an issue but
56:54 like I just it's fine I've just been
56:55 going for a while so like I have the
56:57 momentum
57:00 and uh probably you mentioned a few
57:03 times that you like to switch between
57:05 topics like one day you read about
57:08 machine learning and then the other day
57:10 you create illustrations right yeah this
57:14 helps right
57:15 yeah like I switched between a lot of
57:17 things like
57:18 um right now I would switch between like
57:20 my bioinformatics machine learning and I
57:24 have in my illustration I have like two
57:25 or three different projects I'm doing at
57:27 the same time so it's like if I get
57:29 bored of one thing I'm like okay hop
57:30 onto the other hop on to the other side
57:31 I have like a fallback route instead of
57:34 like getting doing nothing like if I
57:37 were to doing only one thing I feel this
57:38 would be a bigger issue because I do get
57:40 bored of things very easily so I'm like
57:42 okay I'm sick of this I don't do it
57:44 because I did like two days in a row
57:45 which I know it's not a lot but it's
57:47 like I don't want to do this anymore so
57:48 I have like I can work on another
57:50 project I can do something else and then
57:52 I'm like okay I have some I'm I have
57:54 some more interest in that project a few
57:55 days later
57:57 yeah interesting well I think we should
58:00 be slowly slowly wrapping up so maybe
58:03 the last question is are there any books
58:06 or other good resources that you can
58:08 recommend to the listeners
58:11 um
58:13 that's a hard one because this is on my
58:15 watch machine learning writing machine
58:18 learning uh learning in general
58:20 bioinformatics anything you think that
58:23 would be interesting for the listeners
58:27 um
58:28 for python I can recommend like I had
58:31 done a course which was pretty which was
58:32 very interesting was python for
58:34 everybody and I liked it because the
58:36 person was not spending too long on the
58:39 stuff it was like a bit of a fast pace
58:41 but also if he went into a bit more in
58:44 depth than like okay right so and so
58:46 syntax because just because
58:49 um machine learning I haven't like
58:51 looked up that many resources as I have
58:53 for other stuff but like I can recommend
58:55 the zoom camp and your book because I
58:58 found those helpful and
59:00 um I would say that they're like good
59:01 resources so I think I can recommend
59:04 those
59:05 and for like the thing is I haven't
59:08 spent like a lot of time following
59:10 specific resources because I jump
59:12 between them so much so it's hard for me
59:15 to say like there's so many which I
59:16 would have to like I could dig into my
59:18 resources and say so it's hard to like
59:20 say off the top of my mind that okay
59:22 that's a good resource
59:24 did you take any course about studying I
59:27 know that there is a course in Coursera
59:28 learning to learn something like this
59:30 did you ever took did you ever take
59:33 anything like that or from your School
59:35 homeschooling you kind of knew how to
59:40 um I did see I have seen that learning
