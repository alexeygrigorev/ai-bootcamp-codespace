0:59 anyways yeah so please subscribe for our
1:02 channels and then we have an amazing
1:03 slack community data talks club there is
1:06 also a link in the description and yeah
1:08 so many announcements so we are actually
1:10 running a free course machine learning
1:12 engineering course
1:14 starting in september so there is link
1:16 in the description too
1:17 um
1:18 yeah and yeah finally during today's
1:21 interview you can ask any question you
1:23 want there is a link in the live chat
1:25 it's pink click on this link ask your
1:27 question and then i will be covering
1:29 these questions during the interview
1:32 so i think that's all from me now i will
1:35 open the questions i prepared for you
1:41 okay
1:47 so i have um
1:48 are you ready to start
1:52 yes sure okay so let's start
1:56 so this week we will talk about growing
1:59 a data engineering team in a scale up
2:01 and we have a special guest today maddie
2:03 so i know media as a content creator and
2:05 a data engineer so we live in the same
2:07 city berlin and this is how we met
2:10 it was actually near alexanderplatz
2:12 where i work
2:13 and yeah he has over eight years of
2:15 experience in data and engineering now
2:17 he works as a staff data engineer
2:20 and
2:21 yeah so today we will talk about scaling
2:23 data teams in a scale up so welcome
2:26 yeah thanks for
2:28 welcoming on the show with such a praise
2:31 on my youtube channel i need to keep up
2:33 the game now
2:35 okay so before we go into our main topic
2:38 let's start with your background can you
2:39 tell us about your career journey so far
2:42 yeah sure um so i started
2:46 as you mentioned about eight years ago
2:49 in the data world
2:50 doing bi classic like you know with like
2:54 microsoft tooling and mostly click and
2:58 drag and drop tooling and then i had
3:00 like actually quite fast enough
3:02 opportunity to jump early on the big
3:05 data project
3:07 so an on-premise adobe cluster back then
3:10 and i just surfed on that wave then
3:13 because uh back then it was like little
3:16 resource actually to you know
3:19 do such a such work at scale
3:22 and um
3:24 a lot of companies started to invest
3:25 into their own premise cluster so i had
3:28 like kind of a r d project but
3:31 again remember there was no i mean cloud
3:33 was there but not as popular without
3:35 free tier so basically if you wanted to
3:37 have a playground it was already cost
3:40 you a lot of money but i just searched
3:42 on that wave built my skills around data
3:44 engineering mostly big data
3:45 infrastructure
3:47 working corporate
3:49 and then move out from belgium about
3:51 three years ago trying to eat the
3:53 company
3:54 um
3:55 so like larna
3:56 and black market
3:58 and so
3:59 those experiences the last experience
4:01 work experience was mostly in the in a
4:03 scale-up uh uh company um
4:06 and yeah i think i think the the
4:08 environment is
4:10 is is pretty pretty different from from
4:13 from standard company and that's uh yeah
4:15 where i am today as i just started as a
4:18 staff
4:20 data engineer now
4:22 do you miss those days when you had to
4:24 have like a premise hadoop cluster to do
4:28 analytics or big data or i don't i hate
4:32 it i think like
4:33 it was the
4:34 the barrier to entry was so high you
4:37 needed an entire team
4:39 uh there was so much skills needed
4:42 like networking setup
4:44 servers i mean networking you still do
4:47 on the cloud but not as heavy when you
4:49 have to order the machine to the data
4:51 center you know and configure your your
4:54 network infrastructure itself so yeah
4:58 yeah i remember we had four servers
5:01 from hetzner four machines and then we
5:04 had a hadoop cluster there
5:06 and uh not only it was constantly
5:09 breaking so we didn't have a team to
5:11 look after it but also like uh most of
5:13 the time it was idle and
5:16 we data scientists would just ssh to one
5:18 of these servers to do some data science
5:20 stuff and then if somebody wants to run
5:22 a hadoop job there that
5:24 yeah
5:25 many times
5:26 yeah so today before when you were
5:29 running a big job you were blocking
5:31 everybody so people were coming at your
5:33 desk now you're just burning your credit
5:35 card so it's ideal for the months that
5:37 people are coming at your desk
5:40 okay
5:41 so what does it uh
5:43 what does it mean to be a scale-up so i
5:45 know what the startup is so startup is a
5:47 company that just started up and i know
5:49 also more or less what enterprises and
5:51 enterprise as a company a huge one with
5:54 a lot of uh people working so what is a
5:56 scale up is it something in between or
5:58 what is it yeah
5:59 um so i think there is different like
6:01 understanding of what's the scale up
6:04 that's like properly speaking is a
6:06 company which is in hyper growth so it's
6:08 a company that usually have
6:10 uh achieved uh first revenues
6:14 and they have you know another big
6:16 funding series uh to basically uh scale
6:21 up their their team because like the
6:24 space um to which they get the user
6:27 right is faster to the the engineering
6:30 team right so they need to at a certain
6:33 point have other challenge at other
6:35 skills
6:36 and so the heavily recruiting it's
6:38 usually company that goes from i don't
6:40 know
6:41 80 people to
6:43 uh to 400 in like two years or one years
6:47 even so so it's like yeah so
6:50 um when i was with glenn i was like
6:53 30 people training every month um yeah
6:56 so
6:57 it's um
6:58 it's a it's that's like mostly that i
7:01 would say the the environment and
7:03 connected to that right you have
7:05 decision that needs to make fat
7:08 be fast right so it's not like um
7:12 where you have time because you also
7:15 still need to prove yourself on the
7:17 markets or you're in competition
7:19 so you know the
7:21 the driven decision for for
7:23 such a feature are going faster
7:28 so when you describe it i imagine a
7:31 an environment where it's just a bunch
7:33 of people a lot of users and uh
7:35 everything is on fire and everyone is
7:37 running around screaming
7:39 is it similar to that yeah it's roughly
7:42 correct yeah i mean um
7:45 i think
7:47 uh different like if i look at the
7:49 different companies i've been working
7:52 um they have different challenge at
7:54 different time maybe they launched a new
7:56 product maybe they launched
7:59 like a classic uh challenge is when uh
8:01 those like european company they scale
8:04 to the us right
8:07 uh it's a completely different dimension
8:09 of them of users and of thermal usage
8:13 um like
8:15 one
8:16 i would say if you if you do for example
8:19 i don't know b b two b two b and you
8:22 have one customer that has i don't know
8:24 shopping for example and you serve
8:26 something
8:27 on the e-commerce over there
8:29 um it has so much impact because the
8:31 united states is so big that it's way
8:34 bigger than what you can have on mar on
8:36 european market so that brings like
8:39 stream
8:40 other challenge so this is like an
8:42 example another example is like a new
8:44 project feature right which is quite
8:46 challenging
8:47 um
8:48 so
8:49 um yeah i think it's it's it's really
8:51 depend but yeah it's there is always a
8:53 lot of stuff on fire uh and you need to
8:56 basically make compromise to see what's
8:58 what's the biggest one
9:00 to focus on
9:02 and not only that you also need to grow
9:04 a team right and then yeah you need to
9:06 quickly fix things that
9:08 like your production issues
9:10 in such a way that maybe later you will
9:12 regret but you need to to fix us up
9:15 right and then you also need to hire a
9:16 lot of people and then all these people
9:18 come and also add these code fixes right
9:21 and then
9:22 i guess it's uh
9:24 it's quite a challenge right
9:26 yes as
9:27 exactly as you mentioned you need to do
9:29 compromise between
9:30 [Music]
9:31 speed and quality all the time
9:36 yeah because otherwise you're
9:38 you're just collecting technical depth
9:40 if you just use speeds right
9:42 um
9:43 and this dimension
9:45 of onboarding people
9:48 is i think for me that was the biggest
9:51 uh one of the biggest challenge
9:53 uh where you have so much people coming
9:55 in uh not just in your team but as a
9:58 stakeholder you know
10:01 um so yeah it's
10:02 it's i think for me it's like the two
10:05 two biggest things like
10:07 how do you make your compromise uh all
10:10 the time and how do you keep your your
10:12 onboarding process
10:14 uh smooth and
10:16 also your product ready to scale
10:18 internally or externally right
10:21 so hyper growth here that you
10:24 were talking about refers to both
10:26 growing in terms of user users user base
10:29 also in terms of traffic consequently
10:31 right and also in terms of uh the number
10:34 of people who work at the company and it
10:37 happens at the same time right
10:39 i mean it depends but usually uh they
10:42 want to hire a lot of people because
10:43 they get a lot of user and they have uh
10:46 they have new challenges right
10:49 so what are some of the recent companies
10:52 that you would describe as scale up
10:54 maybe you heard about gorillas this is
10:56 like grocery delivery would it be a
10:58 scale up
10:59 yeah yeah yeah and definitely i mean in
11:01 berlin there is a lot i think what i
11:03 would not call a skill up even if
11:06 there's tech companies like zalendo for
11:08 example it's more established or spotify
11:10 enterprise yeah because they're already
11:14 you know reach um i would say they're
11:17 still growing but not at the same curve
11:20 that would say
11:21 uh a company and they have like more
11:23 established revenue that makes them you
11:26 know more comfortable to
11:28 to survive
11:29 such a period as we have now for example
11:33 and scale ups typically they have
11:37 investors right so they are not
11:38 necessarily
11:40 or earning all this money they are
11:41 usually
11:42 um they just cost maybe investment
11:44 around so they have borrowed money so
11:47 it's not yeah necessary they won't
11:49 yeah most most of the time i'm not such
11:51 a huge fan i mean that's been like what
11:54 the landscape has been like this past uh
11:56 these past years and with huge funding
11:59 um
12:00 was it reasonable not that's another
12:02 story but yeah usually there is uh
12:05 that's what i was saying is that there
12:07 is some achieved first revenues right
12:11 but the
12:13 the value is still yet to be proven
12:16 and that's why basically you bet on
12:20 on investing into a lot of features and
12:22 a lot of engineer to basically
12:26 reach a
12:27 state where you you're comfortable
12:29 and what do data engineers do in a
12:32 scale-up environment like how how is it
12:34 how is this work different from you know
12:37 your typical enterprise
12:40 um i mean i would say like the
12:43 i would put the the so we put like the
12:45 the landscape and so
12:48 here it is you're joining a team and
12:51 like
12:52 next week so a data engineering team has
12:54 uh or in a data platform team
12:57 um
12:59 has maybe
13:00 uh multiple cons
13:02 consumer internally right data is data
13:05 scientist and so let's say you have
13:08 100 of them today or maybe way less 50
13:11 but the growth of the for the months is
13:14 really big right
13:16 so aside from the people you would
13:18 expect a lot of more use case um
13:21 different uh way of using your products
13:24 uh as a data platform engineer
13:27 um and so you need to think when you
13:31 build stuff and how how you can scale
13:33 the usability directly and remove
13:36 yourself from the equation
13:38 so that's like that was mostly my role i
13:40 forgot to mention in the intro but
13:42 because there is multiple definition of
13:43 data engineer right
13:45 but i've been working more as a data
13:47 platform engineer providing tool and
13:49 service i've been doing before
13:51 more like really writing pipeline and
13:55 i would say business logic to deliver to
13:57 other
13:58 internal data stakeholder
14:01 there will still be those kind of people
14:03 in scale up right
14:05 but it's the same thing they need to
14:07 think um
14:09 how they can scale like
14:11 you know okay i'm doing a small pipeline
14:13 that reach a google sheet and it's
14:16 totally fine for this small use case but
14:19 then suddenly that google sheets blow it
14:21 up because there is way more data giving
14:23 a certain context to come back we we go
14:26 to the us for example so what do you do
14:29 right um
14:31 and so that's the thing you need to
14:32 anticipate more about things going to
14:36 break
14:37 uh way sooner
14:38 uh than it would be i would say like in
14:40 startup you can make
14:42 more saying a bit more cowboy because
14:45 you say okay let's let's just have users
14:48 right and
14:49 and do shortcut and maybe there is some
14:52 technical depth down the line that we're
14:54 going to regret
14:55 but it's fine let's just bring value and
14:57 go for it and in scallop environment uh
15:01 yeah it's it's a bit different because
15:03 if you do the shortcuts
15:05 uh without thinking too much it's gonna
15:07 cost you way sooner than than expected
15:11 so here is in the studio so
15:13 as a data platform engineer or data
15:16 engineer working in the data platform so
15:18 your role is to let others build data
15:21 pipelines so build tools for that so
15:23 then data scientists data analyst
15:25 whoever needs data they can use this
15:28 platform
15:29 to do i don't know whatever they need
15:32 and you need to build it in such a way
15:34 that i don't know it can withstand 10
15:37 times more traffic than
15:39 yeah and so i think like coming back to
15:42 the onboarding thing um
15:44 i think it's super there is a lot of
15:47 education uh to do around those
15:49 different people because they all come
15:51 from different background
15:53 against like data role in general the
15:55 name they're super confusing right data
15:57 scientists analytics engineer like
16:00 how deep the technical person is does he
16:02 has uh experience with that technology
16:05 or that right and so also your job as a
16:08 data platform engineer is really to make
16:10 it
16:11 as simple as possible so that you know
16:14 you is you like
16:16 assume a certain technical level of your
16:20 data consumer consumers okay i think
16:21 they're going to be able to do that and
16:23 that
16:24 but not that much and it's pretty well
16:26 documented you have maybe you know an
16:28 onboarding session
16:30 um a support channel that is there
16:33 that is reactive that listen to the user
16:36 so so yeah it's it's it's a really
16:40 um
16:41 kind of like a
16:43 startup inside the scale-up where you
16:46 you really need to listen closely to
16:48 your consumer because they're growing
16:51 um
16:52 they're growing quickly
16:53 and if you just uh behave like okay i'm
16:57 gonna do that pipeline myself right
17:00 uh because it's faster
17:02 like you could do for example in other
17:04 set of company
17:06 um
17:07 you will regret down the line because
17:09 you're not you're still
17:11 putting yourself in the equation as a
17:13 dependency right
17:14 um and here it's it's really about
17:16 leveraging
17:18 other
17:19 data data people
17:22 and in practical terms what does having
17:24 a data platform usually mean is it like
17:26 an airflow cluster and then
17:28 some other things that you can use from
17:30 this airflow cluster or
17:33 yeah so i think it's it's it's more than
17:35 that so definitely it's uh because this
17:38 is like just one piece uh
17:41 it's like uh having a car without the
17:43 driving
17:44 license you cannot do much
17:47 um i mean you could but then i probably
17:49 thinks it's gonna break i think that's
17:51 so airflow is the car right what is the
17:54 driving license um the driving license
17:56 would be probably like
17:59 an example repo how you should structure
18:01 a thing what's uh how you should handle
18:04 secrets for example in airflow what's
18:06 the naming convention
18:08 um maybe also configure uh some airflow
18:12 pipeline as a yammel file if they're
18:14 generic rather than having to rewrite
18:16 them all in all
18:17 um again this is a classic thing where
18:21 you take an airflow dag yeah it's okay
18:24 we can we can do you know manually and
18:26 copy paste there are slightly different
18:28 we are not going into the struggle of
18:31 having a yaml file that generate dags
18:34 uh there is easy frameworks by the way
18:36 to help you to do so now but the point
18:38 is um yeah again you need to think ahead
18:41 and say okay are we going to have 10
18:43 pipeline like this or 20 pipeline next
18:45 month like this right
18:48 so maybe we should better invest that
18:50 time now
18:51 but it's always about compromise right
18:54 but it's really uh to coming back to
18:56 your question
18:58 um the driving license is basically
19:00 all the best practice that you can put
19:03 from the start
19:05 so that i think those
19:07 things goes nuts bananas and heart of
19:10 control
19:12 and that's that's usually the case if
19:14 you have a lot of users they have so
19:16 much imagination that's
19:17 at the end you end up with
19:20 a lot of
19:22 interesting things on your platform
19:25 so in some ways so data platform for the
19:27 car
19:28 with the car part it's uh
19:31 airflow plus i guess some connections
19:33 maybe to date uh databases uh data lakes
19:37 and so on right so then you can read
19:39 from somewhere right to to some other
19:41 place
19:42 and then in addition to that you have a
19:44 set of
19:46 rules or playbook or something that
19:48 people can use in order to effectively
19:50 use
19:51 the
19:52 airflow part right the car part so they
19:54 can drive the car right you as a data
19:56 engineer you need to make sure that uh
19:59 that they
20:00 first of all the these things are up to
20:02 date right and users know how to use it
20:04 and you i guess help them also figure
20:07 out like how exactly they should use it
20:09 yeah that's exactly that yeah
20:13 and uh
20:14 okay who do we need to actually build
20:16 this thing uh this touch of data
20:18 platform
20:20 yeah i think i can tell about like
20:23 some mistake
20:25 i saw in the past
20:27 um is that you probably for a scale-up
20:30 you probably don't want to make
20:32 compromise on seniority
20:34 you know there is just saying uh
20:37 if you pay peanuts you get monkey
20:41 the point is uh
20:43 you shouldn't um
20:45 try to re you should try to recruit a
20:48 lot of senior folks first to set those
20:51 best practice right you don't need none
20:53 of them
20:54 but if you just are relying on on junior
20:58 or new starter you know intimidating the
21:00 career to set up things that scale right
21:03 at huge huge fast pace
21:05 um
21:06 it's it will be really difficult because
21:07 the problem is that learning on the job
21:10 is really challenging because
21:13 the challenge just fall down on your
21:15 desk right it's like okay and now we're
21:17 going to do yes you need to scale so
21:19 it's not just okay what if we put that
21:21 feature no it's like it's happening next
21:24 month
21:24 um
21:25 so yeah um also trying to get people uh
21:30 with a niche
21:31 skills if you need again it's the same
21:34 reason because it's really difficult to
21:36 ramp up on certain technology
21:39 let's say you have an
21:41 eugene use case um with streaming right
21:45 and you you need to implement the kafka
21:47 cluster
21:49 um
21:50 don't expect like people that has no
21:52 never work with kafka if they even if
21:54 they're brilliant engineer right
21:57 to just learn by themselves and set up
21:59 the whole thing to to scale up hard like
22:03 even if it's like temporary
22:05 uh like an expert in that that has huge
22:07 seniority
22:08 same if you're going to the cloud right
22:11 um
22:12 and all most of the company are already
22:14 in the cloud or if you're changing cloud
22:16 provider just get someone that has
22:18 experience with that
22:20 um
22:21 and and that will help to to
22:24 to put the best practice in place
22:25 because
22:26 i mean even you and me right we are both
22:29 experienced in the domain but whenever
22:31 we tackle the new technology it's always
22:33 super hard to say is it the right way to
22:36 use it right you need like there is a
22:39 valuable
22:40 um experience of having to
22:43 work before with technology if you need
22:45 to scale it fast yeah
22:48 and so you mentioned we realized that we
22:50 need a kafka cluster but if we don't
22:52 have experience using kafka how do we
22:55 know that we actually need it it would
22:57 be funny to hire a person who is who has
23:00 this experience with kafka only for them
23:03 when they start working to say hey
23:06 like we shouldn't use kafka here
23:09 yeah no that that's uh that's fairly
23:11 true uh there is like an architecture
23:14 decision that should be also drive by
23:16 some seniority people right but i think
23:19 you need somebody like that to write to
23:21 yeah like when you
23:23 designing the platform yeah but but but
23:26 the point is also at lower level like
23:28 let's say you have the you have engineer
23:31 in general software engine you're just
23:32 comfortable with subsystem maybe rabbit
23:35 mq right and they want to consider kafka
23:37 and you know some of them have heard of
23:39 that some of them have been playing a
23:41 bit like they consume right to kafka
23:43 topic but the point is
23:45 just uh having like high level knowledge
23:49 on this to possibly make
23:51 some decision right and some good
23:53 decision
23:54 is not enough to say okay now we're
23:56 going to implement it and serve it a
23:58 skill with a team and we're going to
23:59 maintain it right and that's like
24:01 a huge difference because the point is
24:03 that you're not going i mean you're
24:04 gonna start with one or two topic right
24:07 to to try it out and then the next pump
24:09 probably gonna have 15 and by the end of
24:12 like three months you're gonna have
24:14 hundreds of topics right and if you
24:16 don't have or you didn't have the kafka
24:18 expert at the beginning
24:20 then it's really hard to untie
24:22 everything right uh
24:24 to to do so concrete example i can give
24:26 you i was mentioning kappa just like of
24:29 the way but
24:30 for data folks it's like um data
24:32 contract with a user so you know
24:35 software engineer push data to kafka
24:38 and they have usage from service to
24:40 service right as a pub sub and they
24:42 often really not
24:44 care about what's happening downstream
24:45 and then data team is going to apply to
24:47 kafka downstream to s3 and then this
24:49 transformation
24:51 a best practice to do in that sense is
24:53 to
24:55 put actually some data contract with the
24:58 data folks and say okay this is
25:00 um the schema that we're going to have
25:02 everything is going to be typed so we
25:04 are not going to put like random json
25:06 it's going to be like avro for example
25:09 on the schema registry you can consult
25:11 the latest version if there is a change
25:14 during uh
25:15 in the schema this is what we're going
25:17 to allow of change uh this is our
25:19 process for changing schema and so all
25:22 those things will smooth for the things
25:24 down the line because then if you have a
25:26 new user of capca you just you know read
25:28 the guideline and that's it
25:30 but if there is no guideline again
25:32 people are really creative
25:35 and at the end you're just suffering um
25:38 consuming those stuff as data platform
25:40 teams say oh
25:42 there is a data type change in that
25:44 schema
25:46 that was allowed or there is not even
25:48 like you know proper schema it's just a
25:50 json that's evolving it's really hard to
25:52 parse
25:53 we have i computes
25:55 cost on our spark cluster or data
25:58 warehouse because the data is not super
26:00 well modeled from the from the source so
26:03 yeah you you basically it's just a few
26:05 examples
26:07 create a lot of of downstream problem
26:09 that you could have avoided with
26:12 some best practices from the start
26:14 so i guess if you don't have experience
26:16 in kafka then you might not know that
26:20 schemas change or you might not realize
26:22 right and he went okay i'll just send
26:24 i'll just be sending jason
26:27 what can possibly go wrong right but
26:29 then in a couple of months something
26:30 happens yeah data changes right and you
26:33 just didn't think about this but person
26:35 who had
26:36 uh explicitly has experienced this who
26:40 probably lived through this
26:42 experience of having to somehow manage
26:44 this
26:45 ever-changing json files
26:47 perhaps maybe you did have this
26:49 experience that's why you're bringing
26:51 this up right yeah
26:53 then these people yeah they know hey hey
26:56 wait a minute like we first need to
26:57 think about this thing because when
26:59 there are 100
27:01 topics then it will bite us right yeah
27:05 uh we have quite a few questions um so
27:08 the question we had we have is um
27:11 hi i recently got a senior data
27:13 engineering role and i expect it to be
27:16 fast paced
27:17 any idea as to how i can manage the pace
27:20 while ensuring personal growth
27:24 that's a really good question
27:27 i've seen
27:30 depressed data engineer and scale-up
27:32 environment sometimes because they
27:35 you know uh we're talking about that
27:37 trade between speed and quality
27:39 um i mean sometimes you're not really in
27:42 control of that decision you know there
27:44 is politics in place and you just redo
27:47 and so if you are in a place where you
27:49 keep redoing things and you keep like uh
27:51 just distinguish fire right without
27:53 having a proper vision and i mean always
27:57 the same fire um that's hurtful um and
28:01 it's also not really
28:04 interesting for learning because you're
28:06 just redoing the same things and the
28:08 same fixes
28:10 so i think it's really depend on
28:13 [Music]
28:14 the general culture uh i would say that
28:17 in a scale up like once you get like
28:20 above 200 people
28:22 i would say
28:24 um
28:25 you have basically
28:26 a macro culture of the company and the
28:29 micro culture reading team that could be
28:32 quite different okay
28:34 so i would say talk with your
28:37 [Music]
28:39 with your future teammates your
28:41 your
28:42 your engineer to feel it if you are
28:44 accepted i understand like uh
28:47 uh yeah so you really got the the role
28:50 so you just started actually
28:52 but um
28:53 yeah i think it's a discussion within
28:54 the team to basically
28:57 make those compromise together i think
28:59 it's important so
29:02 i think it's just a part of negotiating
29:04 uh if you just keep fixing all the
29:07 things right without like having the
29:09 time to build
29:10 stuff that is more interesting where you
29:12 can learn
29:14 um
29:15 then it's just that
29:17 there is
29:18 a problem somewhere else where someone
29:20 is just accepting everything and it's
29:22 just not putting a buffer right
29:24 and again it's not just say hey let's uh
29:26 see each other in the months and we'll
29:28 build those stuff and coming back with
29:30 uh we were rockets it's just about
29:32 compromise just say okay you need this
29:35 thing tomorrow can you do it uh can you
29:37 have it in three days i want to refactor
29:40 this part right and for bigger projects
29:42 it's a lot of communication
29:45 with the stakeholder to say hey uh we
29:47 want to get away with this this is all
29:49 the pain points that we've been notified
29:51 um we this so if you're intentional with
29:55 what you want to improve
29:57 and um
29:59 the time that you're gonna save
30:01 um then i think uh you're gonna have a
30:04 lot of space to to learn and grow but i
30:07 it's true that
30:08 it can be challenging um to have to
30:12 to make those compromise and it's highly
30:14 depending on
30:16 who is supporting you in in which team
30:18 you are ending up
30:20 and he also brought up this topic of
30:22 culture and i guess
30:24 a company that recently was a startup
30:26 but now all of a sudden xp is
30:28 experiencing growth then the culture is
30:32 now they might not
30:34 had a chance to adapt
30:36 to
30:38 this uh you know new environment right
30:40 so then maybe as a senior data engineer
30:43 you can try to
30:45 somehow influence the culture right you
30:47 can say okay no this is not how we
30:49 should do this because we're no longer a
30:50 startup because we expect that the next
30:53 week there could be two times three
30:55 times ten times more traffic right and
30:56 then uh as a senior
30:59 data engineer or as a senior engineer in
31:01 general i think sometimes it's kind of
31:03 expected that you
31:04 bring these topics up right yeah and so
31:08 yeah it's it's a really great point you
31:10 you brought up that um
31:12 basically you you have to
31:15 know that the general company is in
31:17 transformation like huge shifts
31:20 and
31:21 they
31:22 um they are open right i mean they
31:24 should uh in terms of cultures say okay
31:28 we used to you know do one release every
31:30 week and that was fine uh said no but we
31:32 have too much bring we need to change
31:34 our process we need to change the way we
31:36 work
31:37 uh i mean that's
31:39 uh so this is
31:41 you you you have space uh to speak up
31:44 but you have to take that space and
31:47 it's true that sometimes people they
31:49 they end up in a scale-up environment a
31:51 bit like randomly you know but they're
31:53 not really aware that it's okay it's a
31:55 company that's growing a lot
31:58 but so you you should be stepping back
32:00 saying okay there is a lot of stuff that
32:02 not going to work exactly as you
32:03 mentioned because people think oh we're
32:05 still a startup we can do that i'll get
32:07 that that's not working
32:09 as soon as like a simple thing like
32:11 sending
32:13 birthday uh you know or goodbye email to
32:17 the wall company you know as the company
32:19 grow like in corporate you're not going
32:21 to say hey it's my birthday and
32:24 you love him but i saw some tech you
32:26 know some scale of like still doing that
32:27 and you feel like okay you know we
32:29 probably shouldn't do that anymore i
32:31 mean it's a really minor thing right
32:33 it's just like a small story but you get
32:35 the point there is a lot of uh internal
32:38 thing that needs to change and you just
32:40 need to embrace that change and suggest
32:42 uh how we can move forward
32:45 and uh this uh so this uh question is a
32:48 bit ambiguous and maybe on purpose
32:51 so it says while ensuring personal
32:52 growth and personal growth can mean
32:54 different things for different people
32:56 right so what kind of personal growth do
32:58 you think you can expect from a
33:01 scale-up
33:02 like is it more like
33:04 this culture changing sort of personal
33:06 growth
33:07 i don't know leading a team like you i
33:10 guess had experience
33:12 with or it's more like new tools uh
33:14 scaling problems or all of the above
33:18 yeah um
33:21 yeah i think like when i heard like
33:23 personal growth i think it's like both
33:25 from technical and you know
33:27 on the ic track individual contributor
33:30 or the manager track and all about
33:32 leadership
33:33 um and everything else but i think it's
33:36 uh
33:37 it's both sides but i i again it's um
33:40 [Music]
33:42 um
33:44 yeah it's it's it's uh it's it's it's
33:46 really heavily depending where where you
33:48 you ending up
33:50 um
33:51 but but you do have huge opportunity
33:53 over there you have i would say if i
33:55 compare to let's take the problem the
33:57 other way around
33:58 if you are in a slow growth company
34:01 right they might not have that much
34:03 budget they might you may hire maybe one
34:05 or two people in your team or you know
34:07 like it's completely different but here
34:09 you have opportunity to work on the
34:11 onboarding process get the other people
34:14 up to speed improving um your tool sets
34:17 uh improving the
34:20 the data platform that you you serve
34:23 uh because you have a lot of use case
34:25 and people are screaming right and i
34:27 feel
34:28 it's
34:29 even if it's like a constant fire and
34:31 it's agreed it might not fit everybody
34:34 depending on their
34:35 mood
34:37 but at least you know that
34:39 some people are using what you're doing
34:41 right
34:42 and in a slow growth company maybe
34:44 you're gonna work in on that small
34:45 project or that existing project
34:49 um
34:50 and it's it's harder to see your your
34:53 impacts where
34:54 in in in a scale-up environment you have
34:56 so much opportunities that uh
34:59 you're gonna see
35:00 at a certain point an impact that you're
35:03 gonna do
35:04 so would you recommend somebody
35:07 let's say it's a senior and that person
35:09 is considering
35:11 multiple offers and one of these offers
35:13 is for a scale-up
35:15 company and let's say another offer is
35:18 for enterprise so would you suggest that
35:20 person to go with a scale up or with
35:23 enterprise
35:25 i think it's personal life uh i mean
35:29 now i've heard uh both things uh i mean
35:33 and you know i both have kids i think
35:35 like when you have kids for depending on
35:37 the you say situation in life right it's
35:40 it's it's different
35:41 uh what what you want what you you do
35:44 next to your job
35:45 uh i mean people are really fine to do
35:48 just nine to five you know and have
35:50 their family time and then don't look
35:51 further they look to learn something new
35:54 and there is nothing wrong with that
35:55 right uh everybody is different
35:57 everybody has different uh ambition
36:01 um so i would not i would i would not
36:03 advise i give like i think it's a really
36:06 opinionated choice right now i can tell
36:08 like okay if you're
36:10 you want to grow your career
36:13 faster then definitely a scale up
36:17 or a big fan company is is a good place
36:20 uh
36:21 a big fan company you will meet
36:22 incredible people because there is a
36:24 base level which is really high right
36:28 um so you're gonna work on a really
36:30 niche product so the problem is not that
36:33 maybe your impact is not gonna be that
36:35 big right you're gonna work on that
36:38 google doc comments you know color like
36:41 it's gonna be really really small right
36:44 but you're gonna
36:45 learn technically so much things and
36:46 build a network which is insane
36:49 um
36:50 and for me like i actually is there to
36:52 go into a thanks so that's the third
36:55 option i would say
36:56 a big tech company like facebook or
36:58 netflix
36:59 but
37:00 i found like a scale up is actually the
37:03 good compromise with the startup because
37:06 they have money to run a couple of years
37:08 right there is interest i say normally
37:10 there is first revenue generated
37:13 and uh but they're still
37:15 not at the same low size than uh of
37:17 course a big tech company so you could
37:19 have project that has a huge impact
37:21 company-wide right
37:23 so i feel like it's it's the best of the
37:27 two worlds between a startup and a fan
37:29 for for growth
37:31 um but now it can be really stressful
37:34 uh it can be you know time consuming or
37:38 extra hours here there i mean it's also
37:40 depending on the culture right in the
37:42 u.s it's like it's
37:44 even more different than europe
37:47 um
37:48 but yeah take that into consideration uh
37:51 also again do reverse i always do
37:53 reverse interview after the process
37:56 i do one more interview with
37:58 uh the manager that i'm gonna work or
38:00 some teammates right directly messing
38:03 them and work and just you know
38:04 chat a bit more informally about like my
38:07 concern and so on to to to grasp like
38:10 what's the mood over there and what do
38:12 you ask
38:14 um yeah
38:16 so
38:17 what's what's the most boring thing at
38:19 work
38:20 um
38:21 was the
38:22 um
38:23 i'm easily even asked that during the
38:26 interview process because i don't have
38:28 the offer yet so like the people getting
38:29 interviewed they're not sure if i'm the
38:31 right fit right i mean in general
38:33 because there is multiple people
38:35 um asking but i think there is question
38:37 that you can ask
38:39 like that
38:40 or what are you used to work during the
38:42 weekend or not um so
38:45 um yeah at what time is you do you stop
38:48 uh
38:48 it's it's like informality question but
38:51 um
38:52 if you ask that on everybody on your
38:54 interview process you you get the
38:57 the graphs of the of the general filter
38:59 and how it's it's driven
39:02 and would you answer be different for a
39:05 junior specialist so somebody who is
39:06 just entering the field of data
39:08 engineering or maybe just has has less
39:10 than one year of experience
39:12 like for them yeah that's a good point
39:16 yeah maybe it will be just too boring
39:18 right to yeah work nine to five yeah
39:20 yeah indeed so as you're coming by i
39:22 think it's depending on your on
39:25 where you're situating in life and
39:27 corporate versus scale up yeah um
39:30 that's where concerning if you already
39:32 have a couple of years of experience if
39:34 it junior yet then definitely that's
39:36 that's the best way to
39:38 dive into the cold water
39:40 uh you don't have i would say other
39:44 let's say hard commitments on different
39:46 things so you can really spend a lot of
39:49 time
39:50 on your work at least for the first
39:51 years to just uh ramp up
39:54 um and yeah i've seen like
39:57 people
39:58 growing super super fast in scale up in
40:01 in a lot of scale up i think in that
40:03 company also there has like two
40:05 promotion around per year right
40:08 and i've seen some unique talent okay
40:10 this is like really unique and that's
40:12 happening like something
40:14 don't get mad don't get me wrong but
40:15 like being promoted two times a year
40:18 it's just because there we are
40:19 delivering so much
40:21 um again everybody is different
40:23 everybody has a live context which is
40:26 different but the point is you have the
40:27 opportunity right in a classic company
40:29 that that would never happen that would
40:31 never happen because you won't have the
40:32 opportunity it's not about the promotion
40:35 around it's also about having the
40:36 projects right to basically show off
40:39 right and i think in one year you know
40:42 in a certain scale up when you see their
40:44 products you know before and after the
40:46 year a lot of things could happen right
40:48 so yeah why not
40:51 yeah another question we have i am
40:53 leading a data team in a hyper growth
40:55 scaling up company in lion fronts how do
40:58 you guys source big data engineers i
41:00 guess these questions how where do we
41:02 find talent how do we find data
41:04 engineers
41:06 we don't find them there is not enough
41:08 of them
41:09 [Laughter]
41:11 so you will not not answer this question
41:13 no no no no no
41:17 no no i think um
41:19 there is something
41:21 that definitely helped and that the
41:23 scaleup need to work
41:25 on uh easily to start to work on is the
41:28 engineering culture
41:30 so a good example of establish tech
41:32 company like airbnb
41:35 for example a lot of engineers know them
41:39 of course because of the service but
41:41 they know them on the engineering parts
41:42 because they have so much operations
41:44 project they have an insane blog right
41:47 they speak at conference
41:49 uh so so yeah you know them because of
41:52 what they do on the engineering side um
41:55 and uh i think a scale scale up need to
41:58 invest into those things into
41:59 contributing back to the community to
42:01 show this is our engineering environment
42:04 and i feel that's the best way to
42:06 attract talents like
42:08 engineering in general they're mostly in
42:11 uh i mean attracted by injuring problems
42:14 so uh if they see there is like you know
42:17 brian mike said in that open source
42:19 project from that company
42:22 um yeah when they are passion they
42:24 passionate they they they actually look
42:27 at that and also it's a it's a way to
42:30 filter some people
42:33 i mean to get some people which are more
42:35 curious right i think like curiosity is
42:39 and it's a really great value to to get
42:43 when you're seeking for talent it's
42:45 really hard to evaluate right
42:48 like you can ask like okay do you have
42:50 side project
42:51 how far do you
42:52 often do you read the technical book or
42:54 right but
42:56 i think when you get people
42:59 contributing on your open source project
43:01 reaching out to you after uh you know a
43:04 tech conference because they they heard
43:06 you speaking you know that those people
43:09 there are you know curious and
43:12 willing to learn and passionate about
43:14 what they do
43:15 uh which uh easily show up as a talent
43:18 that can grow
43:20 uh
43:21 really well
43:22 and you also at the beginning you
43:24 mentioned
43:25 that you sometimes met with depressed
43:27 data engineers i guess in this
43:29 environment where people might already
43:32 felt like squeezed lemons now you also
43:34 ask them to
43:36 you know if you want as a vp of
43:38 engineering you realize okay now i want
43:40 to improve culture because we want to or
43:43 change culture because we want to
43:45 attract more talent so we want to be to
43:47 have like nice employer brands right and
43:49 now you tell all your squeezed engineers
43:52 to also write articles and then okay
43:55 like now i work uh
43:57 i don't know 12 hours per day so where
43:59 do i find time that's again i guess the
44:02 question of
44:03 culture right yeah i think yeah it's a
44:06 balance but it's it's it's a
44:08 um
44:09 it's a really good point and coming back
44:12 to
44:12 to reality that uh
44:15 not everything is uh is green and nice
44:17 um
44:19 but uh but like
44:21 normally like for those kind of
44:22 opportunities of conference and blog to
44:26 also be lead by it should be lead by
44:28 more seniority people
44:30 um so i would say if we come back to our
44:34 example with the junior person right uh
44:36 it's
44:37 um it's not necessarily him that's gonna
44:39 write but he's gonna have opportunity to
44:41 write
44:42 uh a blog about it it's gonna take extra
44:45 work right
44:46 um
44:47 but i believe that the reward is really
44:50 is really insane to give another example
44:53 i know it's really uh also opinionated
44:56 and i think they they don't do it
44:57 anymore uh google is the 20
45:00 i don't know if you remember that where
45:02 you have 20
45:03 yeah we have 20 of your time to work on
45:07 any tech any project
45:09 uh if you have to justify everything i
45:12 never been too much in detail
45:14 um and a lot of people were saying oh
45:16 but it's not 100
45:18 it's not 80 and 20 percent it's under 20
45:22 right and up to work on the weekend for
45:25 this project
45:27 where you need to show up something
45:30 but google maps
45:32 was built on those 20
45:35 so
45:35 the point is that it was never driven by
45:38 um it was an opportunity there and
45:41 yeah someone take it on on the side
45:44 um so i think you the point is that you
45:47 have you have opportunities to
45:50 um
45:51 to show up but it it will require um
45:54 quite some work and i think at a certain
45:56 point you can find a balance where
45:57 you're not to squeeze at lyme and
45:59 as you as you mentioned
46:02 i uh i also happen at work to be an
46:05 editor of our corporate tech blog
46:08 and what i notice is sometimes
46:11 somebody works on a very cool thing
46:13 and then i asked them hey can you write
46:16 something about this because this is so
46:17 cool and i get a bit of a pushback but
46:19 this is nothing special i just do my
46:21 work
46:22 so i'm wondering if you
46:26 if you have a suggestion for me like how
46:28 do i convince them that actually what
46:29 they work on
46:30 is not only you know usual
46:34 i mean it's not usual but it's also
46:37 quite interesting and many other people
46:38 will also be interested in learning this
46:40 thing about the problem the solution and
46:43 things like this yeah so
46:45 any advice i recommend for any junior
46:47 getting in the industry is writing
46:49 content or doing content in general and
46:52 it can be when i say content it can be a
46:55 pr uh um on the on a repo it can be your
46:59 project that you push on
47:02 as open source
47:03 it can be a blog
47:05 video anything because the best way to
47:07 learn is actually to teach it to to
47:09 someone else right
47:12 so that's like the first thing and the
47:13 second thing so i think like there is a
47:16 lot of value in writing in general
47:18 uh because it force you to summarize
47:21 things out right you get to a review
47:23 process when you get feedback from
47:25 people
47:26 um and then afterwards as you mentioned
47:29 is that when you share it you get
47:31 feedback also from other people
47:33 and fun fact is that you get
47:36 most of the time you get more feedback
47:38 from people outside of your company than
47:41 inside your company because your things
47:43 are so niche and you are so connected in
47:47 2022 online right
47:49 i think this community is a really good
47:51 example you would never
47:53 be able to launch like an
47:55 on mostly online community like five
47:57 years ago right but if we get more
48:00 network online and feedback online
48:04 um that it's it's a really good
48:06 opportunity or for you to get feedback
48:08 on this oh actually that design you know
48:10 it sucks and it's okay
48:13 you're gonna have haters anyway but it's
48:16 it's it puts you yourself in perspective
48:18 and say okay and other people say okay
48:20 actually uh this is really great and we
48:23 did exactly the same but slightly
48:25 different you know
48:26 um yeah i had long talks with people
48:29 that read some of my blog posts online
48:32 right so we book uh an hour and i
48:35 learned so much from them i learn as
48:37 much as
48:38 as they give so people see that as a
48:40 work you know like oh i have to do this
48:42 for others
48:43 but you're gonna learn um a lot through
48:46 the process pro and counts so it's it's
48:50 a really best way to to evaluate where
48:52 are you standing
48:53 how do do you get this call so somebody
48:55 read your article they reach out to you
48:57 on linkedin saying hey amazing article
48:59 and then you ask them
49:01 can we get on a call and i want to ask
49:03 you about your yeah you know what do you
49:05 think about this
49:06 it's a it's the other way around or are
49:08 i mean
49:10 so they asked directly to to
49:13 okay
49:14 they want more insight maybe because you
49:16 know sometimes in the article you need
49:18 to take some shortcuts
49:20 or sometimes they they reach out um
49:23 by chat and they
49:24 they give like a pretty technical
49:26 question you know like okay you didn't
49:28 mention this can you please elaborate on
49:31 how
49:32 um
49:33 and uh and yeah and then i'm coming back
49:36 to them because i know they have such
49:37 implementation and i'm like oh by the
49:39 way i fixed that issue why do you think
49:42 no it's like it's a win-win so that's i
49:44 really want to insist on that it's it's
49:46 it's most of the time it's uh
49:49 it's a it's always a win-win when people
49:51 uh
49:52 with shouts when you
49:54 at least and when you start to you know
49:56 go more to further than the hello world
50:00 project because when it's a company blog
50:02 it's often not an award project right
50:05 so i think there is way more value
50:07 actually um in writing those blogs than
50:09 your personal blog is also super great
50:11 to do but like company blog can bring a
50:14 lot of value
50:16 yeah thanks uh in a scale up in a scale
50:19 up people usually need to work on a wide
50:21 range of tasks right so like you
50:25 pretty much a generalist but then as
50:28 the scale-up grows evolves
50:31 you know these people might need to
50:32 specialize later do you think it's okay
50:35 and how to deal with this specialization
50:38 um yeah i i
50:40 i don't think you're that much i mean
50:42 data engineer already is a generalist
50:45 right but everything we can in that role
50:48 i think it's the same for most of the
50:49 data role
50:51 uh you know like data centers might be
50:53 doing a lot of pipelining scale up until
50:56 they found like a proper data
50:58 engineering team to help them
51:00 um
51:01 so
51:02 going
51:03 so i think it's a again it's depending
51:06 on the setup i didn't feel like
51:08 i was too much generalist
51:11 and as the
51:12 the the team are growing right
51:15 your responsibility will be scoping down
51:18 and more niche and then hence your skill
51:20 set right
51:23 so
51:24 to give a concrete example
51:27 uh i don't know let's say you
51:30 are the data platform that maintains uh
51:33 data warehouse and
51:35 infra
51:36 kafka cluster right
51:39 okay now you have a lot of user and you
51:41 want to build the framework like dbt to
51:44 enable people to do you know
51:47 sql execute sql uh in a production
51:50 manner so like what dbt does so it's an
51:53 open source project okay it's available
51:55 but let's say you have to build this
51:56 thing in the house it doesn't exist
51:58 it's going to be a dedicated team right
52:00 you cannot manage to do it in our house
52:02 plus that at the same time so you scope
52:05 will go down so you're more going to
52:07 from like a sql i mean access management
52:11 uh
52:12 role to like really proper developing a
52:14 service that involves different set of
52:17 technology same thing for streaming
52:19 right okay now we involve into streaming
52:21 so
52:22 you
52:23 based on the project and how the things
52:25 are going to grow if you're gonna be
52:27 scoped down and be more niche uh we were
52:30 talking about you know google doc
52:32 comment features
52:34 i think you need to have specific skill
52:36 sets
52:37 uh like real time you know websocket and
52:40 so on for those kind of
52:42 team
52:44 and and yeah and so you're going to
52:46 build a certain profile
52:49 base basically on project that's going
52:50 to come over that's like what i would
52:53 say roughly
52:55 yeah also at the beginning i mentioned
52:57 that there are different kinds of data
52:59 engineers so one
53:01 type of data engineers work
53:03 where they work on platforms and the
53:05 other work
53:07 works more on the use cases so the
53:09 question that we have here is what is
53:11 the ratio between uh racial work between
53:15 platform building and use case pipelines
53:21 so really good question again depending
53:23 on the size of your company
53:26 i would say like like if you're a small
53:28 startup
53:29 uh but let's say yeah in the scale up in
53:31 the context of the scale up
53:33 uh
53:34 i would say
53:36 um
53:37 50 50 because
53:39 you're gonna build as much pipeline as
53:41 features that you're gonna
53:44 develop to
53:45 ease the development of this pipeline
53:48 um so
53:50 um so yeah they're gonna be a lot of
53:53 requests that's similar basically right
53:56 and uh and you need to build frameworks
53:59 to you know
54:00 build something generic around it so
54:02 that's more of the data platform
54:05 um
54:06 but yes i would say i would say 50 50 in
54:08 general
54:10 so you start getting requests and then
54:12 you see
54:13 if there is any pattern and then for
54:15 those
54:16 when there is a pattern you kind of
54:18 build
54:18 a solution for this so then these people
54:21 can like i don't know those who require
54:24 um who request these things they will
54:26 just be able to solve
54:28 exactly
54:30 okay
54:32 what would you say is the most important
54:34 attribute for a data engineer who
54:36 wants to get promoted from mid-level
54:38 role to a senior role
54:44 i think in
54:46 a good way to
54:52 to uh yeah you you can so there is um i
54:55 think you need to be more proactive as
54:58 uh so i think in as a mid engineer
55:00 you're basically solving problem really
55:03 for your team right
55:06 and as in the senior you're stepping
55:08 back and you're looking what's like the
55:11 you know the next team next to you like
55:14 what i mean by that it's like
55:16 the closest team in term of data
55:18 platform or you know users and
55:21 and have projects start to have thinking
55:24 okay
55:26 you have uh
55:28 you need to do something to to help two
55:30 team for example my team and another one
55:33 and then it's the same thing for staff
55:34 like when you get stuff it's like more
55:36 at the you know the whole engineering
55:38 scope
55:39 okay how do i have a project that you
55:42 know solve issue that has that is
55:44 present on the all engineering
55:47 teams so the i would say that the more
55:49 you grow the bigger the impact you
55:52 should have and so basically
55:54 as a mindset you should always like kind
55:56 of a step back from you know your ticket
55:59 and what you have in the backlog and say
56:01 okay why are we doing this right what's
56:03 what's the problem go talk with people
56:05 from
56:06 other teams uh book a chat i think it's
56:09 way harder now in regards for me at
56:12 least before i just you know i got to
56:14 the coffee machine and i learned stuff
56:16 um but book intentionally stuff to say
56:19 hey i just want to
56:21 to chat uh informally like uh what have
56:24 you been up to and maybe you're gonna
56:26 you know see oh there is something to to
56:29 do i think uh
56:31 yeah
56:33 yep are you looking for a band somebody
56:36 is interested if uh
56:38 if you are because they appear it
56:40 appears they need a bass guitar player a
56:43 bass guitar player no i'm not i have my
56:45 own project and i've been putting that
56:47 side
56:48 but
56:49 yeah
56:50 but i think they want to have somebody
56:53 who is both a date engineer and a bus
56:55 guitar player
56:58 yes so maybe yeah i don't know
57:01 i don't i don't have any
57:03 time for that
57:04 how many caps do you have
57:07 uh
57:09 is that like is that your question or is
57:11 it a question okay this is mine
57:13 okay because uh i was
57:16 i was thinking maybe there is some uh
57:18 colleagues trolling me because it's a
57:20 common question
57:21 no the okay say a number say a number
57:24 i'll say lower or higher
57:26 100
57:28 now lower
57:30 okay i'll disappoint
57:35 20
57:37 um
57:39 still a bit lower
57:40 okay okay we stopped that we stopped
57:42 there we stopped there i want to leave
57:44 the you know
57:47 okay yeah actually i wanted to talk
57:48 about your channel but then we have
57:50 quite a few questions so i wanted to
57:52 cover them
57:53 too so tell us
57:55 about your channel
57:57 yeah um
57:59 so
57:59 [Music]
58:01 it's uh it's a channel about data
58:04 engineering mostly i mean also coding i
58:06 mean any software engineer is welcome
58:08 right i think
58:10 data engineer
58:11 they are software engineering at first
58:13 so it's mostly me sharing uh whatever i
58:16 can about my experience around data
58:19 scope
58:20 um how and i have now i put like a
58:24 data engineer roadmap as project so like
58:27 roadmap with a specific project
58:30 so
58:31 um and i'll be showcasing those projects
58:34 so really my intention there it's just
58:36 like um
58:38 sharing my knowledge and get feedback
58:40 again so when people are coming back to
58:42 me say hi
58:43 uh maybe you did that wrong or
58:45 um
58:46 and so uh so yeah that's like the
58:49 channel it's called meteo data tv
58:52 i also have a podcast now
58:54 uh which is called datacreators.club
58:57 which is also on uh the youtube channel
59:01 um and there is links on spotify and so
59:03 on and datacreators.club is the website
59:06 i've done to find um
59:10 data mentors right so you can search any
59:12 data mentors
59:14 on any channel youtube linkedin medium
59:17 it's a pretty simple website but it gets
59:20 a lot of traction
59:22 so yeah i guess it's me just learning
59:25 from people and putting a list of those
59:27 you are of course inside at least
59:31 and uh and yeah and that's mostly like
59:33 uh where i'm active like and on the
59:35 writing i'm using medium and linkedin
59:39 to write
59:41 how much time do you spend on creating a
59:43 video because when i look at this it's
59:46 amazingly high quality videos and i know
59:49 that there are other creators and they
59:51 have an entire team actually to do this
59:53 um yeah but
59:55 so i i i don't have a team i'm cloning
59:57 myself right i have this one if we can
1:00:00 like it's two people right
1:00:03 but
1:00:04 for those who are just listening and not
1:00:06 seeing video you're pointing at uh
1:00:11 darth vader yeah exactly sorry
1:00:14 um
1:00:15 you know so
1:00:16 uh i definitely spent too much time at
1:00:18 the moment i'm still figuring out the
1:00:20 process i started in december with like
1:00:23 roughly
1:00:24 one video months taking a lot of time
1:00:27 i'm getting better like the first video
1:00:29 it literally took me two months like
1:00:31 because you don't know what the you know
1:00:33 like the banner creating a youtube
1:00:35 channel the intro the outro
1:00:39 um i think uh
1:00:41 it takes me more time to produce content
1:00:43 i don't have the flying wheel yet
1:00:45 because my expectation in production are
1:00:48 high so it's not really a good thing
1:00:50 because you were mentioning all the
1:00:51 quality is good but i maybe i don't
1:00:53 spend enough some time
1:00:56 you know time on the core content
1:00:58 but i believe i will have you know when
1:01:01 my process will be figured out right
1:01:04 then like okay now i can pull a high
1:01:06 quality video in less time so i can
1:01:08 spend more time on the content so the
1:01:10 point don't be discouraged if anyone is
1:01:13 listening
1:01:14 i want to go on youtube channel you just
1:01:17 need today a smartphone and you're good
1:01:19 to go as long as you have a good story
1:01:22 to tell
1:01:23 but for me it's definitely taking too
1:01:26 much time at the moment still
1:01:28 getting into the process to to lower
1:01:30 that
1:01:30 and get to
1:01:32 a right pace
1:01:34 and you mentioned cloning yourself and i
1:01:35 think in one of the videos was it about
1:01:37 the different types of data engineers
1:01:39 yeah yeah
1:01:40 there was actually three
1:01:42 yeah there was three of you yeah yeah
1:01:45 i know we should be wrapping up i don't
1:01:48 know if you need to go somewhere
1:01:51 a uh but
1:01:51 minutes that's that's fine
1:01:54 how did you do this
1:01:56 uh
1:01:57 you filmed you filmed like three
1:01:59 different things and then you kind of
1:02:00 stitched it through yeah that's as
1:02:02 simple as that so the only thing you
1:02:04 need to really to pay attention it's
1:02:06 just a setup is the light the light need
1:02:08 to be constant because if you have a
1:02:11 shadow that's coming over it and when
1:02:13 you're gonna cut you know each piece
1:02:14 you're gonna see a dark one and so
1:02:16 you're gonna see where the video is
1:02:19 being cut uh this is the only thing it's
1:02:21 like a simple trick there there is a lot
1:02:24 of trick which is way more simple than
1:02:26 people think it's just uh
1:02:28 doing some research on youtube and uh
1:02:32 you know figure that out um i love doing
