0:58 or you don't need this list yeah
1:02 go ahead okay
1:04 you ready to start yeah yeah
1:07 okay so this week we'll talk about
1:11 doing data engineering as a remote
1:13 worker among other things and we have a
1:16 special guest today Jose is a computer
1:19 scientist who is currently focused who's
1:23 currently focusing on data engineering
1:24 and previously he worked in different
1:26 fields like software engineering
1:28 background engineering
1:29 he liked writing and he's in charge of a
1:33 data engineering newsletter but he will
1:35 tell us more about it during the
1:36 interview so welcome to the show Jose
1:38 yeah thank you so much I'm very happy to
1:41 be here
1:43 um as always the questions for today's
1:45 interview are prepared by Johanna Bayer
1:48 thanks Johanna for your help
1:49 so before we start before we go into our
1:53 main topic of doing data engineering
1:55 remotely and other things let's start
1:58 with your background can you tell us
2:00 about your career Journey so far yeah
2:02 yeah sure
2:04 um I studied a computer science degree
2:07 in in Spain
2:10 and I work
2:13 in several Spanish companies and
2:18 and the last year I worked in I'm
2:22 working in Norway and living in Norway
2:25 as well so yeah
2:29 um it's a quick uh introduction
2:34 well that's quite a change from Spain to
2:37 Norway
2:38 right from uh like very hot weather to
2:42 more cold yeah let's uh right now it's
2:47 quite good because now in Spain is
2:50 almost 45 degrees
2:54 and it's kind of very hot and right now
2:57 we have I think almost 20 degrees
3:03 I see the benefits right now have you
3:07 seen the northern north northern lights
3:10 yet or yes yes I I saw them amazing
3:14 amazing you need to send some pictures
3:17 yeah that's a dream of mine too
3:21 to see them which city are you in right
3:23 now uh right now I'm living in drastic
3:26 it's a quite a small village
3:31 um this week I'm moving to Budu
3:34 which is uh
3:38 middle north of Norway
3:42 so yeah
3:45 oh
3:48 Alex say hello
3:57 are you there
4:00 people
4:02 hello
4:04 hello I think I'm back
4:06 okay I hope I hope I'm back
4:09 um yeah German internet is not Stables
4:13 internet in the world unfortunately
4:16 um no from here
4:19 okay how did you end up how did you end
4:23 up in Norway what's the story like did
4:25 you just find a job there and relocated
4:27 or you specifically wanted to go to
4:29 Norway you know in fact I we moved here
4:33 because of my partner she had a cigar
4:38 tab
4:39 big
4:40 interesting offer to work here
4:44 so yeah we decided we decided to to move
4:47 here because both of us none of us
4:52 live outside Spain so it's a good
4:57 opportunity and we are here
5:00 so you work remotely currently right so
5:03 you live in a village
5:06 your job your employer is also based in
5:09 Norway but you work remotely
5:11 so how does your
5:14 how is your day organized like how do
5:16 you do this
5:18 yeah most of the most of the days it's
5:22 um
5:23 it's the same but it depends on uh on
5:28 the as working hours of my partner
5:30 honestly
5:34 no working hours is specific working
5:38 hours so
5:39 uh yeah most of the days I have
5:44 four five
5:46 two blocks of uh three four hours
5:52 uh and this word these blocks are
5:56 splitted somehow
5:59 depends on on where things are going in
6:03 the day
6:08 okay so do you have two blocks of three
6:11 four hours and like you put just you put
6:15 them
6:16 in some slots right depending on the
6:18 availability of your partner which is
6:20 not available or when she's working
6:22 right so maybe
6:24 like how strict is your schedule maybe
6:27 like do you always work at the same time
6:29 or sometimes you work at night sometimes
6:30 a day uh right now it's kind of it's
6:35 very stable I may start working
6:39 at 7 00 am
6:42 and yeah the first block is for from 7
6:48 to 8 11 or less and the second one
6:52 usually goes
6:55 after that
6:57 I have a little break too
7:00 yes
7:01 right now
7:04 so you don't have a long siesta
7:17 why
7:18 because
7:22 um
7:22 it's good for me
7:24 and to not just working just right after
7:29 waking up
7:32 so I have uh I need some
7:35 time to wake up and warping up
7:41 and it's I work there first
7:45 um the first thing I I do it's going out
7:49 going out and having a work
7:53 okay
7:56 so was it um like when you found this
7:58 job was it already remote first or you
8:02 had to do if you had to somehow
8:04 negotiate this in your contract that
8:06 yeah you will not be able to come to the
8:08 office so you will live in a remote
8:10 Village and you will only work online
8:13 yeah
8:15 um I did not negotiate the the remote
8:19 position because the offer of my partner
8:23 was
8:25 work
8:26 in several months
8:29 or seminar month so we leave three
8:33 months here one in one place and after
8:35 three we are leaving six more in another
8:40 place
8:42 so yeah the first
8:46 yeah my first requirement was working
8:50 remotely
8:52 and
8:53 funny
8:54 funny things it was
8:57 it was hard to find a job
9:00 in Norway for remote
9:05 uh but I
9:08 finally got it
9:11 so I usually I have no knowledge
9:15 whatsoever about the job market in a way
9:18 um
9:21 what's usually like what kind of
9:24 companies are hiring there like do you
9:26 have like typical big tech companies
9:29 there like I don't know Microsoft Google
9:33 um and the likes or it's more like just
9:37 Norwegian companies yeah it's more
9:39 norwinian companies
9:42 or like yeah they I don't really know if
9:46 Microsoft or Google are here
9:50 but uh yeah most of the companies are
9:54 novenian
9:56 can you tell us what you do
9:59 right now
10:01 I'm working as
10:05 software engineer
10:07 focus on iot
10:10 platforms
10:12 and yeah handling all the
10:17 the current platform which is in the in
10:22 progress right now
10:24 and I'm heading the project I mean yeah
10:29 we we are two so
10:32 we have no so much possibilities
10:37 into in what area is the like what
10:41 exactly the company
10:42 [Music]
10:46 it's uh
10:49 mechanical industry I don't know if it's
10:52 the
10:53 specific area
10:56 but they
10:58 they usually
11:01 um
11:02 bill
11:03 big
11:05 big platforms like fishing I don't know
11:09 the name in English either
11:12 fishing tanks in the middle of the fury
11:16 and told this kind of things
11:23 I was I was kind of thinking like is it
11:25 related to fish to fish and fishing
11:27 because like all I know about Norway
11:30 I might have a very
11:33 close-minded and short-sighted view of
11:35 Norway but usually I know it by
11:39 you know fish because like every time I
11:42 go to a store I see Fish from Norway and
11:44 my impression of that it was like okay
11:47 probably it's mostly fishing there and
11:51 what do you do is also related to that
11:53 right yeah
11:55 but it's the not the
11:59 food area it's more like than in the
12:03 industry
12:04 okay so you produce some stuff that is
12:08 later needed for fishing
12:11 I see and I assume that there are some
12:13 sensors and whatnot and your job as a
12:16 data engineer software engineer to
12:18 collect data from these sensors correct
12:21 yes
12:22 mm-hmm again you are building some sort
12:26 of a platform for making it easier to
12:28 collect the data
12:30 yeah how the essential Rock are
12:34 currently we are developing kind of
12:38 oblasty in system for all of this
12:42 sorry my I stopped hearing you because
12:45 uh
12:47 yeah I don't know my
12:50 headphones stopped working okay can you
12:52 say it again yes
12:54 um
12:56 currently we are developing
12:59 um the kind of operating system for all
13:03 of the projects
13:05 so how all these things
13:08 store and how all the data come from and
13:12 Contour so
13:17 okay and um
13:19 so I see that we already have a few
13:21 questions and one of the questions is
13:24 um why was it so difficult to find a
13:27 remote job in Norway because it seems
13:30 like
13:30 um
13:32 for technical fields for a technical
13:34 field
13:34 [Music]
13:35 after covet especially like there are
13:38 plenty of options yeah I thought that
13:41 but the point here it's most of the
13:45 companies I got the interview and I cut
13:49 the the conversation they always wanted
13:54 to want me to be at least one time one
13:59 day the week in the office
14:02 so it will be
14:05 it wasn't
14:07 possible for me
14:12 okay yeah yeah
14:14 for for me it was kind of difficult to
14:18 find a job because my thoughts were okay
14:22 after pandemic situation after Norway
14:27 it's big it's a big country it's
14:30 very big and the village and the cities
14:34 are very
14:36 [Music]
14:37 um
14:38 they have very distance
14:41 so it's it's the place to work remotely
14:44 but it's it's not
14:48 and probably most of the companies are
14:50 in osloor
14:51 yeah
14:53 the big cities
14:57 okay so what you need to do is to find a
15:00 company that did not require you to go
15:02 to the office and there were not so many
15:05 options right no
15:07 and what about companies that are not
15:09 Norway based
15:12 uh
15:14 yeah I didn't have the opportunity to go
15:17 there because I thought I found the the
15:20 job
15:23 kind of not early because it took three
15:26 months
15:28 but yeah so
15:32 how do your usual daily activities look
15:36 like can you share some challenges
15:40 of working remotely as a data engineer
15:43 well uh the first one I think the
15:47 loneliness
15:49 of working alone
15:51 and
15:54 yeah because we are I'm
15:58 alone in my house
16:00 and it's kind of difficult to react
16:05 people who are not so
16:09 um
16:11 used to work them only because my my
16:15 company was kind of okay
16:18 you have you you are able to program
16:21 only but
16:23 um they this is not the the first uh or
16:27 the core
16:29 of the business so yeah the the my
16:33 colleges he's in German in Germany so
16:38 yeah the big one of the biggest
16:42 the loneliness I guess
16:45 how what do you do to
16:47 overcome this hitting
16:50 yeah trying to uh
16:53 [Music]
16:55 it's kind of difficult
16:57 is try to not think so much about it it
17:01 just work
17:04 well when you don't think about like
17:07 what they say like don't think about
17:09 orange elephant and then all you can
17:11 think about is yeah yeah
17:14 I think the phrase is a little bit
17:16 different I don't remember the exact
17:18 wording but like if you just
17:20 try not to think about this uh it will
17:22 come back do you do anything else like I
17:25 don't know trying to
17:27 assume in a village there are not so
17:29 many
17:29 things happening like there are not
17:31 meetups that you can join right
17:33 yeah we don't know uh I like living like
17:37 this
17:38 I think
17:42 um it's not for everyone
17:44 because yeah I love being alone I really
17:49 like I really like the the feeling
17:52 but I know that this feeling is not for
17:56 everyone
17:58 okay so it's a challenge but on the
18:00 other hand you kind of take advantage of
18:03 this and yeah absolutely yeah
18:06 do you have other challenges in your
18:09 work
18:10 it does not have to be related to
18:12 working remotely but maybe like uh just
18:15 your work
18:17 um yeah one of the other challenge is
18:20 living and working in the same area
18:25 yeah uh I usually
18:29 um I found out this when I was in in
18:32 Spain working remotely as well
18:35 it was my house was the my my living
18:38 room was the same as work
18:42 as for work for living room so it's
18:45 difficult to okay I'm just stopped
18:49 working and so that the the laptop I'm
18:53 here
18:54 uh it's kind of difficult to to switch
18:58 because it's the same space
19:01 uh yeah that's a big one
19:05 tenant
19:06 yeah I understand what you mean well
19:09 probably most of us understand like when
19:11 during covet we had to work remotely and
19:14 then like leaving and work in the same
19:16 space I was very happy to actually come
19:18 back to those but I know many people
19:20 have different opinions about going to
19:23 the office because like you have you can
19:25 have you can save so much time on not
19:28 Community right you just wake up do your
19:30 stuff then open your laptop work
19:33 finish your work close your laptop and
19:36 then you have like I don't know one hour
19:38 more in your day yeah absolutely
19:43 any other challenges
19:45 yeah
19:47 yeah right now following the the last
19:50 one was I usually try to split
19:55 the space
19:57 yeah it's a good approach
20:00 to to kind of
20:04 um
20:05 I'll no no that
20:08 um
20:08 you know prevent this situation it's
20:11 okay I have one room and the living room
20:15 so I I only have to work there here so
20:19 kind of trying to block one space in the
20:24 living room
20:25 and this base is only for work
20:31 and what about
20:33 challenges of your actual work
20:37 um like I mentioned that you need to
20:38 deal with a lot of data because like iot
20:41 data from what I know usually like you
20:45 have
20:45 in large volumes you have a lot of data
20:48 coming from the sensors all right
20:51 um so what are the some challenges that
20:54 are related to
20:56 your work as a data engineer
21:00 e and dealing with this sort of data
21:04 well first of all uh I think
21:07 [Music]
21:11 not being in the same place where all
21:16 the
21:17 permits the the first was the first one
21:20 was not being in the same place as the
21:24 sensor and the data come from it's kind
21:27 of difficult to explain that
21:30 yeah because all my previous
21:34 um
21:35 my previous Works uh worked where okay
21:39 just software engineering so I just
21:42 developed something and okay and it's
21:44 kind of abstract
21:47 uh
21:48 but the iot it's okay we have this
21:52 sensor which is connected to a I don't
21:55 know the temperature of or it's a belt
22:02 so yeah this data coming from decent
22:06 Gene and okay
22:08 yeah you said that this data come from
22:12 the engine but I don't know I I cannot
22:16 see this kind of
22:20 electrical I don't know if it's called
22:22 electric it's in the manual
22:25 uh the physical thing
22:29 it's kind of difficult to explain though
22:32 uh so from what I understood maybe I'm
22:34 not um right so what do you mean is like
22:38 the thing the engine with all the
22:41 sensors is somehow is somewhere there
22:44 like you don't have access to this and
22:47 what would help for you to actually go
22:49 there and see where the sensor is placed
22:51 how exactly they dictate is generated so
22:53 then you have more understanding of
22:57 like how exactly this data is created
23:00 how it's captured right it would help
23:02 you
23:03 as a data engineer to understand better
23:07 the data and then process is better
23:08 right yeah
23:12 um
23:13 I why would we actually need that I'm
23:16 just thinking like okay there is some
23:18 sensor you can conceptually visualize
23:20 there's an engine and then there is like
23:22 a tiny thing connected to it that sends
23:25 data
23:26 I took the problem yeah no problem but
23:30 for me it was
23:33 difficult yeah and it was a challenge
23:36 for me
23:38 so yeah I guess being on site and seeing
23:41 how exactly this is a working helps to
23:44 yeah just because it was mine right now
23:46 I
23:48 I'm comfortable with it but at the first
23:51 time it was okay
23:54 another correlated with the same as I
23:59 did before
24:04 let's see
24:06 um
24:07 and yeah maybe we can talk about uh
24:10 General data engineering because I know
24:12 that you have a newsletter
24:13 and you have a website and we have
24:16 checked your website and one of the
24:18 things that you mentioned there
24:21 is that if you have some data and or
24:25 streams of data
24:26 and you just capture this data you just
24:29 save it
24:30 and you don't know necessarily what to
24:34 do with this data so you just store it
24:36 and you say that you can show how to
24:39 turn this data from just
24:42 what you call mere pepper weight like uh
24:47 something that just you keep there to a
24:51 major asset in your business
24:53 so this is a very loaded sentence and
24:57 it's very interesting so how do you turn
25:00 data that is just out there you just
25:02 keep it you don't do anything with this
25:05 choose something that is useful
25:07 yeah uh
25:10 the first thing it's to understand the
25:15 business of the
25:17 okay
25:21 what are you doing
25:24 okay why are you storing this data
25:28 it's just for being a big database
25:33 or uh do this data is coming from a big
25:40 part of the or my main part of the
25:43 business and after that
25:46 in one
25:51 after understand
25:53 understanding that the business it's I'm
25:57 able kind of
26:00 um
26:01 to do this
26:05 transforms and all these things
26:08 I don't know how to explain that
26:11 actually
26:13 but you probably explain it in your
26:16 newsletter right yeah
26:21 okay
26:22 um
26:25 [Music]
26:28 I'm just thinking what the like what
26:31 kind of follow-up question I can ask uh
26:34 so well you figure out I guess it's
26:36 related to The Challenge you mentioned
26:38 as you said that like for you it's
26:40 important to see where the sensors are
26:42 placed so you want to understand the
26:45 data better right and this is what you
26:48 need to do like if you have to do your
26:50 data stored in the database the first
26:52 step you need to do is understand like
26:54 how exactly this data is created right
26:56 or what's the
26:59 what's the idea behind this data like
27:01 what what does it mean right and can you
27:05 do it with any data or what do you even
27:10 why do you even capture this data in the
27:12 first place like to do we need to
27:14 capture all the data that is out there
27:16 or maybe first we need to understand
27:17 what we want to do with this data and
27:19 then only then saved yeah I think we
27:22 first need to understand
27:25 and not all the data as are usually
27:29 uh Worthy
27:34 okay so let's say we have some data sets
27:39 right some bunch of data that we store
27:41 we think it's useful we start keeping it
27:44 and it's been there and we think yeah
27:47 let's make use of this data
27:50 um what do we do next with it with this
27:52 data
27:54 I I will try to explode it
27:58 and yeah see the
28:01 what
28:03 information are there uh
28:07 the the
28:08 features and all these things I don't
28:13 know I'm really bad at naming so I think
28:16 it's the ETL uh process
28:20 to to find
28:22 what is inside the data
28:27 but you probably also need to have some
28:29 sort of business case in mind right like
28:31 why exactly you create this detail
28:34 hmm
28:36 yeah that's the point of uh understand
28:40 first the the business point
28:45 okay and then you just create a pipeline
28:47 an ETL and that that's it you call it a
28:50 day and uh
28:52 I don't know like is there anything uh
28:56 um
28:58 I don't know how do you organize your
29:00 work with stakeholders for example to to
29:03 show that okay like here's the data set
29:05 uh here's some data here's our business
29:09 understanding of this data here's our
29:11 goal we create some Pipeline and then
29:13 like what do we do next like how do we
29:15 show the results to the stakeholders
29:18 yeah honestly I don't know
29:21 I don't know uh because
29:24 um I'm right now in the process of being
29:29 there
29:30 I'm not call myself as data engineer
29:35 because it's not this
29:37 as I I do but it's I don't know how to
29:42 explain that
29:43 because I'm not working right now with
29:46 clients and stakeholders because it's
29:48 not I'm not working with them
29:52 so I have no right now I have no uh this
29:58 process human too
30:00 who do you work with like you you
30:03 mentioned you have like a leak in
30:05 Germany but you probably
30:07 when you create your pipelines when you
30:09 create this platform somebody needs to
30:11 use a thread
30:15 okay uh okay
30:21 hello okay
30:24 I'm back I'm back I guess
30:28 yeah
30:29 um so what I was saying is like you and
30:31 your colleague from Germany you create a
30:33 platform right so you somehow process
30:35 this data and then this thought platform
30:37 is for somebody right somebody needs to
30:39 use it and so these are I guess your
30:41 stakeholders
30:43 yeah
30:44 um our stakeholder right now it's uh the
30:47 other college and
30:50 in the company with the who is the
30:54 responsible for putting and connect all
30:58 the sensors right now it's the this is
31:00 the process
31:01 important process yeah
31:04 okay can you walk us through this
31:05 process so let's say like I don't know
31:08 there's a new machine and you want to
31:10 start collecting data from this machine
31:12 like what exactly what exactly is
31:15 happening after that you decide okay we
31:18 need to start collecting this data
31:20 okay uh yeah the first thing it's
31:24 um we start I don't know if it's a start
31:28 it's uh connected at the sensor
31:31 and after that once it is connected
31:37 my college has to register this sensor
31:42 to the system
31:45 and all the the system is
31:48 able to collect the data and process and
31:52 just uh
31:54 yeah just processing the data it's not
31:57 the storing the data right now it's a
31:58 real time
32:01 so yeah this is the process right now I
32:05 I said that it's the AC in progress so
32:10 that's their point right now the status
32:15 I see so
32:18 can you tell us what did you write about
32:21 in your latest newsletter issue
32:25 yeah uh not uh
32:28 not technical information honestly
32:32 uh yeah it's more how can we
32:37 um
32:39 or can we use uh data
32:43 for uh for business
32:45 uh yeah because it I don't know
32:50 the main purpose of the newsletter it's
32:54 to show without being technical person
32:59 how can
33:01 get how can we get the information and
33:07 profit for from data
33:12 hmm
33:14 and so
33:17 how did you actually how did this idea
33:19 of starting a newsletter occur to you
33:22 if
33:26 the idea was okay I'm
33:30 a very technical person and I
33:34 uh I don't like people
33:37 honestly I it's very difficult for me to
33:41 speak with uh to speak with other people
33:45 and to speak with stakeholders as well
33:48 explain
33:51 um technical information for people who
33:55 has no technical so the the
33:58 point was okay
34:00 I like writing I
34:03 kind of trying to explain that in
34:07 writing but it's not it's easier for me
34:11 than talking
34:14 okay
34:15 so for you like being on this podcast is
34:17 already quite uh quite Anonymous that's
34:21 quite a challenge like what I mean maybe
34:23 achievement is not the right word but
34:25 for you as somebody
34:27 no
34:30 it's difficult to speak with people yeah
34:32 you prefer writing thinking like sitting
34:34 down thinking first about what you want
34:37 to write about and then structuring the
34:39 material right and then
34:41 yeah explaining it right I see okay well
34:44 thanks for being here
34:47 uh I understand now that uh
34:50 yeah it's uh I imagine that there are
34:52 many people like you like it's probably
34:57 um
34:59 we call them introverts right so I'm
35:01 also an introvert
35:03 um
35:04 and uh yeah sometimes it's
35:07 um
35:08 you know hard to be around people all
35:10 the time and you need to uh in your case
35:13 you decided to go to a Norwegian Village
35:15 there maybe it's a little bit extreme
35:20 uh yeah
35:22 um
35:23 so you decided to start the newsletter
35:25 to take time to
35:28 put your thoughts
35:30 uh into writing and explain how exactly
35:34 to work with people right or to work
35:37 with stakeholders how to make use of
35:39 data
35:40 [Music]
35:41 how do you come up with the suggestions
35:44 with the tips that you provide do you
35:47 get Inspirations from inspiration from
35:49 your work
35:50 or
35:52 from the internet from social media or
35:57 yeah it's everywhere
35:59 when one thing I had in mind I have in
36:04 mind all the time it's okay all what is
36:07 going on around me can be a big
36:11 or can be a anime because the the key
36:15 point of the email is not just
36:20 um
36:21 for data itself it's more like
36:25 entertainment
36:27 it's uh he also I work in outside and
36:33 just see I don't know right now but
36:37 it's kind of I get the inspiration from
36:40 I don't know a rock in the middle of the
36:43 pure
36:44 and okay I kind of I can
36:49 I want to explain that situation somehow
36:53 that it's interesting for other people
36:56 and yeah trying to
37:00 [Music]
37:00 um
37:02 try to
37:04 combat or switch this history or story
37:09 for uh
37:11 into the data business on the data world
37:15 you know what I mean
37:18 [Laughter]
37:22 so you get Inspirations from everywhere
37:24 and then
37:26 like I say okay this should be
37:28 interesting this must be interesting for
37:29 people let me try to work it out and put
37:32 it in writing
37:35 yeah maybe it's a
37:38 just uh thing that just happened to me
37:42 okay that I feel I don't know I feel
37:47 copy I feel sad wherever it's okay
37:50 trying to
37:52 to explain that how we can take
37:55 advantage for for it in all all
38:01 uh around the data world
38:04 which is kind of difficult but
38:11 so you work remotely and
38:16 I am wondering so this newsletter that
38:19 you have do you think it helps you
38:22 uh to put yourself out there to
38:28 um and maybe get attention
38:30 um
38:32 to get more opportunities as a remote
38:33 worker
38:34 uh
38:36 I think so
38:38 I think so it's uh because
38:42 um one of the advantage has that the
38:46 administrator has is the rep
38:49 repetition
38:51 so every day I write an email and my
38:55 audience
38:56 receive this email so it's
39:00 with red Edition we have
39:03 we have confidence
39:06 so the big challenge is to get people
39:11 into the the newsletter
39:18 okay so you need to do you do it
39:21 consistently you do it every day right
39:23 now yeah daily yeah
39:27 must be quite difficult to come up with
39:29 content every day
39:31 is it not
39:34 um kind of but it depends because most
39:38 of the days I write the email but it's
39:43 not just one email maybe it's an idea
39:47 and I have some ideas and I write for
39:52 email so yeah
39:55 they'd step in like
39:58 okay so what you're saying is sometimes
40:01 like you have an idea but you kind of
40:04 split it into multiple days and then you
40:06 start and then like on the second day
40:08 you continue continue until my queue
40:11 work it out and then you get another
40:14 idea and you start writing about that
40:16 too yeah it's yeah it depends
40:20 and one of the things that I remember
40:23 from the covet times
40:26 is this feeling of
40:29 um a burnout like when there are so many
40:32 things happening uh
40:34 like around the house and then like at
40:37 work and everyone wants meetings and
40:40 like there is uh I need to reply to
40:42 emails and then on top of that like if I
40:45 also had to write an
40:47 newsletter every day I would probably go
40:49 crazy so how do you do you first maybe
40:52 do you even have this feeling of
40:56 of a burnout sometimes and if you do
40:59 like how do you what do you do to
41:02 um
41:02 to overcome it
41:04 uh
41:06 uh one thing it's going out
41:11 uh here in I'm in the middle I'm living
41:15 in the middle of the floor
41:17 so I go just got out to the nature and
41:22 it helps a lot
41:25 really helps
41:29 um yeah other things
41:32 to exercise
41:34 which is very important to
41:39 try not to think
41:42 about work
41:44 um
41:45 and yeah that's uh the two things
41:49 previously in Spain he also worked
41:52 remote right
41:53 was it also a village or it was a city
41:57 uh in the pandemic it was in Barcelona
42:03 [Music]
42:05 I lived in a small
42:08 [Music]
42:11 it was is
42:13 it's not a village it's a small City
42:19 because not everyone unfortunately not
42:22 everyone has access to Nature yeah lives
42:25 in a Norwegian Village and can just go
42:29 out and enjoy like all these Lakes
42:31 mountains forests and I saw some I saw
42:35 pictures from Norway and all of them are
42:37 so amazing and I'm kind of envious that
42:39 you can just you know close your laptop
42:43 uh leave your house leave your apartment
42:45 and then enjoy all that but not every
42:48 one of us has access to this yeah let's
42:50 say if you leave in Barcelona like you
42:53 don't have nature really right so what
42:55 do you do there just go for it yeah
42:59 going for a walk and yeah in Barcelona
43:02 was there is the beach
43:05 so it helps out right right and yeah I I
43:11 always try to to leave or to go
43:16 near to the nature
43:19 it's uh well one thing he mentioned is
43:22 uh doing some
43:25 activities like sport access sport
43:27 activities for example and I remember
43:29 like okay I'm already busy like there
43:32 are so many things happening
43:33 how can I squeeze in
43:36 Sports yeah like what's your
43:39 um
43:40 uh the first thing is
43:44 um I usually do it the first thing in
43:47 the morning
43:48 so because okay I try to prioritize me
43:54 before uh something else
43:59 so my
44:02 I try to to do this
44:05 the first thing in the morning just
44:07 waking up and going
44:10 out right now having a work
44:14 yeah
44:16 let's uh yeah I just
44:20 realized it
44:22 because
44:25 these three years
44:27 was okay I just waking up and we started
44:31 working and had the burnout and it's
44:34 kind of difficult to
44:36 uh
44:37 to yet escape from it but right now I
44:42 need I
44:44 I think I found out uh
44:48 for me the the where it works so
44:51 everyone moved to a Norwegian Village
44:56 know everyone because
44:58 yeah as you said it's not for everyone
45:01 right so like if it's difficult to be
45:04 alone right and then there is not so
45:06 much so many social activities that you
45:08 can do outside of work too right
45:11 just curious like do people in villages
45:14 speak English in a region religious
45:17 speak English or you need to
45:19 know which usually they they know uh
45:24 English they speak in English but they
45:27 usually speak in Romanian so I speak
45:30 norwegianally Abby
45:32 so yeah
45:35 most of the times
45:39 we speak in Armenian but the norwinian
45:43 people when just I just we just
45:48 um
45:49 speak
45:52 like it was okay I'm trying to speak in
45:55 Armenian but you would just turn to
45:58 English because it's easier for you and
46:01 it's it's easier for me but I'm kind of
46:06 um I try to improve my intervarian
46:09 sometimes so okay no no we're speaking
46:12 Romanian so it's no problem
46:16 [Music]
46:17 as much as possible that's cool because
46:20 like I've spent so much time in Germany
46:23 and still because like everyone speaks
46:25 English I
46:27 use English most of the time even though
46:30 like technically I know some German too
46:34 get around I still just you know use
46:36 English
46:39 okay
46:40 um well I see that we have quite a few
46:43 questions I want to go back to these
46:45 questions and uh we still have some time
46:48 to cover them
46:50 so the first question I see is which
46:52 websites will you suggest
46:55 to
46:56 to to use to find remote work for
46:59 beginners for somebody who is just
47:01 starting their career
47:03 well
47:04 uh
47:06 here in Norway it's uh there is a
47:11 website which you can find all
47:15 and
47:16 right now I'm using this
47:19 here
47:20 it's fin don't know
47:23 okay so for those who do not live in
47:26 Norway it's probably not very relevant
47:28 uh no
47:31 that's uh did LinkedIn work for you for
47:35 this case or you had to use this one
47:37 yeah
47:38 it it worked
47:41 it works sometimes I think I know uh it
47:47 was I'm really bad at naming at work
47:50 there is a platform I guess it's a
47:54 website
47:56 viewer I think it's only one
48:00 but yeah
48:02 that's it well if you're in Norway then
48:06 it's for that website I think you said
48:08 fine.no and uh yes h f
48:13 I
48:14 n n
48:17 okay then it's a fine in norwinian so
48:21 let's see
48:24 so then the other question we have is
48:26 what are the crucial steps in learning
48:28 and doing data engineering to the master
48:31 it
48:33 can you repeat yeah what are the crucial
48:38 steps in learning and doing data
48:40 engineering so that I can really Master
48:42 it
48:47 um
48:58 I'm just thinking uh the the first thing
49:02 it's a very broad question yes yeah
49:07 yeah I tried
49:10 I will say that uh it's Duty some
49:16 uh I don't know how to explain that
49:21 because they're a big point I think it's
49:26 having a very technical
49:29 uh background
49:33 um
49:34 yeah for those who hasn't uh who haven't
49:39 the technical particular ground I don't
49:42 know
49:43 yeah so what it says you need to be a
49:46 software engineer
49:47 first to be a data engineer
49:50 it will be easier
49:55 I don't know how to answer that
49:58 yeah it's a very broad question because
50:00 like there are so many
50:02 steps in doing that well the first thing
50:06 is to have a very a good technical
50:09 background right so like perhaps if you
50:12 do not have experience uh
50:15 working as a software engineer maybe
50:18 this is what you can start with right so
50:20 just work as a usual back-end developer
50:22 or I don't know yes they're working
50:27 kind of uh with
50:31 a small data project
50:35 like back-end engineer or back-end
50:37 developer
50:43 so you start working as a software
50:46 engineer and then you start working on
50:48 small data projects
50:51 okay so that's enough to master it
50:54 yeah no keep going keep going okay
50:58 that's the the most important part right
51:02 yeah I guess this is not what the person
51:05 who was asking uh was really looking
51:09 um to get but I think like if we really
51:13 think about that that's like the main
51:15 idea right so work on projects and
51:18 repeat till you master it right uh kind
51:22 of sounds
51:23 simple but yeah what I can say is like
51:27 we have an entire course about data
51:28 engineering called Data engineering camp
51:30 and you can go there and check
51:33 um like what are the modules there
51:37 I think we have six I will not
51:40 talk about this exact modules you can go
51:42 and check but the main idea what you
51:44 Jose said is like just keep going keep
51:48 doing right and then work on a project
51:50 work on the next project we'll work on
51:51 the next project and then that's the
51:54 best way to master it right yeah
51:57 yeah I think there is no top I think
52:01 there is no master so you you can stop
52:05 uh the progress It's it's the same as
52:10 life
52:12 yeah right
52:15 um
52:17 said another question I see the question
52:19 there's a question from Elena
52:22 do you need to be registered in Norway
52:24 for your taxes
52:28 yes
52:30 so because it's like the companies in
52:32 Norwegian you have to be in Norway to be
52:35 able to work for them right yes
52:40 if you
52:42 are kind of uh swollen well you have
52:47 your small company outside Norway
52:52 kind of it's the same if you work with
52:55 United States or
52:58 other country
53:01 to work here to work here you need to be
53:05 registered
53:08 do you have a small company or how do
53:10 you
53:11 um write your retirement set up yes
53:15 right now in I mean I employ
53:20 so you're a full-time employee without
53:23 so just usual full-time contact right
53:27 okay
53:30 so
53:31 yeah another question from Elena is what
53:33 are the benefits of remote work I think
53:34 we've partly touched that
53:37 so you get the commute time so you don't
53:40 need to go to the office and back
53:44 um for you what are the other benefits
53:46 of
53:47 uh
53:50 not depend not depending uh depend on on
53:57 specific place
54:00 as you you can work everywhere you want
54:04 and yeah that's the biggest
54:10 benefits I think
54:14 and for you it means you can work
54:17 everywhere in Norway where you want or
54:19 you can work everywhere in the world
54:20 where you want
54:23 um
54:24 right now
54:25 in the world
54:27 yeah but uh the yeah it depends on your
54:32 company
54:33 if it allows it or not
54:38 so yeah I work uh I've been in Spain
54:43 last month and
54:45 [Music]
54:46 two months ago three months ago I was in
54:50 Argentina so
54:51 there's no problem
54:54 at least for my company
54:56 right yeah that's very convenient and
54:59 then you also said that you need to move
55:01 like every three months right yeah
55:03 so that's why you you need to have you
55:06 have to have this flexibility uh because
55:09 yeah you're never on the same place for
55:11 longer hmm
55:14 I'm really curious what kind of work
55:15 requires moving every three months
55:18 uh yeah
55:21 a nurse yeah
55:23 and then yeah she's uh yeah she had she
55:28 has contract
55:31 small contracts
55:33 yeah that's that's our point of view
55:35 because like that we kind of explore the
55:42 country
55:43 meaning while we are working so
55:47 that's the the the first or the biggest
55:50 thing we thought
55:55 that's a good opportunity
55:57 yeah that's really cool that
56:00 um we people in IIT in software
56:03 Engineers data Engineers later people
56:06 actually have this possibility of
56:08 finding a reward work right because like
56:10 foreigners it's not really impossible to
56:12 do things anymore yeah very difficult
56:16 yeah very difficult
56:19 um are there other advantages
56:23 yeah uh I think to them they weren't
56:26 related to and have more time
56:30 it's yeah you have more time to to be
56:34 with your family to do whatever you want
56:39 and that's all good
56:42 that's a good benefit as well
56:46 yeah and I think we already talked about
56:48 disadvantages right like loneliest
56:51 loneliness
56:53 what else like being difficult to
56:56 separate work from not work do you talk
56:59 about other things
57:00 or is there anything else you would like
57:03 to drawbacks
57:07 right now
57:10 no you know
57:12 okay well one question we always ask is
57:16 if you have any
57:19 resource recommendations like book
57:21 course whatever you probably can
57:24 recommend your newsletter I know but
57:25 apart from that is there anything else
57:27 you can recommend on the topic of either
57:30 remote working or data engineering or
57:33 maybe something else you recently
