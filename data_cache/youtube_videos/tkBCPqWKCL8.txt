1:47 out in the data talks slack and
1:50 i've been getting a lot of questions on
1:51 the book and uh it's been really great
1:53 just sharing thoughts on these things i
1:56 don't think we
1:56 discuss this stuff enough as developers
1:58 you know because it's soft
2:00 but um it is as important as coding
2:03 yeah i do agree that's why i thought
2:05 it's a
2:06 really great idea to reach out to you
2:08 and i was very happy when you said
2:10 yes you want to have to to to join our
2:12 podcast that's
2:13 that's great so before we go into our
2:16 main topic of marketing ourselves
2:18 let's start with your um background can
2:21 you tell us about
2:22 your career journey so far sure
2:25 i used to i so i'm originally from
2:27 singapore um
2:28 and i moved to the states for college
2:31 and
2:31 my first career was in finance so i did
2:33 everything from
2:34 central banking to investment banking to
2:36 hedge funds
2:38 if anyone is familiar with the finance
2:40 industry that is a grand tour of
2:41 everything there is to do in the finance
2:43 industry and eventually
2:46 part of part of the way that you level
2:49 up
2:50 in finance is that you learn to code in
2:52 order to
2:53 run quantitative models and risk
2:54 management and pricing and all that
2:57 so that's what i did and i realized that
2:58 that was something i wanted to do and
3:00 was better at
3:01 than the finance part um so i eventually
3:04 did a career switch at age 30
3:06 and started over as a junior from
3:08 scratch you know went to boot camp
3:10 did free code cap and everything and
3:13 you know worked my way through the ranks
3:15 i did i joined two sigma
3:17 as a front-end engineer then i got
3:20 noticed by netlify
3:21 that's when i started really doing the
3:22 learning public stuff because
3:25 um new york city was just a really good
3:27 place to
3:28 to do speaking as well as i started
3:30 blogging about reacts as well
3:32 and yeah so i worked at lfi did that for
3:35 two years and then
3:36 joined aws and i recently left aws
3:39 to be head of developer experience at
3:42 temporal.io
3:43 which i can also talk about for anyone
3:45 interested in the data processing
3:46 field because we also have interesting
3:48 stuff going on there but that's the
3:50 recap of the of the journey
3:52 last year in between jobs i essentially
3:54 wrote down
3:55 like a book of career advice because as
3:57 much as my writing
3:59 on like react and svelte and javascript
4:01 has been popular uh
4:02 the most popular stuff has has been the
4:04 non-technical stuff
4:06 so i decided to just like write down
4:08 everything that i have absorbed and
4:09 practice
4:11 i have resources that i collect a lot
4:13 because i
4:14 am a part of this movement called
4:16 building a second brain so i have my
4:17 second brain
4:18 and essentially the coding career
4:20 handbook which is the book that i wrote
4:22 is my second brain of 1500
4:25 links and resources and tweets and
4:28 advice that i've collected from other
4:29 people
4:30 so that's not something yeah i'm not
4:33 saying that i'm the authority but like
4:34 you know i i kind of you borrowed
4:36 authority from other people
4:38 um but it was a really good exercise to
4:40 to write and i think it's resonated with
4:42 a lot of people because
4:43 there's some gap in the market between
4:46 people
4:47 learning how to code and cracking the
4:48 interview and then they get they get
4:50 past the interview they get the job and
4:51 then they're like now what
4:53 and there's a huge gap between that and
4:55 being a senior and everyone
4:56 only wants to hire seniors so my goal is
4:59 to try to help people level up
5:01 from junior to senior and i you know i
5:04 also work at developer relations so
5:06 this this topic of marketing is is a big
5:08 one for people because
5:10 uh according to to this survey that i
5:12 saw you know uh
5:14 most developers understand that there is
5:16 some value to marketing
5:18 they just don't see themselves doing it
5:20 they see other people doing it
5:21 and they see it they're like oh this
5:23 person's already internet famous
5:24 that's not for me um and so part of what
5:27 i'm trying to do here
5:28 is to dispel that notion that there is
5:30 some level that you don't have to be
5:32 internet famous but there's some level
5:33 of self marketing
5:34 that you should do because otherwise
5:36 people are not going to know what you
5:38 did
5:38 or how good you are yeah interesting and
5:42 what i noticed from what you said so you
5:45 started in finance
5:46 and you worked as a quant rate some
5:48 quantitative analytics
5:50 and then you also now join temporal io
5:52 which is a data processing company so
5:54 you're a lot closer
5:56 to data than i thought well i mean
5:59 so i work on the front end of that
6:01 company right so
6:02 uh i don't know all the details but yes
6:07 it can be used for data we are not we're
6:10 not focused
6:11 on uh just data but we can talk about
6:13 that
6:14 when when the time comes yeah so about
6:17 marketing ourselves
6:19 so you are indeed one of the
6:22 people i follow on twitter for for this
6:25 for this stuff
6:26 like marketing ourselves learning in
6:29 public
6:30 and i wanted to ask you so why should we
6:34 market ourselves why is it important for
6:36 our careers i think you've touched
6:38 a bit now but maybe we can expand it a
6:41 little bit
6:43 yeah um i think there's
6:48 there's a lot of whys and it's very
6:49 personal you know what why do you do
6:51 what you do it's very different from why
6:52 i do what i do
6:54 um so there's part of it which is
6:56 getting recognition for your skills and
6:58 your work right the things that you
7:00 deserve
7:02 and if you ever wondered why you didn't
7:04 get that promotion or
7:05 why someone else who seems to know less
7:07 than you seems to do better as a career
7:09 um it's perhaps because they're
7:11 marketing yourselves better than you are
7:13 and that's an easy thing to fix because
7:16 the hard thing is actually doing stuff
7:18 so so i want people who you know have
7:21 the quality
7:22 and have the genuine skill to be able to
7:25 represent themselves better
7:27 so that they can get in front of the
7:29 right opportunities and the right
7:31 employers and
7:32 do better for themselves um i think it
7:34 also is there's some
7:35 there's some public service as well in
7:38 terms of
7:39 um you know if you don't market yourself
7:43 well then other people
7:44 who are less shy about it
7:49 will put themselves out there and and
7:51 get those opportunities and
7:53 maybe they would they're they won't do
7:54 as good of a job as you might
7:56 so i think that that's that's ultimately
8:00 uh the breakdown but i think people
8:02 understand that
8:03 at a bare minimum um
8:06 when you market yourself well you get
8:09 more
8:10 money essentially like some kind of like
8:12 lifetime opportunities that
8:14 translate into earnings and i think i
8:17 think that's just that's just a
8:18 fundamental motivator for anyone yeah so
8:21 like
8:22 any company who cares about some
8:24 internal
8:25 kpis at the end what they care about is
8:28 profit right
8:29 money so this is the same right
8:32 so yes but also i think you know
8:36 this is i don't want to make it too
8:38 commercial
8:40 you know what is when you when you
8:42 create an open source project
8:44 and you want people to use your stuff
8:45 for free you still have to market your
8:47 open source project and that is
8:49 a similar skill and yeah
8:52 whenever whenever you're trying to push
8:55 an idea that you want to promote within
8:57 the company let's say
8:58 hey i want to switch to this other tech
9:00 stack or
9:02 i have this feature idea which i think
9:03 is really great you have to market that
9:04 idea
9:05 these are all parts of marketing
9:07 yourself and
9:09 they'll be affected by your credibility
9:11 but also your ability to market that
9:13 idea so
9:14 there's just all related skills that you
9:16 should practice
9:17 and compound through the rest of your
9:19 life yeah so basically
9:22 we want to do this because we want to
9:24 get more recognition
9:25 why we want to get more recognition
9:27 because maybe we want to be promoted
9:29 right so
9:30 we have the technical skills but
9:34 i know that many people myself included
9:37 uh
9:38 in tech domain it's difficult like it's
9:40 a lot easier to
9:42 just code rather than go and stay in
9:45 front of people
9:46 say something or even just tweet
9:49 tweeting is also difficult right
9:51 because you can start thinking um what
9:53 people will think about me right
9:56 but compared to what we are doing as
9:58 developers
9:59 this is a lot easier right it's only 200
10:02 characters 280 characters right
10:05 so it's a lot easier than writing a big
10:08 system right so we should use this
10:11 opportunity and
10:12 then maybe get that promotion or get a
10:14 better job or get
10:17 recognition and if you're an open source
10:19 author
10:20 people will find your library right
10:23 yes sir yeah exactly yeah so
10:26 um yeah we i think um
10:30 so in this case like if you're doing
10:32 this uh
10:34 let's say for more job opportunities um
10:37 so this is external
10:38 right so this is you're working to be
10:40 noticed outside of the company
10:42 right and then there is a different kind
10:44 of marketing which is noticed inside the
10:46 company
10:48 so maybe
10:52 let's say i want to become better i want
10:55 to get some recognition outside of my
10:57 company
10:58 i know how to code right so i'm
11:01 relatively good at this
11:03 maybe better than some of my colleagues
11:04 maybe worse than some other like
11:06 an average developer so
11:09 what do i need to do to be better at
11:12 personal marketing so what kind of
11:14 things i need to do
11:17 that's a very broad question so for
11:19 those who don't know there actually is a
11:22 basically when i wrote my book i
11:23 published this chapter for free
11:26 and it was part of marketing for the
11:28 book which is very meta
11:30 writing about marketing while marketing
11:32 uh but there is a graphic that i that i
11:34 send people
11:35 you know where i i basically try to
11:37 break down
11:38 the where i see marketing in terms of
11:40 personal branding in terms of the domain
11:42 that you pick
11:43 the business value that you can deliver
11:45 the tech skills that you have
11:47 and then picking you know the the the
11:49 channel which you're delivering to
11:50 so uh whether you're talking about
11:52 public marketing or
11:54 uh internal within work um so you're
11:56 talking about public marketing
11:58 uh it's it's still gonna derive from
11:59 those those primary factors right
12:01 the the channel doesn't matter you still
12:04 need to
12:04 understand what your personal brand is
12:07 and to be able to
12:08 communicate that and tell that story
12:10 effectively
12:12 um you need to understand what domain
12:14 that you're
12:15 picking and you're planting your flag on
12:17 you need to understand what business
12:18 value you've delivered in the past
12:20 and be able to tell that story like you
12:22 know have numbers and have
12:24 concise descriptions of the projects
12:25 that you've that you've had um
12:27 and then you need to work on your skills
12:29 to
12:30 to uh do cool stuff and cover your bases
12:32 so there's just so many details here um
12:34 like we can go into any one of them
12:36 yeah well let's say i already have some
12:39 skills
12:40 maybe i'm not to the the top developer
12:44 but i know how to code let's say i know
12:46 python or javascript doesn't matter like
12:48 maybe i'm good at
12:49 data science uh so let's say
12:52 that usually an average developer has
12:55 but
12:56 um yeah so you said the first thing was
12:58 personal brand so how do i find my
13:00 personal brand as a
13:02 as an average data scientist or as an
13:04 average software engineer
13:06 well first of all you should not be
13:08 yourself as average i think that's
13:10 starting on the wrong foot so look for
13:13 look for anything about you that is not
13:14 average um and that could be
13:17 anything about your identity your your
13:19 opinions you know if you're very
13:21 opinionated about one particular thing
13:23 then be that person that that is the
13:25 champion for that movement
13:26 in the industry that's that makes you
13:29 stand out and that's a that's a personal
13:30 brand
13:31 for example actually a really cute way
13:34 to think about whether you have a
13:35 personal brand or not
13:37 is can people make a meme of you can can
13:39 people like employ your friends
13:41 make fun of you if you if they can and
13:43 everyone gets it
13:45 then you really have a personal brand uh
13:47 you know it's it's uh
13:48 because you say something so much or
13:49 you're just so well known that
13:51 uh people feel comfortable making fun of
13:53 you because uh
13:54 you know that you're not gonna be
13:56 offended because it's really something
13:58 that you believe
14:00 um yeah and uh and then there's there's
14:02 other there's other things you know like
14:04 um having
14:05 consistent photo and consistent naming
14:08 so
14:08 uh the reason so consistency is
14:10 important because
14:12 you form brand impressions and this is
14:14 something that is practiced at the
14:15 highest levels of marketing like
14:16 cola nike and all these kind of
14:18 companies but consistency right we spend
14:21 so
14:21 many millions of dollars making sure
14:23 that like the the curve
14:25 of stripes logo is always 35 degrees
14:28 um we you know we make sure that the
14:31 color of coca-cola is red is always the
14:33 same red um
14:35 the same way in the same way we can make
14:37 sure in our own personal branding that
14:39 the things that appear to other people
14:41 are the same things that appear every
14:42 single time
14:43 and because repeated impressions some
14:45 some say between 17 and 14
14:47 times that's how much it takes to
14:49 imprint and print upon somebody
14:51 uh that you know you stand for something
14:54 um so the reason why i actually think
14:57 that people should
14:58 go take a professional photo if they if
14:59 they can is because the photo is
15:02 seen more than your actual face
15:06 especially because all the communication
15:07 is in slack these days or on twitter or
15:10 speaker notes and all that um your photo
15:13 matters a lot and
15:14 having a nice photo having you smile to
15:17 somebody that you haven't met before
15:19 and having them just have a good general
15:21 impression of you i think that counts
15:22 for something
15:23 um that is your digital storefront in a
15:25 sense and they see that more than your
15:27 name
15:28 so your name is the second uh most seen
15:31 thing and sometimes you can just go by
15:33 your regular name
15:35 uh sometimes that can be hard for people
15:36 to remember
15:38 and so for me i happen to have my
15:40 nickname right swix which is my english
15:42 and chinese initials i haven't have had
15:44 that since i was 13 so
15:45 it's a unique name i have the domain
15:47 it's uh i have the handle on most social
15:49 media sites
15:50 it's a good it's a good name some other
15:52 people might actually
15:54 choose to brand themselves a different
15:55 way so i have a friend who was
15:57 javascript joe for a long time
15:59 so he was the javascript guy for his
16:01 company
16:02 uh and within his network and and you
16:04 can in the same way you can brand
16:05 yourself
16:06 some other way right uh so like the
16:09 uh there's another guy i know who's the
16:12 entrepreneurial coder so he
16:14 studies a mix of business and uh
16:16 development um
16:17 you can you can just brand yourself in a
16:19 different way but like as long as
16:21 people refer to you in the same way then
16:22 that starts to compound and accumulate
16:25 your branding and that's that's a very
16:27 strong brand as well
16:28 um consistent keywords is also an
16:31 interesting one so
16:32 i have another friend david korsheed who
16:34 shows up
16:35 any time the word state machine is
16:37 mentioned and so much
16:38 so much so that we make memes of him and
16:40 make fun of him but that's great that
16:42 that is a really consistent brand
16:43 because
16:44 anytime someone has that problem he
16:46 comes to mind immediately
16:48 and that's the what that's what you want
16:50 to achieve you want to achieve such a
16:52 strong association
16:54 with some important problem that you can
16:55 solve that you are the first to mine for
16:58 someone
16:58 and first to mind is best uh
17:02 we don't really we don't really you know
17:04 go out and survey the entire universe
17:06 with 40 million developers and say like
17:07 who's the best at this thing
17:09 we just think about you know the top
17:10 three or five people that everyone
17:12 thinks about
17:13 and your goal as a personal branding
17:15 person or a self-marketer
17:17 is to get into that consideration set of
17:19 three or five options
17:21 and just do that enough so that your
17:24 name just comes up and you get
17:25 exposed to so many opportunities it's
17:27 amazing okay
17:29 so the first thing you said stop
17:31 thinking of yourself as average
17:32 right so there's something you must be
17:34 good at then the second thing go get a
17:36 professional picture
17:39 or a nice or a nice picture or like a i
17:42 think that you're not
17:43 the fridge right you don't have to use
17:45 your real face by the way some people
17:46 are not comfortable with that
17:48 but you can just use a logo right um and
17:50 uh so sebastian mark vulgar
17:52 nobody knows what he looks like but he
17:54 uses an eucalyptus plant
17:56 and he's used that for the past 10 years
17:58 that's fine he's the eucalyptus guy
18:00 that's that's that's his face uh as long
18:02 as it's consistent
18:04 okay so then being consistent and then
18:06 he said uh
18:07 you need to appear at least i don't know
18:09 i don't remember the number 60 or 80
18:11 times
18:11 before 7 to 14 this i picked this up
18:14 from the digital marketing guy who knows
18:15 okay
18:16 so it means that once so it means that
18:20 we need
18:21 all of the above that we just said plus
18:24 right at least i don't know uh
18:27 impressions
18:28 yeah then you know the same way that
18:30 people do marketing on you like they
18:31 retarget you and like
18:33 try to make their brand show up in front
18:35 of you multiple times
18:37 that's how you're going to be to other
18:38 people we work the same way
18:40 why are we different than brands we are
18:43 brands
18:43 yeah so how do we do this so okay
18:46 picture is clear so we just
18:47 get go pay somebody to take a picture a
18:50 professional picture of us
18:51 with the name it's also somewhat clear
18:54 so it's either given
18:55 by our parents or maybe a nickname but
18:59 what to write about what to tweet about
19:02 how the
19:02 yeah domain exactly um
19:05 i i actually want to double down on the
19:07 picture thing
19:08 it's actually like you have no idea how
19:11 how
19:12 often i get this comment where i'll be
19:15 the same picture on discord youtube
19:16 github
19:18 uh and twitter right and people will say
19:20 like hey you're the guy from where
19:21 from youtube or you're the guy from
19:23 discord or you got from twitter
19:25 and they really form a strong emotional
19:26 connection to you even though you barely
19:28 know them
19:29 that's great because they just see you
19:31 so often it's
19:32 it's really nice so um that's that's how
19:35 it works for you and i really want to
19:37 emphasize that consistency
19:38 and repetition okay let's talk about
19:41 domain um
19:42 so yeah picking a domain that's
19:43 something that comes from you like what
19:45 do you particularly
19:46 work on and are interested in i think
19:49 people might have a bit of decision
19:52 fatigue
19:53 because you could be interested in a
19:54 hundred different things
19:56 so the advice i normally give here is
20:00 that
20:01 realize that when you pick something
20:02 you're not closing doors you're not
20:04 saying i will not do
20:05 anything else for the rest of my life
20:07 you're just saying this is what i'm
20:08 currently interested in and you're
20:09 allowed to change
20:11 uh but having some top topic
20:14 uh is much better than just saying i'm
20:17 equally interested in a bunch of
20:18 like 10 different things that's that's
20:21 not branding that's not that's not a
20:22 good way to market yourself because i
20:24 don't know
20:24 what your trigger point is so i can't
20:27 say like you're my
20:28 whatever person like you're my uh
20:33 you're my data warehouse guy okay you
20:34 know like if that's your thing
20:36 and you know everything about it you're
20:38 like in all the all the conversations
20:40 um you can't stop talking about it like
20:43 i'll just like mention the topic you can
20:44 go for on a podcast for one hour
20:46 um that is your domain and that's that's
20:48 great and then i can use
20:49 you as my expert i can send people your
20:52 way if they're also interested in
20:54 learning more
20:55 that's how marketing works you have to
20:56 pick a domain and
20:58 and i think people refusing to pick a
20:59 domain is out of their fear
21:02 of closing doors and they should realize
21:04 that people change domains all the time
21:06 and it's totally fine but just just pick
21:08 one up how niche should it be like how
21:10 broad or the niche
21:14 should should not be too niche there is
21:17 such a thing as
21:18 too niche but obviously the the narrower
21:20 the better
21:21 because you should prove some kind of
21:22 expertise and it's hard to prove
21:24 expertise in a very broad domain right
21:26 like
21:26 let's just say like you want to pick
21:29 expertise in python okay you're going up
21:31 against
21:32 you know david b is the end and
21:35 uh get over and roll some or whoever
21:37 else like um
21:39 but if you if you pick a very specific
21:40 domain uh
21:42 and and and you only specialize in that
21:45 you not only have a better chance of
21:47 reaching it but you also people can slot
21:49 you in
21:50 into their universe without competition
21:52 because that's that's an existing white
21:53 space
21:54 so i like i like niches um
21:58 be careful about being too niche the way
22:00 that you prevent from being too niche
22:02 is that uh just be mindful of how many
22:05 people share the same problems as
22:07 as you solve so as long as
22:10 you know you can fill a room of like i
22:12 don't know 50 people with with that
22:13 problem then you have a
22:14 meet up that you could that you can run
22:16 and that's that's a good niche
22:18 so how do you find this out do you try
22:20 to run a meet up and see how many people
22:21 show up or
22:22 there is a i have actually done that yes
22:32 yeah it is a javascript framework it is
22:34 one of the newer ones compared to react
22:35 and view
22:36 um but it is so and it is niche because
22:40 it's a very it's the smallest one out of
22:41 the big four um but it was just
22:45 enough interest that i could start a
22:47 meet up and now we have a
22:48 global community of about 10 000 people
22:51 um
22:52 but what was i gonna say um
22:55 yeah you don't have to start a meetup
22:57 you can just pay attention to what
22:59 people are talking about
23:00 subscribe to your industry newsletters
23:02 um look out for industry conferences and
23:05 look at the schedule of the talks you
23:06 don't even have to show up to the
23:07 conference
23:08 you can just look at the schedule to
23:09 talk and understand what people are
23:10 working on
23:11 um you can look on hacker news and see
23:14 what people are very interested in
23:15 discussing right like if
23:17 if there's like a new announcement and
23:19 then there's not much engagement
23:20 then whatever but like if there's like
23:22 500 comments of people going back and
23:23 forth
23:24 that that is a topic that gets people
23:26 really excited
23:27 and if you can specialize in that
23:30 then you become an authority that people
23:32 care about so it's it's always this
23:34 intersection i call this like a nexus
23:36 of interest the things that you're
23:38 you're very interested in and
23:39 things that other people are very
23:41 interested in you need to find that
23:42 intersection you can't just work on
23:44 things that only you get because
23:46 nobody's going to care
23:47 and don't be surprised that nobody cares
23:50 so
23:51 uh yeah okay so to find a niche
23:55 uh you don't have to start a meetup so
23:57 you can subscribe to
23:58 industry newsletters have a look at
24:01 twitter hangout and hacker news and
24:02 trade
24:05 exactly check conferences
24:08 so then you find a topic that
24:12 people seem to be excited about and you
24:15 i don't know want to start writing
24:17 tweeting about this so
24:18 what how do you market yourself like for
24:21 marketing we need to have some sort of
24:22 marketing channel
24:23 so how do we uh we selected a topic so
24:26 how do we communicate
24:27 that we know this topic how do you
24:30 communicate that you know this topic
24:32 well when you start out you actually
24:34 don't right so you shouldn't try to be
24:36 an overnight expert
24:37 i think a lot of people when they view
24:40 learn in public
24:40 and they view this marketing yourself
24:42 movement they see a lot of hucksters
24:44 they see a lot of scammers or grifters
24:45 or whatever you call it
24:47 uh people who are not genuinely carrying
24:49 on this face and they're just there to
24:51 try to market themselves and grow their
24:52 following or whatever
24:54 so i definitely do not encourage anybody
24:56 to do that be
24:57 genuine be be authentic and say like i
25:00 don't know
25:01 anything about this space but i'm
25:02 learning and here's what i have so far
25:04 that's all you do and you progress every
25:07 single day
25:08 a little bit better than you were the
25:09 day before people can follow along on
25:12 your journey
25:13 people can correct you if you're wrong
25:15 and eventually you will have been
25:16 corrected of all the basic mistakes
25:18 and you will see you look back and you
25:20 go like okay okay
25:21 i'm now an expert because i've made all
25:23 the mistakes or i've seen
25:24 all the i've asked all the questions
25:27 i've answered i've answered a lot of
25:28 other people's questions
25:29 and now i'm an expert but i've earned it
25:32 and you have to earn it
25:33 um you can't just say like because i'm a
25:36 very good marketer i don't i can skip
25:37 all the other steps
25:38 um no you have to write so basically i
25:42 guess for what you said
25:43 to try to learn in public and inform
25:46 others about your progress
25:48 and that could be like probably the best
25:50 media for these
25:51 social media like twitter linkedin
25:54 so i always think about this social
25:56 media is a borrowed
25:58 platform you're working on other
25:59 people's platform to get more
26:01 distribution
26:02 but at the end of the day you do not own
26:03 any of any part of it twitter can lock
26:05 you out at any time i think lots of
26:06 twice
26:07 by twitter people can cancel you uh
26:10 you can suddenly lose relevance um
26:14 whatever like the algorithm changes and
26:17 your your
26:18 pages vanish from google these are all
26:20 borrowed platforms
26:21 so the channel that you ultimately own
26:23 is your own personal domain your own
26:25 personal mailing list
26:26 your own personal podcast these are the
26:27 things that i'm focusing on right now
26:30 um so you can start off with social
26:32 media but eventually try to link people
26:34 back
26:34 and grow your own platform and someday
26:37 when your platform is big enough then
26:38 you can just
26:39 go all in on that and the social media
26:40 becomes the extension of
26:43 just like a new post
26:46 game talk um i think i think that's
26:49 that's a fundamentally uh
26:52 long-running way because all these
26:53 platforms there will be a day that
26:54 twitter dies it will be a day youtube
26:56 dies
26:57 um but probably the somebody bans you
26:59 from twitter which is more likely to
27:01 happen than
27:02 all the other days but like probably the
27:05 web the open web
27:06 is going to last longer than any of us
27:11 yeah so you said build a mail in this so
27:14 how do i go from a person who just
27:16 picked
27:17 a topic and want to start learning
27:20 this in public and then tweeting about
27:22 this every day to actually having
27:24 my own website with a mailing this there
27:26 or should i have this
27:28 right from the start or how does it work
27:31 how does the process
27:32 help us i think i don't think it hurts
27:34 it's not that hard you know
27:36 especially for developers kind of
27:37 aesthetic side uh
27:39 throw up a blog just don't expect anyone
27:42 to
27:42 go to your site because they don't know
27:44 you um
27:46 but as they start to to know your work
27:48 then they'll start to visit your site
27:50 um you know i i took a long time to
27:53 get up to something like uh 50 000
27:56 followers a month
27:57 um and um yeah
28:00 the other thing the other thing i think
28:02 i mean so so yes like
28:04 uh you can you can start as early as
28:06 possible uh or you can just
28:08 go only social and and try to build from
28:11 build your distribution from there and
28:12 then take it off
28:13 those networks um yeah i mean
28:16 that to me that's not the issue the
28:18 issue is what are you writing about or
28:20 speaking about
28:21 and does it matter to other people so i
28:23 have an idea here
28:24 called pick up what they put down
28:26 because i think a lot of people when
28:27 they start
28:28 this public learning or content creation
28:31 journey
28:32 they'll write what they want to
28:35 to read and and then they'll be
28:38 very surprised that the reception isn't
28:41 that great
28:42 i think there's a few factors one is
28:44 they just they're new to it
28:46 so they don't have a lot of practice um
28:47 so don't expect that greatest result
28:49 but second of all they're not picking on
28:51 something that they know somebody
28:53 will want to read so they haven't
28:56 invested that much in the interests of
28:57 other people they don't really know
28:59 or have a have a sense of what people uh
29:03 really want to hear so i think having a
29:06 conversation with somebody is really
29:07 interesting
29:08 so this this idea of picking what they
29:10 put down is essentially like
29:11 you have mentors you have uh leaders in
29:13 the community
29:14 who are putting out ideas all the time
29:16 by definition they're too
29:17 busy to follow through on it on most of
29:21 them
29:22 so they're always looking for partners
29:24 and experts and mentees
29:26 um to to follow up on the stuff that
29:28 they do so
29:29 so if they put out a new blog post read
29:31 it and like respond to it if they put a
29:32 new demo
29:33 actually try out the code and report
29:35 bugs if they put out a new book
29:37 go through and summarize it and promote
29:39 it for them um
29:41 and these are all just interesting ways
29:42 and individually
29:44 you know they may not work at all you
29:46 just might get ignored
29:47 but your chances of being noticed and
29:49 responded to
29:50 are way higher than the average like
29:54 i had a i had someone who was like i'm
29:56 gonna start learning public and the
29:57 first thing that they wrote was like a
29:59 guide to man pages in linux and like i
30:02 don't i don't get up in the morning and
30:03 go like i really need a guide for my
30:05 pages
30:07 so it's not something somebody maybe
30:09 does somebody does there maybe
30:11 right maybe but like i'm not going to
30:13 find them and
30:14 you know the chances are lower but if
30:17 you wrote a response
30:18 directly to a blog post that i just put
30:20 out this morning i
30:22 i am going to read it okay um if there's
30:25 a
30:25 what did you post today i just posted a
30:28 blog post about stripe
30:29 so i so paul graham paul graham tweeted
30:32 this
30:33 a few months ago and i've been thinking
30:34 about it uh what if stripe
30:36 is the next google right stripe is
30:38 currently worth 100 billion dollars
30:40 google is worth 1500 billion dollars so
30:44 what do you do how do you position
30:45 yourself if strike becomes the next
30:47 google
30:48 and you knew that for a fact uh there's
30:50 so much
30:51 economic and career opportunity there
30:54 and nobody's thinking about it because
30:55 we always think about
30:56 where things are today and google
30:59 you know people try to optimize for fang
31:02 but stripe is an up-and-coming fang
31:04 actually it's better to tie yourself to
31:05 a becomer rather than something that's
31:07 already at the top
31:08 um so like stuff like that um so paul
31:12 paul's probably going to read my post
31:13 because i directly uh addressed him
31:16 but someone else you know if someone
31:18 else responds to my post i'll probably
31:19 read that
31:20 and it's the same thing at a company
31:21 level right like so part of the reason i
31:23 got
31:24 uh noticed by netlify is because i
31:26 started using them and i started
31:28 tweeting about them
31:29 and guess what every single startup
31:30 every single company has a slack channel
31:32 that is dedicated to people tweeting
31:34 about their service because they want to
31:35 know
31:36 they want to read they want to respond
31:38 so
31:39 if you want to guarantee yourself being
31:42 read by someone
31:43 criticize them praise them anything to
31:46 do with them
31:47 because it becomes focused on their
31:49 interests
31:50 rather than yours and i'm not saying to
31:53 do this all the time you should
31:54 obviously explore your own
31:55 interests as well i'm just saying if you
31:57 want to guarantee feedback
31:58 because people thrive on feedback if you
32:01 want to guarantee feedback
32:02 then think about what people are
32:04 interested in
32:05 and people are usually interested in
32:07 themselves so
32:09 if let's say i'm just starting on
32:10 twitter and then i
32:12 put out uh 100 tweets and they just go
32:16 to the void because nobody reads them
32:18 that can happen right because you don't
32:19 think you have any followers there
32:21 so you just tweet and just anyone
32:24 anyone who's interested look at my own
32:26 uh tweets from like 2016 2017.
32:29 nobody i don't know why i competing
32:32 i should have given up so the strategy
32:35 to actually
32:37 get noticed is to you said pick it
32:40 up where they they put it down do they
32:42 say yeah it's an american saying
32:43 uh so i don't know how well it
32:45 translates but it's an american saying
32:47 like uh if other people are putting down
32:49 something like putting
32:51 on leaving something on the table for
32:53 people to
32:54 continue on and carry on with most
32:56 people just leave it leave it there and
32:58 they just go about that there they
32:59 ignore it or they say like very nice
33:01 i have my own things to do but you
33:03 because you're interested in personal
33:05 growth
33:05 you can pick it up and carry on with it
33:07 and then you become a partner with them
33:10 okay yeah i'm wondering if a strategy
33:14 for me
33:14 to let's say if i want to market myself
33:17 because i want to find a job
33:19 would the strategy be different if i'm a
33:21 student or if i'm
33:23 somebody who already has experience in a
33:25 different domain want to
33:26 transition to a new domain would my
33:28 strategy be different in these cases
33:31 sure yeah i mean you know the students
33:34 students unfortunately don't have a ton
33:36 to offer um
33:38 you know because a lot of times you're
33:39 coming in with zero work experience
33:42 um so you can you can show how eager you
33:44 are you can show how
33:45 uh how much you're willing to invest in
33:47 learning and being coached
33:49 for example if you do something and then
33:52 and then
33:52 people give you feedback do you actually
33:54 take that feedback and internalize it
33:56 and come back with not only the feedback
33:58 incorporated
33:59 but then the second order thinking about
34:02 like okay what else does
34:03 what else does this line of thinking uh
34:06 lead me to do
34:07 you show either your trajectory you show
34:09 the slope of your growth rather than the
34:10 absolute position of your growth
34:12 um whereas people who are transferring
34:14 from another field
34:16 uh maybe that's that's something that
34:17 you can give in terms of equivalence
34:19 exchange
34:20 so that's something that i i also say
34:22 about picking a domain right like
34:24 we still listed on this topic of picking
34:26 a domain which is like i have my domain
34:28 you have your domain
34:29 together we are actually better than if
34:32 we both try to specialize in everything
34:34 at once
34:35 right like i now that now that i
34:37 specialize in something and
34:38 my friend has specialized in other
34:39 things i can always ping him whenever i
34:41 need
34:42 help on that thing and that actually is
34:44 a mutual exchange of value
34:45 like so so whatever you have that is
34:48 valuable to the other people figure that
34:49 out
34:50 and offer it to them in exchange for
34:52 mentoring tutoring
34:54 opportunities in in their thing so i'll
34:56 give you one example when i transitioned
34:58 from finance to tech i actually took
35:00 two years to do it the first year i was
35:03 a non-technical product manager
35:04 for fint fintech company i turned from a
35:07 customer
35:08 of a of a sas startup into a product
35:11 manager
35:12 and so i traded in my finance knowledge
35:16 for the opportunity to work in tech to
35:18 figure out
35:19 how to work it what the terminology is
35:22 and figure out where i should be
35:24 focusing my attention to
35:25 and then it took another year for me to
35:27 another code
35:29 how did you convince your future
35:32 employer back then to
35:33 actually hire you to because i was a
35:36 customer expert i was a customer
35:38 i i turned from customer to employee
35:42 and they needed someone who was a
35:43 customer expert
35:47 i had one domain expertise and i was
35:49 completely new the other thing
35:50 so i traded in traded that in as a
35:53 mutual exchange
35:54 i think this is one of the most
35:56 difficult parts is to show
35:58 that okay i have this experience let's
36:01 say i'm transitioning from
36:03 i don't know quality assurance or maybe
36:05 from even let's say from academia so i
36:07 was doing a phd i was doing research
36:09 and now i want to go to development or
36:12 data science
36:13 so this thing they have some overlapped
36:15 but uh
36:16 no it's uh it's not that large right so
36:19 how do
36:20 and then there is a company and i want
36:22 to say hey hire me
36:24 so let's have this mutual exchange and
36:26 then
36:28 we're not sure so probably you should
36:30 focus on a specific company in this case
36:32 right
36:35 yeah that helps okay okay you know
36:40 there are some people who brag about uh
36:42 they've like applied to 400 companies
36:45 um and it's just like spraying and
36:48 praying there's no way you're
36:49 authentically interested in all 400 of
36:50 them
36:51 so i much prefer the focused approach um
36:54 when i
36:54 was you know applying for my first job i
36:56 applied to nine
36:58 and i got offers at three of them and
37:01 that's fine it's a good conversion at
37:03 the end of the day you only need one job
37:05 yeah and your conversion goes up because
37:07 you have more time to research these
37:08 companies and be more intentional about
37:10 like
37:11 why you want to join uh what uh you know
37:14 what their processes are you can
37:15 actually research
37:17 the interview process yeah there's just
37:19 so much more that they can do when you
37:20 focus
37:22 so now which since our topic is about
37:25 promoting
37:25 ourselves now i'm wondering there is
37:27 again probably some
37:29 difference between uh let's say i'm
37:31 changing the industry
37:33 and i want to get the first job versus
37:35 i'm already in that industry and i just
37:37 want to
37:38 change my job right so in this case our
37:40 strategy would probably be different
37:42 so how in first case let's say i'm
37:45 switching
37:46 industry so how do i promote myself in
37:49 such a way
37:50 that i am noticed by the companies
37:53 so one way you said we can just
37:58 apply to companies directly so be very
37:59 focused let's apply
38:01 like apply to nine companies and get
38:02 three offers
38:04 but the other way is to let everyone
38:07 know about us
38:08 and wait till companies start to
38:11 approach us right
38:12 it should also be possible so how do we
38:15 do this so how do we uh promote
38:18 ourselves
38:19 that this thing happens
38:23 is it even possible because i think your
38:24 face is a bit skeptical
38:27 no i just i don't i don't feel like i
38:28 get the question
38:30 so the question is i'm changing an
38:32 industry right so i want to promote
38:34 myself so i want to go on twitter
38:36 i want to go to some other social media
38:39 and
38:39 start tweeting about something let's say
38:41 i have some domain because i
38:43 i work in physics and i want to go into
38:46 data analytics so here's my domain data
38:48 analytics
38:49 or javascript doesn't matter so we
38:52 picked up this domain
38:54 and we want to get noticed we want to
38:56 get hired by somebody
38:58 so how do we do this how do we how our
39:01 strategy should look like
39:02 so first of all you said we learn in
39:04 public so
39:06 we're working on something and we just
39:08 tweet about this
39:09 is it enough or we need to do something
39:11 extra on top of that
39:14 um you can always improve your chances
39:18 you can um you know do do informational
39:20 interviews with uh
39:21 people like you know to say i'm
39:23 interested in joining the company do you
39:25 have 30 minutes to chat
39:26 a lot of people will say no but some
39:28 people will say yes and you can
39:30 talk to them about what it's like at the
39:31 company and learn just just learn more
39:33 about
39:33 how it's organized what the mission is
39:36 what the products
39:38 you know really really is under the hood
39:40 anything that can help
39:42 you in that in that understanding of the
39:43 company so that you can get the job
39:45 um there are other ways
39:48 you know where for example if you're a
39:50 designer this is very common
39:52 you can do an unsolicited redesign of
39:54 the company's products
39:55 right show off what you could do for the
39:58 company
39:59 and explain your thinking even though
40:01 even if they may not use the ideas they
40:03 might use someone with that kind of
40:05 motivation that you're putting in
40:06 the work even though you're not
40:08 technically working at the company
40:10 you're just putting in the workers you
40:11 enjoy it and you have strong
40:13 some strong opinion about how the
40:15 company should should
40:17 function and if they like it they'll
40:19 probably hire you
40:20 it shouldn't be done in public or oh
40:23 yeah so they just tweet hey
40:24 uh slack here's my redesign right
40:28 so this is how it works or yeah
40:30 absolutely this is very common for
40:31 designers um i think for
40:33 for developers you know you're you're
40:36 it's a little bit less visible
40:38 so something you can do is uh build a
40:40 clone right i've seen a lot of people
40:42 build
40:42 slack clones or clubhouse clones or
40:46 whatever and it just shows a level of
40:49 understanding
40:50 of like the engineering decisions behind
40:52 such a product
40:53 that you can often skip quite a few
40:55 interview rounds
40:57 because you've already done the work and
40:59 it just makes
41:00 it just demonstrated your interest in
41:02 the company that you're that you're
41:04 joining
41:05 i have one really good example but this
41:07 is from from the marketing point of view
41:09 go to nema for airbnb.com
41:13 and this is someone who works in i think
41:16 product management marketing
41:18 and she really wanted to work at airbnb
41:20 so she created
41:21 a mock airbnb site that demonstrates
41:24 what airbnb is missing by missing out on
41:26 uh the middle east which is where she
41:28 was from so and she was just like
41:30 went into detail about like how you know
41:34 airbnb could expand and why she was the
41:36 perfect person to be part of that
41:38 expansion um ultimate ultimately
41:41 she went to a different company but
41:44 airbnb
41:45 at least interviewed her because of this
41:48 uh
41:48 because he because it went viral and got
41:50 rich um but this this amount of
41:52 dedication like it's pretty common i
41:54 think there's there's some other guy who
41:55 also did like
41:56 you know hire me spotify and then like
41:58 the whole site in just
42:00 the spotify theme like to just really
42:02 get and demonstrate that he understands
42:04 the products in
42:05 the company's mission and i think anyone
42:08 you shouldn't do this for every company
42:10 because it's very
42:11 it's a very high effort but you know
42:13 when you're something when you're very
42:15 interested in a company
42:16 that's the kind of thing that really
42:17 gets you noticed
42:20 i should also mention uh you know some
42:22 people just really struggle
42:23 um being hired at the company
42:26 uh is better than being unemployed for
42:29 like more than a year
42:30 um so if you're not getting in in the
42:33 front door let's say
42:34 you're trying to go from like
42:37 you know non-technical to to engineer
42:40 if you're not getting into the front
42:42 door it can often be easier to transfer
42:43 laterally within the company
42:45 so join the company in a position that's
42:47 not really what you want
42:49 uh do well in that position and then
42:51 offer to do free work
42:53 or or make friends with the department
42:56 that you actually want to join
42:57 and then transfer internally after the
42:58 year this is very very common
43:00 because people just have weird hiring
43:02 bars like when they hire you
43:04 through the front door they want you to
43:05 pass all these
43:07 weird tests but when they hire their
43:10 colleagues uh it's just more about do
43:12 they like you or do they trust you
43:13 that's it and everything else can be
43:15 taught
43:17 yeah interesting it's uh
43:20 a nice thing to do but i imagine it
43:22 takes a lot of time to
43:24 to build this purified one um let's say
43:27 i
43:27 work already i'm already experienced and
43:30 i want to find a new job in the same
43:32 domain
43:32 so in this case what do i share what do
43:35 i
43:36 write about oh
43:39 stuff that i do at work well
43:42 you shouldn't disclose secrets um
43:45 especially if it
43:45 involves other people's work um be very
43:48 very careful about that
43:49 and um always if in doubt check with
43:52 them
43:53 um but yeah you can you can publish just
43:56 uh
43:56 you know new things that are going on in
43:58 your industry uh problems that you
44:00 solved and overcame
44:02 like war stories like some some
44:04 production outage it's always very
44:05 interesting to people
44:07 uh and then uh yeah i mean
44:10 i i i don't know because like this is to
44:13 me i i never have a problem with this
44:15 and now people always ask me this and
44:16 i'm just like
44:17 there's so many questions and ideas out
44:19 there that i cannot possibly cover all
44:21 of them
44:22 just look out just open your eyes to
44:24 what's up there
44:25 and uh i i can listen to a podcast and
44:29 come out with like two blog post ideas
44:32 so there's there's just so many things
44:34 that are unanswered
44:35 or especially if you think like i think
44:38 a lot of people maybe
44:39 they think like oh there's there's
44:40 someone else who's already written this
44:41 blog post on there like
44:42 there's nothing there's no value that i
44:44 can contribute um
44:45 there's still value in having your
44:47 personal take on something that's
44:49 already widely well known
44:50 especially if it's referenced multiple
44:52 times by you
44:54 you can essentially write your own proxy
44:55 of this idea so let's say
44:58 there's this idea of anti-fragile right
45:01 that everyone really loves by nassim
45:04 taleb
45:05 and he's written the authoritative book
45:06 on it but instead of
45:08 linking to that book on amazon you could
45:11 link to your summary of that book
45:13 on your perspective on your personal
45:15 perspective any stories that you might
45:17 have uh
45:18 had that relate to this or like you know
45:21 your
45:21 your idea on like what people don't when
45:24 people think they understand about
45:25 anti-fragile but really they should be
45:27 thinking about this other thing
45:29 these are all nuances that you could
45:31 just do by writing your own proxy of
45:33 some bigger idea and yeah
45:37 just so just because you know an
45:38 authoritative link on something exists
45:41 doesn't mean that you can't write about
45:42 it
45:43 okay so let me go
45:46 back and try some right to summarize it
45:48 from the the very beginning
45:50 so first we hang out on hacker news
45:53 reddit or whatever see what people are
45:56 interested in
45:56 so pick a topic then we start learning
45:58 in public right so we
46:00 learn this about this topic and we tweet
46:03 about this every day
46:05 so we start understanding it well enough
46:08 then eventually we get hired
46:10 start working in this area and while
46:13 working we can continue doing this
46:14 exploring different things and then if
46:16 there is a new book maybe we can just
46:18 summarize this book and put it out there
46:20 so basically keeping up with uh public
46:22 presence right
46:24 learning yeah public history trends yeah
46:26 anything that you
46:27 you yourself would have found useful
46:28 from like three months ago or six months
46:30 ago
46:31 right right for your own professional
46:33 interests anything that
46:34 will be shared by other people uh
46:37 obviously keeping in mind what they
46:39 want to hear as well yeah because i
46:42 imagine
46:42 um that if you do this because when i do
46:45 something like this when i write
46:46 something
46:48 then the thing i'm writing about it
46:50 really gets into my head so i remember
46:52 this thing a lot better
46:55 so like any concept so if i just learned
46:59 it
46:59 and then even if applied maybe yeah okay
47:02 i know how to use it
47:04 but if i sit down and write about this
47:07 publish a blog post then i remember
47:08 about this thing
47:10 yes this is another thing you probably
47:12 talk about listen your book right oh
47:13 yeah
47:14 yeah yeah it's all nice especially if um
47:18 you uh have your own highlights from
47:20 from a book or a blog post or something
47:23 and you can just use go on google and
47:25 type you know your your domain name and
47:27 then
47:27 and then that search search word it
47:29 gives you you basically use google as
47:31 your own personal search engine
47:33 for uh your notes which is really
47:36 helpful
47:38 when you're trying to look up something
47:39 to reference people um
47:41 but yeah i mean one other thing i
47:43 probably should have mentioned earlier
47:45 is this idea of open source knowledge so
47:49 we used to have encyclopedias where like
47:51 encyclopedia britannica like microsoft
47:52 and karta they would
47:53 hire thousands of editors and and write
47:56 this like
47:58 50 different books on like everything to
48:00 know about on earth
48:02 and then wikipedia comes along with like
48:04 100th of their budget and
48:06 it just destroys all them right and now
48:08 wikipedia is the only encyclopedia
48:10 anyone uses
48:11 um i think we should have a thousand
48:13 different small wikipedias
48:14 um on on every single topic um
48:18 and you mean literally wikipedia like
48:20 media wiki or
48:22 anything anything that anyone can
48:23 contribute crowdsource knowledge
48:26 right that you curate because uh some
48:29 amount of curation is necessary
48:31 but yeah just like wikipedia has editors
48:33 and like some kind of culture of
48:35 contributing that you want to come along
48:36 and contribute
48:37 you want the authoritative source of
48:39 something um open source knowledge is
48:41 this idea that we should
48:42 try to replicate that for anything that
48:44 is
48:47 complicated that has has a reference
48:49 that people need
48:50 um so i just uh so i personally did this
48:53 um when i was learning react and
48:55 typescript uh the react
48:56 team uh they had their own
48:59 typed javascript solution so they were
49:01 not interested in documenting text
49:02 scripts
49:03 the typescript team was focused on being
49:06 framework agnostic so they were not
49:08 going to document react so i documented
49:10 the intersection of reacted typescript
49:12 and and that cheat sheet you know now
49:14 has like 30 000 stars on github
49:16 um and people contribute you know i've
49:18 been taught react inside script
49:20 by people like uber microsoft whatever
49:23 but they've uh they've also i've also
49:26 taught them stuff
49:27 for for free and they they know of me
49:29 through that work
49:30 so that's a little bit of marketing
49:32 myself as well but it is this idea of
49:34 collaborative
49:36 uh knowledge gathering right i i just
49:38 saw this today
49:40 uh where someone actually uh compiled a
49:42 reference
49:43 list of all the header tags in html and
49:46 that was that little says thirty
49:47 thousand stars
49:48 it's just pretty amazing like the the
49:50 kind of things that people just need to
49:51 reference all the time
49:52 if you just keep the list and you you
49:54 let people contribute
49:55 then that automatically becomes part of
49:58 your personal brand and marketing
50:00 and it's just a really nice way to to
50:02 grow because now
50:04 learning is not learning and blogging is
50:06 very solo
50:07 individual activity but if you can build
50:09 a community around the thing that you're
50:11 trying to learn that's even better
50:12 you're going to learn much faster
50:14 i call this the big l notation you know
50:16 how like the o notation you have like
50:18 the scaling factors
50:19 people have different scaling factors
50:21 around their learning as well and
50:23 if you learn with other people then you
50:24 learn at a rate of uh
50:26 l of n times p and this i have a whole
50:29 block was about big l
50:30 but uh there's there's there's a theory
50:32 behind this which which i really like
50:34 and someone saw this link commented on
50:38 this yes
50:38 exactly i also wanted to talk to you a
50:41 bit about
50:42 uh internal marketing so not marketing
50:45 for the outside world but also
50:47 internally the company and i think
50:49 for promotions it can be even more
50:51 important than
50:52 uh promoting outside promotion from
50:55 i mean marketing insight rather than
50:58 marketing outside
50:59 so what is uh what is the best way of
51:02 doing this
51:03 do you have any any recommendations how
51:06 can we promote
51:07 ourselves market ourselves within the
51:08 company
51:10 yeah yeah yeah this is this is a really
51:12 important topic as well um
51:14 uh and in fact probably probably most
51:17 relevant because
51:18 no matter what you have to promote
51:19 yourself internally the main advice here
51:23 is to have a brag document which is an
51:26 idea that i got from julia evans
51:27 of striker at the time um and a bragg
51:30 document is
51:31 a one-page two-page summary of the
51:33 things that you do well
51:35 that you've accomplished at the company
51:36 and just to have it ready at all times
51:38 um because it helps your manager to
51:41 advocate for you
51:43 and whenever like you meet someone in
51:45 senior management and
51:46 they need to know what you've done you
51:49 can just
51:50 share the document with them or verbally
51:52 say it you don't have to
51:53 give them the document you can actually
51:55 just say it and
51:57 having your accomplishments in front of
51:58 you it also helps to serve as like a
52:00 motivational pickup like sometimes when
52:02 you have a bad day
52:03 you can just go back and go like oh yeah
52:04 actually i have some value at this
52:07 company
52:08 um or uh or yeah you know you can also
52:12 essentially make it easy for other
52:14 people to be your advocate right
52:16 so that when even when you're not in the
52:17 room oh what
52:19 this is this is something that people
52:20 say like personal brand is what people
52:22 say about you when you're not in the
52:23 room
52:23 right so if you have a strong personal
52:25 brand then you make it easy for people
52:26 to say the same things
52:28 uh for people to say your top
52:30 accomplishments
52:31 and become your advocates so i think
52:33 that's that's pretty important
52:34 um one simple way that engineers can
52:37 actually do this
52:38 or or do personal marketing
52:41 is within the company is to take
52:43 advantage of demos and standups
52:46 um when people approach standups they
52:49 usually
52:49 approach it from a very routine point of
52:51 view like ah like
52:53 you already have to go stand up again
52:54 and i'll say my thing and then i'll be
52:56 i'll pretend to be interested
52:57 while other people say their thing if
52:59 you turn into enjoying
53:01 enjoying um sorry like a enjoyable
53:03 experience
53:04 where you celebrate accomplishment and
53:06 you actually share
53:07 the accomplishments of others with the
53:09 rest of your company then you're
53:11 seen as a source of positive energy in
53:13 your in your team
53:15 um and yeah you're you know
53:18 when people most companies have like a
53:20 demo day or like a
53:22 sprint showcase or like a hackathon and
53:25 most people don't volunteer
53:27 but if you take that opportunity to
53:28 volunteer you get to put your work and
53:30 your team's work in front of the rest of
53:32 the company
53:33 and people know you better and that
53:36 may seem like not very much but when
53:39 people need you
53:40 they need someone from your department
53:41 they'll think of you first and it's
53:43 always above
53:44 marketing is a lot about getting to be
53:47 first on people's minds because
53:49 you provided some value in the past or
53:52 you like strongly associated yourself
53:53 with some problem that people need
53:56 these are all valuable things within a
53:58 company
54:00 so we have a back document which is a
54:02 one two page summary
54:04 then do demos every time it's possible
54:07 and then network with people right so
54:10 share knowledge with them uh talk to
54:13 them mentor them help them right
54:15 yeah there's a there's more than that uh
54:17 so you can also do a signature
54:18 initiative
54:21 signature initiative signature
54:23 initiative yeah this is a
54:25 tournament uh that i picked up at the
54:26 aws i don't know what other
54:28 companies have it uh but essentially
54:30 like a big project that you
54:31 you you hit on your own um
54:35 that you're known for that like people
54:37 like you know have some success in their
54:39 projects and
54:40 and they see that it basically gives you
54:42 a chance for you to
54:44 to set up to to win uh outside of your
54:47 team
54:47 to show some individual accomplishment
54:49 and leadership
54:51 so one example i can give you is a
54:53 friend of mine matthew gerstmann
54:55 gerstmann he works at dropbox as a
54:57 front-end engineer
54:59 and he's just like a thousand other
55:01 front-end engineers within the company
55:03 but he decided to start a javascript
55:06 guild in his free time
55:07 within the company where he just sent an
55:09 internal newsletter
55:10 uh keeping people informed of the latest
55:13 development javascript
55:14 very routine nothing special but
55:18 you know because it involves javascript
55:19 and it involves people that people
55:21 things that people discuss internally at
55:24 work
55:24 it became a small little community
55:26 within dropbox
55:28 and then it evolved into an internal
55:30 conference where they everyone flew
55:32 together and
55:32 had a whole day where they discussed
55:35 company
55:36 specific issues on internally within
55:38 javascript
55:40 and he became sort of the javascript
55:42 domain expert within
55:43 dropbox it's a huge deal huge deal
55:47 um it's nothing to do with his team he
55:49 just
55:50 created an initiative and then
55:51 management supported him by giving him
55:53 some funding
55:53 and some space to do that um and
55:57 yeah there's so many opportunities to do
55:59 that you know it's it's a really crazy
56:01 uh
56:02 wide open space because people don't
56:04 really take initiative at work
56:07 a lot of people are just like sitting
56:08 back and telling waiting for people to
56:10 tell them what to do
56:10 if you find an opportunity and take
56:13 leadership of it people will give you
56:14 more responsibility
56:16 because they're always looking for
56:17 someone who can take that responsibility
56:19 i'll give you another one zack argyle uh
56:22 used to work at pinterest
56:24 and he was really a real believer in
56:27 the opportunity for progressive web apps
56:29 at pinterest um so at a hackathon he
56:32 actually he was he was actually trying
56:33 to promote pwas and within pinterest for
56:35 a long time
56:36 but actually took a hackathon where he
56:38 was presenting directly to the company
56:40 ceo
56:41 ben silverman where he built a pwa
56:44 clone of pinterest into in two days and
56:47 showed that the metrics were way better
56:48 and it was going to be a very good
56:50 positive performance for for pinterest
56:52 and now uh pinterest is
56:54 the full web app is a pwa and it's
56:57 because of him
56:59 and yeah that kind of initiative no one
57:02 asks you to do it but you just really
57:03 believe that it's good for the company
57:05 uh it turns out it'll be probably good
57:07 for your career as well
57:08 so we can do everything we discussed in
57:11 the first
57:13 part of this interview right marketing
57:16 ourselves
57:17 promoting ourselves to the outside world
57:19 we can do the same thing
57:21 but inside the company right so we can
57:23 just start
57:25 a newsletter inside the company so in
57:27 this case our audience would be
57:28 just the uh the company so hello
57:33 yeah and then you become known for this
57:35 thing inside the company
57:37 right so it's interesting i never
57:40 thought about
57:40 uh so there's this uh how to put it like
57:43 you can basically use the same tricks
57:45 inside as you would use outside yeah
57:48 it's basically the same thing except
57:50 it's a smaller audience so
57:51 uh people you it's good at man good in a
57:54 sense that people have to listen to you
57:56 because
57:57 they work with you
58:02 it's bad when you are overly
58:03 self-promotional right
58:05 okay then then they'll have a negative
58:07 opinion of you and yourself
58:09 okay but if you're actually trying to
58:11 provide them just genuinely like hey
58:12 like
58:13 i try to provide a service or like do
58:14 something beneficial for the company
58:16 people would generally back you
58:17 so yeah uh and it's less competition
58:19 because you're just you're just within
58:21 your company
58:22 and you can talk about more specific
58:24 things and problems that your company
58:26 has that other people outside
58:27 one are not not going to know or you
58:30 cannot talk about it because it's a
58:31 company secret it's a thing right
58:32 so there's just so much space that you
58:35 have within works to
58:36 learn in public as well i think people
58:38 don't appreciate
58:39 how effective that is and ultimately you
58:42 know what i'm trying to do here is
58:44 create a path for people to market
58:45 themselves without being a celebrity
58:47 right this is all about are you just
58:49 getting recognized for the skills that
58:51 you have and
58:52 the interests and the opportunities that
58:54 you deserve
58:56 and uh yeah i mean there's so much
58:58 things that you could be doing
59:00 that don't involve being internet famous
59:02 or anything like that
59:04 do you have any last marketing tips you
59:07 want to share with us
59:08 marketing hacks um speaking
59:12 a lot of people don't speak and
59:15 you can probably have something to say
59:16 and then doing talks and
59:19 and the work involved in making a talk
59:22 actually
59:22 is it's half of the battle and once
59:25 you've done the talk you can send it
59:26 around and i think
59:27 uh people who are established speakers
59:30 not only
59:32 do well by like you know showing
59:34 leadership as
59:35 a speaker in that domain but whenever
59:38 you interview
59:39 that's speaking as well when
59:41 [Laughter]
59:43 so you should practice that as much as
59:44 possible when you don't need it
59:46 so that when you do need it you have
59:48 some experience at
59:49 organizing your thoughts and responding
59:51 to questions
59:53 i don't think i'm the best at it because
59:55 i say i'm a lot
59:57 and i sometimes lose track of what
59:59 people are saying but at least i have
1:00:01 more of an organized
1:00:02 thinking about this because i've written
1:00:04 about
1:00:05 these topics and i just i've a fair
1:00:08 amount of experience now
1:00:09 and doing podcasts and speaking so i
1:00:11 highly recommend people do that because
1:00:13 when the time comes and you need it if
1:00:15 you don't have the practice don't expect
1:00:16 to do very well
1:00:19 okay yeah anything else is it
1:00:22 okay yeah there's more uh there's more
1:00:25 marketing hacks so these are all like
1:00:27 big picture strategy things
1:00:29 but there's specific recommendations
1:00:31 that i end the blog post with
1:00:32 so if anyone wants to check out the blog
1:00:33 post uh they can check it out on my site
1:00:35 i would like it
1:00:36 yes it's wix.io
1:00:40 is it correct and then people can find
1:00:43 you on twitter
1:00:44 somewhere else uh those are the main
1:00:47 channels right now
1:00:49 i have a newsletter but it's on my site
1:00:51 so in case i have
1:00:54 yeah so subscribe to newsletter right
1:00:57 yeah then twitter it's a it's a it's a
1:00:59 work update for me and then i
1:01:01 feature like the top three or four reads
1:01:03 that i have every week
1:01:04 or with a little summary um and
1:01:07 hopefully it interests people like it's
1:01:08 it's been it's been doing pretty well so
1:01:10 uh i like that i just don't
1:01:12 pick a domain right now which is pretty
1:01:14 funny apart from the learning public and
1:01:15 career advice thing
1:01:16 i don't have anything else i have
1:01:18 javascript i have
1:01:20 so that's probably enough because this
1:01:23 is what a lot of people recognize
1:01:25 know you for yeah exactly it's weird
1:01:28 because
1:01:28 i i don't want to do this forever uh
1:01:32 too late but it's done very well and i
1:01:35 like invitations to to speak on these
1:01:38 things
1:01:39 um so i'm happy to do it because i've
1:01:41 it's really changed my own life
1:01:43 and i think it will change other
1:01:44 people's as well
