1:03 okay so
1:06 are you ready
1:08 yeah all good let's start
1:11 okay let's start so this week we'll talk
1:13 about the role of ai product manager and
1:16 we have a special guest today joe both
1:19 joe and i studied on the same program it
1:22 was information technologies for
1:23 business intelligence
1:24 i did this a few years earlier and after
1:27 grade 18 joe worked as a data scientist
1:29 like me like this is what i did after
1:31 graduating
1:32 but
1:33 after working for a couple of years as a
1:35 data scientist joe switched his focus to
1:37 product management and this is what we
1:39 will talk today so welcome to
1:42 thank you lord lexi appreciate it
1:44 yeah thanks for coming so before we go
1:46 into uh our main topic of the role of
1:49 ais ml product manager let's start with
1:51 your background can you tell us about
1:53 your career journey so far
1:56 yeah definitely i think that will help
1:58 the audience as well
2:00 so
2:00 i
2:01 my background is mostly computer science
2:04 engineering i i studied computer science
2:06 engineering uh that was my bachelor's
2:09 uh i think my
2:11 most of my initial interactions was more
2:14 in like pure software development web i
2:16 would say because i
2:18 uh even my studies i was doing a lot of
2:21 websites blogging
2:23 i was into these kind of things like at
2:25 that time
2:26 content writing was like not vlogs
2:28 didn't exist it was mostly you know
2:30 typing content so i was into that so i
2:33 did wordpress php
2:36 and
2:36 pagerank optimization
2:38 social media marketing so
2:41 i think that i did that quite
2:43 quite a lot i would say but it was good
2:46 in i think when i think about it now
2:49 it's actually helped me a lot to
2:50 understand a lot of key concepts like
2:53 basics and
2:54 it was also a time for me to practice my
2:56 what i was learning as well
2:58 then after my graduation actually i
3:01 actually worked as a developer as well
3:03 java development back and
3:06 so i did that and then
3:09 while i was working then this
3:11 opportunity of it4bi came along and
3:14 then i moved
3:15 to europe
3:17 from india and i did the masters and
3:20 after finalizing my master's i worked as
3:22 data science engineer i would say and
3:25 during my master's i did work
3:27 like with ing bank for a while but it
3:29 was more like a small internship but i
3:32 think that would be like maybe
3:34 first formal experience as a product
3:37 manager i would say i was working very
3:39 closely with product management team
3:41 and
3:42 so then after my studies i went back to
3:45 you know data science so i was like yeah
3:48 i think this is what
3:50 uh i wanted to do and that was my
3:52 impression and then slowly realized
3:55 maybe product management is something
3:57 that i would be more
3:59 interested in doing so i always like to
4:01 see the bigger picture of things
4:04 and doing adding more value to the
4:06 business i know that
4:08 data science also does it but it's just
4:11 not sometimes not visible i like to all
4:13 the stuff that product managers are
4:14 doing
4:15 so i i switched into slowly into that
4:18 direction and then i moved to
4:20 uh uk i was working as a product manager
4:23 for revolut
4:24 for two years and then now at global
4:27 again as a technical product manager
4:29 so yeah that's actually my career so
4:32 nothing very surprising uh normal track
4:36 of a software engineer to data science
4:38 and
4:39 some of them continuous data scientists
4:41 but i decided to go into product
4:43 management yeah yeah that's that's
4:45 interesting so you said you worked you
4:47 had a bit of experience when you were an
4:49 intern
4:50 you did a bit of product product
4:52 management right yeah but then you
4:54 thought okay since i'm doing this
4:55 masters uh i wanted to do data science
4:58 so you tried to have that for for a
5:00 couple of years and you then realized
5:02 that
5:03 product management is for you right yeah
5:05 i wasn't sure i know that i liked
5:08 product management but then it's also
5:10 like it's not easy job to get into
5:12 because yeah because it's not like a
5:14 product management it's not something
5:16 that is taught in any university or
5:18 anything right it's something that you
5:19 need to learn by doing so
5:22 uh it wasn't easy as well to get into
5:25 like product management jobs so
5:27 i was just like waiting for the right
5:29 time and right moment to come along
5:31 so
5:32 it was there actually in my mind okay i
5:34 want to do this but i was just not 100
5:37 sure yeah
5:39 okay
5:39 and the main
5:42 driver for you was that you wanted to
5:44 have as you said like you wanted to see
5:46 the bigger picture right not just
5:48 contribute to a specific
5:50 piece of the system but have impact on
5:52 overall think an overall product right
5:54 yeah i think that's also i enjoyed like
5:57 you know going into seeing like bigger
5:59 architectures uh how these
6:02 multiple systems interact with each
6:04 other
6:05 and then you can also set the direction
6:07 where this is going as well which i
6:10 found quite interesting i know like
6:12 people some people like that while some
6:15 others don't like this they want to
6:17 you know focus on that scope smaller
6:19 scope and improve it improve it
6:21 that's fair that's we need people like
6:23 that as well so i just didn't see myself
6:26 doing that yeah
6:28 yeah thanks
6:29 now
6:30 can you tell us more about what does
6:32 global do and what do you do there as a
6:34 technical pm
6:36 yeah sure so globo is
6:39 is originally from barcelona so right
6:40 now but it's based in barcelona so it's
6:43 uh
6:44 it's it was founded in 2015 so
6:47 it's a super app so its main focus is on
6:51 deliver your food but the the mission is
6:54 very simple to give access to anything
6:57 in the city so
6:58 it doesn't matter if it's food if it's
7:00 groceries
7:02 pharmaceuticals
7:04 then you have supermarkets so glow is
7:07 delivering everything so the model is
7:10 the normal flywheel marketplace model so
7:13 you have different sellers trying to
7:14 sell their stuff in like restaurants
7:16 pharmacies
7:17 and
7:18 so that's the model and i think almost
7:22 100 million
7:23 orders are done every year in average uh
7:26 currently operating in almost 20 plus
7:29 countries global and
7:32 my job in global is to lead the team
7:36 that is
7:37 managing the machine learning platform
7:39 so essentially i'm a technical product
7:41 manager there
7:43 defining the vision and direction that
7:46 this platform should be going
7:48 um
7:49 so that helping data scientists in
7:51 deploying different machining models so
7:53 in global we have almost
7:55 i think 50 plus data scientists
7:57 and a lot of data analysts so all of
8:00 them are using machine learning to add
8:02 value to business so
8:04 what my resp my platform is doing is
8:06 essentially
8:07 helping them giving the infrastructure
8:09 to productionize their models faster
8:12 and different tools for managing the
8:15 quality of models etc so uh basically
8:18 identifying what to do with the platform
8:21 how can we improve the platform and
8:25 what what's next you know how we can
8:27 improve it and align it to make it
8:29 better yeah
8:30 and you set lead a team that manages ml
8:33 platform does it mean that you're
8:35 building your own platform or you have
8:37 some other some platform that you manage
8:40 um so
8:42 uh
8:42 we are building our own i mean it's
8:44 in-house solution so essentially i mean
8:47 we have a platform right now so it's
8:49 like it's a legacy platform i would say
8:51 i mean legacy is maybe a bit a harsh
8:53 word to use it's just maybe three years
8:56 older but
8:57 the thing is industry is going so fast
9:00 and the requirements are super high now
9:03 because the platform we right now has
9:05 for instance the training orchestration
9:07 was done in jenkins
9:09 now we are moving slowly into our goal
9:12 and airflow and orchestration is more
9:14 scalable so these kind of things so
9:17 slowly we are improving so
9:19 in the end it's an in-house platform
9:21 though we do integrate third-party tools
9:24 based on the requirements
9:26 uh and
9:27 it's not like hunt we build everything
9:29 depends on vss if you feel like hey this
9:33 capability may not be
9:35 feasible for us to build in-house what
9:37 we do is
9:38 we assess the vendors and say like okay
9:40 let's maybe use that solution and
9:42 integrate with the platform
9:44 is it something that you do as a
9:47 technical product manager or
9:49 uh yeah so essentially my role uh would
9:54 uh will be to take feedback on going
9:56 feedback from data scientists i take i
9:59 discuss with them i have
10:01 i may i may not be speaking to every
10:02 data scientist but i usually speak with
10:04 data sign leads or managers of data
10:06 scientists
10:07 i take their feedback and see what's
10:10 their problems and challenges in using
10:12 the platform that's one way i approach
10:13 it and the second one is use review the
10:16 existing product and what's there in the
10:19 market and where do you stand right so
10:21 you try to understand hey my platform
10:25 is having these gaps and how can we fill
10:27 it so this means you need more
10:29 capabilities in the platform so you come
10:31 in and write the specifications and
10:34 roadmap and
10:35 ensure the deliveries for this
10:37 so
10:38 that's another direction then finally
10:40 as always like a platform you have
10:42 technical depth so which is
10:45 uh which may slow down but it it can
10:48 also be an accelerator so how to manage
10:50 this efficiently and prioritizing this
10:53 to find the right balance to so that the
10:55 business is not slowing down
10:57 you give what data scientists want some
11:00 models may need custom tools you give
11:02 and prioritize what they want while
11:05 meanwhile you also continue improving
11:07 the platform
11:09 interesting and uh
11:11 so this is an internal product right so
11:13 you are not a customer facing team
11:15 so
11:16 what is the main
11:19 idea so why do you have a product
11:21 manager for an internal team
11:24 um yeah that's a very good point
11:27 i think uh
11:28 internal teams even though it's like uh
11:31 internal but in the end
11:33 there is like almost
11:35 i mean hundred plus use people using
11:37 this platform so there is customers for
11:40 this platform and what we need is we
11:43 need to accelerate uh
11:45 [Music]
11:46 the quality of the models we need faster
11:48 time to deployment we need we are
11:51 actually enabling these
11:53 users of the platform to add more value
11:55 to customers right so it's not direct
11:58 correlation but indirectly you are
12:00 actually enabling uh everyone in the
12:03 company actually to deliver more and
12:05 more value to the
12:06 to the customer so that's the one way of
12:08 saying it so
12:10 this
12:11 second one is
12:13 even though it's an internal platform as
12:15 the platform grows you need to
12:17 understand what's your customers uh what
12:19 they need and you also need to look into
12:21 the industry and say hey
12:23 this is what
12:25 we need to do at this right now so we
12:28 need uh someone who can actually
12:31 prioritize what needs to be done and
12:33 what capabilities needs to be there in
12:35 the platform so that's where a product
12:37 manager adds more value there then
12:39 finally to make sure you know all the
12:43 it's a big platform you have different
12:45 requirements coming from different
12:46 stakeholders like
12:48 data scientists have different needs uh
12:50 then business data engineers may have
12:52 different needs and
12:54 then
12:55 apart from that you also have internal
12:58 requests right i need this
13:00 bugs and it needs to be fixed so
13:02 prioritization and understanding hey
13:05 based on all the things that we needs to
13:07 do
13:08 uh product manager is going to assess
13:11 uh what can be done and what's the best
13:13 way to do it so i definitely believe
13:15 even though it's internal platform you
13:17 need product managers at some point uh
13:19 to make it efficient and operate it in
13:22 the right direction um else
13:25 i have seen platforms going in a very
13:28 very messy stage where you have a lot of
13:31 tools lot of capabilities with no one
13:33 knows how to use it and no direction
13:35 being happening yeah
13:37 so that's what happens when an internal
13:39 team a tool tooling team or a platform
13:41 team doesn't have a product manager
13:44 right yeah usually what happens is
13:46 developers may say like hey this tool is
13:48 cool let's integrate it they integrate
13:51 so in the end you will have a platform
13:53 but it is a bunch of tools or libraries
13:56 or bunch of multiple ui's so
14:00 when a person comes in to use this they
14:03 will be like hey what
14:05 where should i start you know even
14:07 though there is documentation you will
14:09 say like hey there is this tool for
14:11 tracking what about this tool
14:13 so there is lack of consistency lack of
14:17 ui
14:18 so in the end what happened is if you
14:20 think about it a data scientist salary
14:23 in average maybe like let's say 4 000
14:25 euros and if the person is struggling to
14:27 use this platform for two weeks
14:30 uh you are actually costing more
14:33 business
14:34 debt and salary is actually let's take
14:37 an example like
14:38 uh two weeks is like maybe 2 000 euros
14:41 so if 50 users are there you are
14:43 actually costing
14:45 maybe 10 000 or 100 000 euros less right
14:47 so if you can think like that then you
14:50 will see like hey why you need actually
14:52 some product managers to fix this yeah
14:55 how do you help to actually so you said
14:57 you prioritize things yeah right you
15:00 collect requirements and then uh
15:02 the requirements come from different
15:04 sources so it can be
15:06 you saw a demo from some external tool
15:08 or somebody complete complain to you
15:11 about something so you take all this
15:13 down then you have like a backlog right
15:15 and then you prioritize the backlog
15:17 how do you do that
15:19 so that prioritization process is done
15:21 with the team the development team so we
15:23 have engineering managers so usually
15:26 product managers work very closely with
15:28 engineering managers and the development
15:31 team itself so
15:32 product managers try to define the
15:35 problem itself what the problem is
15:38 while the definition of the solution
15:41 happens with the engineering team right
15:43 so
15:44 and all this discussions is part of we
15:47 have weekly grooming of backlog so
15:50 product manager runs this session saying
15:52 every every hour sorry every week we
15:55 have an hour where we discuss about hey
15:57 this is the top priorities this is
16:00 and then we decide based on the team we
16:03 follow some agile methodologies or
16:05 something to make sure we have
16:06 deliveries right and once we agreed on
16:10 the backlog and time of delivery we
16:12 communicate back to the stakeholders
16:14 saying
16:15 hey data scientists requested this
16:17 feature i will go back to the data
16:18 scientist saying
16:19 we are actually working on this and we
16:21 will you can expect this to be delivered
16:24 uh in two weeks or four weeks or a month
16:28 interesting and you mentioned one
16:30 interesting thing one important thing
16:32 that your job as a product manager is to
16:34 think about problems so you define a
16:36 problem yeah but then
16:39 you are not thinking about the solution
16:40 so the engineering team thinks about the
16:42 solution
16:43 um right
16:44 well
16:45 yeah it's actually a hard problem it's a
16:47 it's a i mean is it quite a complex
16:50 topic to discuss i mean
16:52 i actually it's the danger of often is
16:55 people
16:56 doesn't really understand the problem
16:58 first and they directly go into
16:59 solutions
17:00 that's very dangerous in my opinion i
17:02 have seen examples where people saying
17:05 to me
17:06 hey i want to solve recommendations and
17:09 multi category recommendations won't
17:11 work i read an article in medium about
17:13 it
17:14 so
17:15 you you can draw into conclusions right
17:17 away and say this solution may not work
17:20 while it is also important that you
17:22 validate your hypothesis
17:24 etc so as product managers what
17:28 what i do is i would only can say what
17:31 would be the desired outcome not the
17:33 solution so
17:35 let's say i want
17:36 the model training time to be reduced by
17:39 x percent so now the class the outcome
17:42 is clear and the metric is clear
17:45 while the engineering team i work with
17:48 will have to come we go back and forth
17:51 now the problem is clear and the outcome
17:53 is clear we just need to find how we
17:55 reach that stage so it's always
17:57 important you define clearly your
17:59 problem
18:00 and what is the outcome and the outcome
18:03 is essentially
18:05 and then how you will measure it it's
18:07 it's i think it's easy to say but i
18:09 think i spend a lot of time in doing
18:11 this
18:12 it's i think kpis right and all that
18:15 like how do you measure that your
18:16 platform is good like how do you measure
18:18 it that you reduce the time that data
18:20 scientists uh spent with your platform
18:23 like it's very hard to track right
18:25 exactly so these things are hard to
18:27 track so you have to build an
18:28 observability metrics uh you need to
18:31 have push
18:32 you know
18:33 more metrics to maybe to data though
18:35 whatever observability tools you are
18:37 using so
18:39 i would say this is an interesting topic
18:41 that itself i think even industry is
18:43 challenged to
18:45 answer sometimes because
18:47 i think uh many of most of the mlaps
18:49 tools in the market don't have this
18:51 answer yet so it's a problem i think
18:54 everyone is trying to solve yeah
18:56 yeah and the question i actually had
18:58 when uh asking that is i know that you
19:01 have a background engineering background
19:03 so you spend some time
19:05 doing java development and you spend
19:07 some time doing data science yeah you're
19:11 not maybe now but some time ago you were
19:13 quite hands-on so you yeah still know
19:17 how to do some things right so you still
19:19 remember you still have this experience
19:21 so how do you make sure you don't jump
19:23 into this solution mode
19:24 as a pm and you don't start recommending
19:27 teams what to do
19:29 yeah
19:30 that's actually a very good question and
19:32 it's also a hardest thing that you
19:34 struggle a daily basis
19:36 because uh first thing is
19:39 uh
19:40 problems uh is i think it's a mindset of
19:44 product where you need actually to
19:46 think more about the problem itself
19:49 and
19:50 for sure i think to jump into solutions
19:53 uh the mistake usually it's because
19:56 sometimes you get too excited about a
19:57 problem so
19:59 so it's not like uh stop being excited
20:01 it's just about uh spending more time on
20:04 understanding the problem itself
20:07 breaking down into it into small pieces
20:09 so that's that's one exercise that helps
20:12 me from preventing me
20:14 from going directly into solutions so
20:15 when you start breaking down your
20:17 problem into smaller pieces and how to
20:19 solve it you essentially understand that
20:22 uh
20:23 hey i cannot think about one solution
20:25 maybe directly it's not the right way
20:27 and right time for me to do it uh i
20:30 essentially should try spend time in
20:33 clarifying this problem and breaking
20:34 down it into small pieces right so
20:37 that's one way of doing it and the other
20:39 one is it i think it takes practice
20:41 right it's a it's consistent effort uh
20:43 sometimes you do that as well and then
20:45 you you will have to
20:47 you know uh
20:49 and be realistic about it and say hey i
20:51 did it i need i need to make sure that
20:53 i'm not doing it anymore right yeah
20:55 interesting and you said you spent a lot
20:57 of time trying to understand the problem
20:59 break it down yeah do you do this alone
21:01 or the whole team is involved how does
21:03 it
21:04 usually look like
21:06 um
21:07 so
21:08 sometimes yes all the old team involves
21:10 then some some of the cases is mostly
21:13 with the actual users uh which can be
21:16 uh it depends on the job i used to do so
21:18 in previous job it was sometimes with
21:21 regulators or compliance managers
21:24 some customers and in right now i'm
21:27 mostly spend some times with data
21:29 scientists to ice take feedback do some
21:32 brainstorming sessions
21:34 it's just maybe just a mirror board
21:36 where we we do an exercise together and
21:38 say like
21:40 hey
21:40 let's go into deeper and we list out all
21:43 the problems we group the problems
21:45 together
21:47 it's usually workshops or
21:50 customer interviews or user interviews
21:52 and
21:54 things like that helps us to
21:56 clarify the problem more so
21:58 mostly speaking i would say
22:00 communicating and understanding that's
22:03 uh that's the way it uh usually it works
22:05 yeah
22:06 so would you say that speaking
22:08 communicating
22:10 also you mentioned prioritization are
22:12 the main skills you need to have as a
22:13 product manager
22:15 ideally yes i think that's that's the
22:18 key drivers as a product managers you
22:20 spend your
22:22 most of your schedule is around
22:24 communications and how do you you spend
22:27 a lot of time in discussions with people
22:29 so it's actually a very important skill
22:31 to have good communication skill and i
22:35 also don't believe that
22:37 everyone from day one have this skill
22:40 right it's it takes time and practice so
22:43 i i would say like
22:45 it's an it's a very important skill and
22:46 prioritization as well is a very key
22:48 skill
22:49 uh which i would say also is not an easy
22:52 thing because i know people it's people
22:55 with 10 or 20 years of product
22:56 management experience still
22:58 spend a lot of time doing this because
23:00 it's not at all easy because you have
23:03 many people with many requirements
23:05 all of them has importance then now you
23:08 need to go back and do your work
23:10 and be realistic in prioritizing things
23:13 what needs to be done and what brings
23:15 value to your customers
23:19 what else do you think are
23:21 what kind of other skills do you need
23:24 at work like in addition to this
23:25 communication and prioritization
23:28 yeah so in my
23:29 specific case being more close to the
23:33 ml cinema world i would say for me it's
23:36 also important to understand the market
23:40 or
23:41 where the industry is going with machine
23:44 learning
23:44 and machine learning ops and
23:48 engineering practices cloud technologies
23:51 uh so uh you need to be constantly
23:53 updated because
23:54 uh one thing is maybe you are you may be
23:57 solving the problem in a really wrong
23:58 way or maybe you're not using the right
24:00 tools right so for this you need
24:02 constant learning of what's happening in
24:05 the industry and
24:07 maybe it could be review of
24:10 some materials or participating in some
24:12 events etc so learning is very important
24:14 i would say
24:16 and the second one is uh also like
24:19 understanding of you know moral
24:20 architectures uh technical
24:23 you know
24:24 how
24:25 maybe it can be like building even
24:26 streaming systems or batched or
24:29 big data related knowledge database
24:32 related knowledge so all this can help
24:34 because you are
24:36 your communications in the end is based
24:38 on these topics so if you if you cannot
24:41 understand or you cannot stay updated
24:43 with it you are actually going to
24:45 struggle a lot as a product manager so
24:47 you need to be really updated with uh
24:49 what's the technologies in the company
24:51 and
24:52 uh how they are using it and
24:54 it could be security related issues from
24:57 it can be wide range of issues so you
24:59 need to have a real good understanding
25:01 of how this works uh else it will be
25:03 like it can be a good a bit of a
25:05 disaster being a product manager who
25:08 communicates a lot but who doesn't
25:10 understand what's happening under the
25:11 hood right so for that learning is quite
25:14 important i would say yeah
25:16 how important do you think is to have a
25:18 technical background for a technical
25:20 product manager like you have like i
25:23 guess all the things you mentioned you
25:24 studied them at 8040i and you probably
25:27 also know them from your work
25:31 so i think
25:33 so
25:34 i we have different kinds of product
25:36 managers can go into that later but in
25:38 my kind of roles i would say it's it's
25:40 very important because in the end uh
25:44 if you are communicating often with data
25:46 scientists you need to understand
25:47 what is model life cycle how does model
25:50 works
25:51 and you need to have understanding of
25:54 algorithms etc so that's very important
25:56 on the other hand you are going back to
25:58 your
25:59 team which is essentially engineers who
26:01 are building a platform so they are
26:03 platform engineers so need you need to
26:05 understand different cloud technologies
26:07 tooling and
26:09 kubernetes and or or whatever
26:11 infrastructure solutions that you're
26:13 using you need to have an understanding
26:14 of this so some of the technologies i
26:17 learned on the fly because in in amid
26:20 use the cloud we used was or redshift uh
26:24 was like a private cloud managed by
26:26 ahmed use itself uh was like openshift
26:29 and etc so
26:31 that you learned there
26:32 then when i went travel it was fully on
26:35 gcp so i was new to gcp at that time and
26:38 you just learn the concepts and
26:40 understand what's gcp offering it could
26:42 be data flow pub sub
26:45 then you come to global we are very much
26:47 using aws so
26:50 now i'm in a new world of aws now so
26:53 it's just a matter of you know uh i
26:56 think in the underlying concept is the
26:58 same but you just need to be really
27:00 aware of what's happening in all this
27:02 as a technical product manager because
27:04 as i i think you will struggle with
27:05 prioritization
27:07 because you won't be understanding what
27:08 to solve uh you will be struggling with
27:11 how to solve it
27:12 uh
27:13 and when solutions are being discussed
27:15 you will feel like hey what's actually
27:17 happening because i don't understand
27:18 anything right so
27:20 in a very platform specific
27:23 uh technical roles i would say yes it's
27:25 very much important
27:29 yeah thanks
27:30 and yeah we have quite an interesting
27:32 question
27:33 um
27:34 actually what you describe is to some
27:36 extent quite similar to what i do
27:39 although i am not a product manager but
27:42 there is some overlap like you know
27:44 discussing architecture then
27:47 talking to data scientists seeing what
27:49 the problems are
27:50 although so my title is uh you know i'm
27:53 on the individual contributor track of
27:55 uh yeah data scientists so like my title
27:58 is principal data scientist and the
28:00 question is that we have is what is the
28:02 difference between the data team lead
28:03 and
28:04 a data pm
28:05 uh in this case i think it's very
28:07 similar to also like what's the
28:09 difference between let's say lead data
28:10 scientist and
28:12 technical ai product manager
28:15 yeah
28:16 so
28:17 first uh i mean
28:20 um the
28:21 i think lead data scientists also are
28:24 managers right if i understand or
28:27 they're alignment always
28:29 so this is like you can think of it as
28:31 individual contributors level let's say
28:33 after senior yeah in some companies it's
28:35 stuff data scientists yeah yeah okay
28:37 yeah now i get it so
28:40 i also work with staff data scientists
28:43 and staff engineers as well so
28:45 uh first thing is
28:48 the main aspect that difference is they
28:50 don't drive a roadmap
28:52 like they don't they may drive the
28:54 roadmap one of the items in the roadmap
28:56 like they may own a workstream or they
28:59 own multiple work streams so
29:01 i think they come in a lot when we are
29:05 defining the solution when i defined
29:07 earlier when i mentioned about the
29:09 solution part
29:11 product managers are
29:12 usually the one who is actually very
29:14 much helping defining the problem and
29:17 the outcome while
29:19 lead or
29:20 staff engineers are the first people who
29:22 actually come to help me to define the
29:25 desired outcome the the solution itself
29:28 usually so that's the first uh first
29:31 main thing the second one is uh i
29:33 actually don't
29:35 really go into the details of quality of
29:39 code or
29:41 i don't go into the details of going
29:43 into reviewing pull requests on a daily
29:45 basis or i don't go into any
29:47 architectural technical architectural
29:49 decision making
29:51 i mean
29:52 i do say my input that's that's always
29:55 welcomed
29:56 while it's not my expected
29:59 responsibility to go and make this
30:00 decision so i think this is done usually
30:03 by the data science leads or staff data
30:05 scientists then also about model
30:07 architecture
30:09 i
30:10 what i will be interested is mostly the
30:12 results
30:13 uh what was your hypothesis and how did
30:15 you test it and what's the outcome of
30:17 your a b test and
30:19 how we add value that would be what i
30:22 will be interested in rather than saying
30:24 me i chose a deep learning model over
30:29 something right so this decision making
30:32 i
30:33 i'm only interested in there in the
30:34 outcome while the lead or the staff data
30:37 scientist is going to actually work on
30:39 um the architecture understanding how i
30:43 translate these problems into actual
30:45 requirements and
30:47 working in yeah and actually the
30:51 question was the difference between the
30:52 data team lead and the data pm i think i
30:55 slightly rephrased it because i was more
30:57 interested in uh yeah you know the
30:59 difference between individual
31:00 contributor and product manager yeah but
31:02 yeah let's say this this data scientist
31:05 this person is a data science manager so
31:08 yeah they are a data team lead or
31:09 whatever you call them so what's the
31:12 difference here apart from you know
31:14 having to manage people
31:15 um as a data
31:17 if it's data pm or just data science
31:20 lead you said yeah let's say data
31:22 science elite
31:24 and then a technical
31:26 machine learning product manager yeah
31:28 sure definitely so
31:30 uh usually uh data science leads
31:34 probably
31:35 will have ownership of multiple
31:38 uh scope within the same product so
31:40 let's say
31:41 a product is for recommendations so the
31:44 recommendations may have multiple types
31:46 of recommendations right so this is a
31:48 bigger scope so
31:49 what i've seen is this data science lead
31:52 on the full direction of this one while
31:54 the product manager is very much focused
31:56 on the customer side of uh hey where
32:01 will in the ui i will pay place this
32:03 recommendation uh how i will work the
32:06 product manager also work with the with
32:08 the ux or designers to design the how
32:11 the this will look look like
32:13 then there is also back-end involved in
32:16 this model process right you need to
32:18 integrate your models into back-end so
32:20 product manager act as the sender point
32:23 of contact for
32:24 that is that is actually
32:27 ensuring the collaboration is happening
32:29 effectively with back end
32:31 and
32:33 data science lead and their data
32:34 scientists as well so that's happening
32:38 then importantly the product manager
32:40 itself defines the rollout strategy so
32:43 let's say i have a model and this model
32:46 is performing really well and when
32:49 should i go into the market so time to
32:51 go to market do we need to campaign do
32:53 any marketing campaigns for it etc this
32:56 is defined by the product manager while
32:58 data science lead
33:00 i mean their input is always welcomed
33:02 but it's not something that they
33:04 actually do on a daily basis then
33:06 sometimes i think in my previous job
33:09 like governance was a big factor
33:11 like
33:13 data science models were regulatory
33:15 models which needed to undergo uh
33:19 an approval of a governance board so it
33:22 was product manager who actually
33:24 collected the results with data science
33:26 leads and that assigned this and go to
33:30 the governance board and say hey this is
33:32 the results and this is the outcome can
33:35 you please approve it and this is the
33:36 business use case so this kind of
33:39 external communications approvals
33:41 governance is monitored by the
33:44 the product manager itself but not data
33:47 science leads
33:48 so that's uh seems like product managers
33:50 have more responsibilities here because
33:52 this is like saying okay
33:54 this should be approved especially when
33:57 it comes to regulations
33:59 uh right so here like the the
34:02 how to say liability or responsibility
34:04 is so much higher
34:06 yeah because that's the ultimate
34:07 decision to go with this model
34:10 exactly so essentially uh it can really
34:13 affect your
34:15 uh regulatory licensing
34:17 or it can be a money laundering rule or
34:20 something so it can actually
34:22 really lead to a huge fines etc so
34:26 for instance i think that what happened
34:28 with zillow everyone is saying now
34:31 but
34:32 similarly for banking it can happen but
34:34 i think only in financial tech i have
34:36 seen this
34:37 deeper
34:38 regulations and governance being in
34:40 place because of the nature of the
34:42 business
34:43 in global no not yet
34:45 i don't think it's a it's a regulated
34:47 but i mean there is regulation for a lot
34:49 of things but it's not like a very
34:51 strict governance process for model
34:53 release yet
34:54 while i think it's people who are
34:56 working in fintech can relate to this
34:59 more i think
35:01 and also as an internal pm maybe you
35:03 don't need to deal with
35:05 or less uh
35:07 deal you need to deal less with this
35:09 kind of things and yeah you mentioned
35:11 like thinking of time to market thinking
35:14 about marketing so i guess this is out
35:16 of scope for you right now
35:18 right now yes uh but i would say still
35:22 uh some of the features and capabilities
35:24 when we release
35:25 um it is also important for me to
35:27 understand who will adopt it and how may
35:30 because we want all the people in maybe
35:33 it's not feasible for everyone in the
35:36 company to adopt a capability of the
35:37 platform
35:38 so
35:40 we need to understand also hey
35:42 who is going to adopt it and when is
35:44 going to adopt it so this is kind of
35:46 time to not market time to stakeholders
35:49 so and how we roll out an adoption so
35:53 and you need to align that with them as
35:55 well so people similar right yeah okay
35:58 except maybe uh the market you have is
36:00 uh yeah exactly slightly
36:03 uh smaller but yeah you have a market
36:06 it's like
36:07 i would say negligible compared to
36:09 millions of users so
36:11 but it's uh but i think these people are
36:13 the hardest because they everyone has a
36:16 say because they
36:18 they they speak to you on a daily basis
36:20 while
36:21 on a customer group you are
36:24 you actually may just release it to beta
36:26 and go into millions of users right away
36:28 and uh so
36:30 yeah there is uh pros and cons in both
36:33 way of thinking yeah
36:36 so
36:37 the question so here when you say
36:39 engineering team do you include data
36:41 scientists in there in the engineering
36:44 team or you talk mostly about back-end
36:46 developers yeah so when i say
36:48 engineering team it's only the
36:51 backend
36:52 engineers right now
36:54 even for my platform the envelopes
36:57 platform that i'm doing
36:58 we do have few two data scientists as
37:00 well currently they are part of the
37:02 engineering team which is not
37:04 vr because it's like i'm still
37:07 structuring the teams there so at some
37:09 point we want the data scientist to be
37:12 in an independent team as well so
37:15 it's an exceptional scenario right now
37:17 that
37:18 the team that i'm working with has two
37:20 data scientists embedded into the
37:22 engineering team but ideally
37:25 in other company in other teams in
37:26 global it's usually engineering team is
37:29 just backend engineers or system
37:31 engineers develop engineers
37:33 and that engineers but they don't really
37:35 have any data scientists a part of the
37:38 engineering team
37:39 and the team you work directly the team
37:41 that builds the platform who are they
37:43 what kind of responsibilities do they
37:45 have
37:46 so roles titles
37:48 yeah so
37:49 we defined the user journey of a data
37:52 scientist so we have
37:54 starting from model training
37:57 uh sorry i would say start with offline
37:59 experimentation so you start with
38:01 experi offline experimentation like what
38:04 notebooks offering infrastructure for
38:06 this
38:07 then you have data management which is a
38:09 huge area you need to integrate with
38:11 data lake data warehouse
38:14 feature store so this data management
38:16 related tooling uh so
38:19 we have back-end engineers building
38:21 tooling around it then some of the data
38:24 quality related tooling like great
38:26 expectations
38:27 integrating these libraries with our
38:29 platform this is done by back-end
38:31 engineers then we have a model training
38:35 infrastructure so we allow
38:37 data scientists to schedule workflows
38:40 for model training which is essentially
38:42 model training jobs which could be
38:43 scheduled and run on a daily basis or
38:46 weekly based on the business requirement
38:48 so this has underlying infrastructure
38:50 which is kubernetes because we are using
38:52 argo right now so this has system
38:55 engineers uh or people with kubernetes
38:58 knowledge which is usually system
38:59 engineers uh managing this
39:01 and
39:02 we also use some then once the model is
39:05 trained you need to go into deployment
39:06 phase so
39:08 the model needs to be productionized so
39:10 it could be served via an api
39:12 or it could be a
39:15 basic consumption of key value store
39:17 like you know it's a batch patch
39:18 consumption or reinforcement learning
39:20 based approaches as well so all this
39:23 requires like you know ci cd pipelines
39:26 which is probably jenkins plus we also
39:28 have spinnaker for it so
39:30 all this is managed
39:31 within the platform and any bugs in this
39:34 is fixed by these engineers
39:37 so when a data scientist is trying to
39:38 deploy something if something breaks we
39:41 will have an internal help center which
39:44 they raised a ticket to us saying hey
39:45 this is an issue if it's a high priority
39:48 we prioritize it straight away and try
39:50 to fix it so it's a mixture of system
39:53 engineers backend engineers and
39:56 we don't have a service but at some
39:58 point yes we would like to have to
40:00 maintain the infrastructure part yeah
40:03 okay and you mentioned that also there
40:05 are a couple of data scientists who take
40:06 care of offline experiments do they take
40:08 it
40:09 do they understand it correctly or they
40:11 are more like users and they are not in
40:13 your team
40:14 so we have couple of data scientists
40:16 they actually not just they don't own
40:18 any particular user journey right now
40:22 but they also very focus on tooling
40:24 like data science tooling uh for
40:27 instance av testing tools um then
40:31 data quality tools then we have a
40:34 library which core library of the
40:36 platform they manage the score library
40:39 then there is also some we offer
40:41 out of the box i would say the core
40:44 library of the platform also have
40:45 integrations with standard bs libraries
40:47 like nambi pandas
40:49 so
40:50 different libraries they use so all of
40:52 this is managed by data scientists and
40:55 at some point they also act as
40:57 i would say
40:59 accelerators like power users of the
41:01 platform so
41:02 let's say another data scientist is
41:04 joining the company and he have a new
41:06 model when they try to use our platform
41:09 these data scientists are more like you
41:10 know consultants to them saying hey this
41:12 is how you should do it
41:14 uh
41:15 they will help with the best practices
41:17 in the platform uh sort of guiding them
41:19 through
41:20 uh
41:21 using the platform in an effective
41:23 manner
41:24 like deaf
41:26 developer gates right
41:28 yeah exactly so it's more like developer
41:30 advocates but they also do some modeling
41:32 actually last i think yeah they also do
41:34 some modeling for internal
41:36 purposes so we have some dummy models we
41:39 test which we use
41:41 for instance uh recently one of them did
41:43 a model for predicting how many jira
41:45 tickets we're gonna get
41:47 on a weekly basis very simple model but
41:50 it's just used for us to you know manage
41:52 the life cycle of the platform so we can
41:55 use this for tutorials and writing up
41:58 demos etc
42:01 interesting so you mentioned jira
42:02 tickets and then there is a comment that
42:04 uh
42:05 scrum doesn't work for data science
42:08 projects so you know what's the best way
42:10 to manage data science projects
42:13 um
42:13 there is no best
42:16 i think i don't think there is like one
42:18 answer to this it's i think
42:21 it's very
42:22 subjective to the team the company the
42:25 culture
42:26 and
42:27 you need to try different methodologies
42:29 when i joined
42:31 i mean when i started in lovely there
42:33 was nothing like i was
42:35 my job was to build a team and
42:36 everything so
42:38 we weren't doing any scrum or anything
42:39 we were just having a to-do list then we
42:42 reached the stage okay now we have a few
42:44 people let's maybe do kanban
42:47 like we just have a high priority list
42:49 and we just do then we reach the stage
42:52 that okay now we are in governance we
42:54 need to make releases
42:56 okay let's do scrum so
42:58 it's it's i think it's an iterative and
43:00 adaptive process and
43:03 i don't think that's a
43:05 i personally don't think it's good to
43:06 say that hey this is not gonna work
43:08 without trying
43:09 uh something and scrum has been there
43:12 for maybe 20 years
43:14 so and it's used
43:16 and it can work i know places it doesn't
43:19 work so
43:21 so it's like uh
43:23 it's like in to understand understand
43:26 what's actually the team need of the
43:27 team
43:29 and maybe some teams are research
43:31 oriented research r d teams they may not
43:34 need scrum actually it's true so
43:36 but it depends on the scope of the
43:38 business and where you are and how you
43:40 want to deliver
43:42 and
43:43 yeah that's i i think my personal take
43:45 on this one
43:47 i haven't worked in scrum like in fire
43:49 for six years
43:50 but
43:51 what i remember is the main problem with
43:53 this is like data science projects are
43:56 usually not very deterministic so it's
43:58 sometimes hard to say okay this will
44:01 take you know five straight points or 20
44:03 story points right yeah yeah
44:05 so that's i guess the main problem so
44:08 and then at the end of this sprint uh
44:10 you say oh yeah
44:11 that didn't work
44:12 yeah yeah yeah i understand what you
44:15 mean uh then
44:17 it depends so i think
44:19 then you have you can i mean i am just
44:21 saying about agile practices you can try
44:23 kanban maybe then it may work
44:25 it's just like you don't need to size
44:27 all the points so
44:29 it does like that's why we have
44:30 retrospectives we speak with the team to
44:32 understand
44:33 hey what's working and what's not
44:35 working so
44:36 and product managers should also do this
44:38 because
44:39 uh
44:40 in the end the delivery it's affecting
44:42 the delivery so you need
44:43 a high quality delivery and with the
44:46 everyone in the team being satisfied
44:48 satisfied about it so i think product
44:50 managers have very important
44:52 responsibility in doing that as well
44:54 yeah
44:55 yeah thanks
44:57 i'm quite interested actually in your
45:00 career journey in your transition so
45:02 when you decided okay now i want to have
45:05 larger impact so i
45:08 want to do less hands-on work and focus
45:10 more on you know defining problems
45:12 rather than solutions yeah so from the
45:14 moment when you realized this to the
45:16 moment when you got your first job offer
45:19 as a
45:20 product manager so what did you do there
45:23 like how this looked like for you
45:25 um
45:26 so i actually started
45:28 like
45:29 being into product management maybe
45:31 three years or four years before i
45:34 started my first job so i was in
45:37 different communities in product
45:38 management
45:39 i read a few books about product
45:41 management
45:43 i was
45:44 constantly reviewing
45:47 all these talks that there was something
45:49 like product school i think now it's
45:50 very popular so they were doing like
45:53 something like what you are doing for
45:55 data science they were doing it for
45:56 product so
45:58 there was a lot of product managers
45:59 coming from google facebook speaking
46:01 about product management
46:03 and then i think i closely worked with
46:05 few product managers like to understand
46:08 how they are doing the solutions and
46:09 everything
46:10 so
46:12 so slowly i realized that i also did a
46:15 lot of product management as a when i
46:17 was doing my blogging like when i was
46:19 maintaining my own website i realized
46:21 it's slowly like hey you actually did
46:23 some product management before because
46:25 you are building a ui which is used by
46:28 quite a few people and you were trying
46:30 to make revenue out of it by placing ads
46:33 in the right places
46:35 and
46:36 so
46:36 and then even in data science life cycle
46:39 you are you spend a lot of time
46:41 understanding the business so
46:44 you actually are doing some amount of
46:46 product manager product management
46:48 already it's just like how do you take
46:50 it into the you know next level so i
46:52 just
46:53 translated all what i did into a product
46:58 mindset
46:59 to say that hey i built websites that
47:03 was having x number of visitors
47:06 and
47:06 that generated this
47:09 amount of revenue and
47:11 i just updated my
47:13 cv with like that and then
47:15 then i thought about the data science
47:17 projects i did so for instance i was
47:19 working for a chat board project so i
47:21 was actually collecting the requirements
47:23 i was speaking to the person all the
47:25 time because there was no product
47:27 manager then i was leading the products
47:30 uh for the six months in the in the end
47:32 i delivered the output as a chatbot so
47:35 then i took feedback from him so and you
47:37 build metrics to monitor it like
47:40 what was the satisfaction score of the
47:42 chat board what is the send event score
47:44 of chat board so
47:46 when you think about it you actually did
47:48 some product management there so all
47:50 these projects i correlated into
47:52 something more like product management
47:54 and
47:55 then i when i had the confidence like
47:58 like i knew that i applied for a job
48:00 that i was like not literally qualified
48:03 for because i was not i'm for sure was
48:05 under qualified but i gave a try still
48:08 and at that time revolute was quite open
48:11 about these things and they wanted
48:14 someone with data science background and
48:17 it was quite hard to find as well so i
48:19 had a plus point there to go in and
48:22 it helped and
48:24 actually it was like
48:26 uh i don't know it took some time i
48:28 would say to prepare for it and to
48:30 translate everything into product
48:32 mindset a lot of reading speaking with a
48:35 lot of people understanding
48:37 and as i said you can't you cannot learn
48:39 product management just by reading you
48:41 need to do it so i did some ex projects
48:44 as well which helped me to you know
48:47 communicate that i was doing x and
48:49 delivering what value as well
48:51 so
48:52 yeah i think that was a simple process
48:54 yeah i mean i can't say simple but that
48:56 was the process yeah
48:58 okay so basically as a data scientist
49:00 you're already in a quite good position
49:03 to
49:05 move more into the business side of
49:07 things into the product side of things i
49:09 think because as a data scientist you
49:11 have to do these things you have to
49:12 understand your domain you have to you
49:14 know work closely with product managers
49:17 and then you can just do more of that
49:20 and yes eventually you know partner with
49:22 your product manager eventually maybe
49:25 take a part of their responsibility and
49:27 then yeah that okay yeah exactly so
49:29 that's how i transitioned as well like i
49:32 was
49:32 uh exactly doing the same
49:35 and then you said you it took some time
49:38 to prepare you did some reading
49:40 do you remember what kind of reading you
49:42 you did what did you do um yeah so
49:44 there's like i mean there's like how
49:46 like a book i mean it's like how to
49:48 crack pm interview it's like it's how to
49:51 crack code in coding interview i read
49:53 coding interview and i was applying for
49:56 engineering jobs and then now after that
49:58 i read the pm interview on then the i
50:01 think there is a lot of material out
50:03 there about product management because
50:05 uh especially from product managers from
50:08 all these scale-up startups uh doing a
50:11 lot of stuff so i
50:13 i think how to crack pm interview was
50:16 one thing that helped then i think
50:18 uh lean lean
50:20 i think there's a lean startup book by
50:22 eric
50:23 reese i think so i think that mentions
50:26 about the importance of measuring things
50:29 and going in a lean philosophy which is
50:31 a very key value and importance in
50:34 product management right
50:36 because
50:38 and the other thing is constantly i
50:40 think i also listened to a lot of people
50:42 speaking stuff for instance uh as i
50:44 mentioned about not jumping right into
50:47 solutions another important thing is you
50:49 shouldn't
50:50 uh do a lot of assumptions also in
50:52 product management so these kind of
50:54 things you learn by doing and listening
50:56 to people so because we are wired to do
50:59 assumptions but i have seen assumptions
51:02 one wrong assumption making a lot of bad
51:06 business issues so these kind of things
51:09 you only learn by
51:12 doing stuff and observing things and
51:14 speaking to people so you learn from
51:16 experience as well over time yeah
51:19 okay so
51:20 as a data scientist get more into
51:23 uh
51:24 doing pairing with your product manager
51:26 then read the cracking pm interview and
51:29 then lean start a book and then just
51:31 talk to product people right that's uh
51:34 yeah that's the summary
51:35 yeah that's a small summary i would say
51:37 because do this for two years right yeah
51:40 i mean it took two three years of this
51:42 is like two years of what i did for
51:44 summarize i think it's also at some at
51:46 somewhere it's also if your depends on
51:48 your manager as well once you start into
51:50 product career if your manager is quite
51:52 good uh
51:53 he can be your mentor as well because
51:55 he's if you if he's giving you good
51:57 feedback
51:58 if not you should find definitely
52:00 someone to mentor you
52:02 uh because uh it's important i would say
52:05 to have a good product vendor um then i
52:09 think airbnb chief product officer i
52:11 forgot his name he writes a lot in
52:13 product management as well so i follow a
52:14 lot of product people around
52:17 uh in my linkedin and in social network
52:20 as well so i get random thoughts here
52:22 and there you know
52:24 uh on a timely basis so which is like
52:26 food for thought which is important as
52:28 well
52:30 okay thanks and what do you think about
52:32 people who do not work as data
52:35 scientists right now or engineers can
52:38 they become machine learning product
52:39 managers
52:42 um
52:44 i mean
52:45 traditional
52:46 i i mean it's more easier for them to be
52:49 a traditional software engineering pm i
52:51 would say
52:52 because uh
52:54 when you go into like writing
52:56 specifications
52:57 uh
52:58 understanding requirements
53:01 then if they have some understanding of
53:03 machine learning philosophy yes it will
53:05 work
53:06 but right 100 like you know immediate
53:09 transition may not be that easy but i
53:12 would never say a hard note to it
53:13 because i think some people are very
53:16 good in learning stuff so
53:17 if they can learn the philosophies and
53:19 understand how an ai project is
53:21 structured
53:22 uh i think they can do it as well
53:24 because it's in the end most of the
53:27 things i mentioned or i do as a ai
53:30 product manager
53:32 i think 80 percent is same as normal
53:34 product management
53:36 it's just that that 20 percent
53:38 where i add more value with my
53:40 background uh if you are an engineer you
53:43 already you could add it it's just like
53:45 you may need to
53:47 learn a bit more about ai product
53:48 management so this shouldn't be stopping
53:51 you from applying into a ml product
53:53 management job that's just my
53:56 personal take then it depends on
53:59 companies because some companies they
54:00 are like hey i want someone
54:03 like this this this
54:06 then some of them are more flexible so
54:09 you need to find people who are going to
54:11 trust you to give you that kind of you
54:13 know opportunities
54:15 and you mentioned that you applied for a
54:17 job that you weren't qualified for so i
54:20 guess you never know when you read a job
54:22 description
54:23 if uh people are there on the other side
54:26 of the job application
54:28 are actually giving you can give you you
54:30 know this uh opportunity to learn or not
54:32 so the only way to find out is just to
54:34 apply and see yeah that's right
54:36 definitely definitely i think that's the
54:38 philosophy i i also like when i was
54:40 applying to revolut i really liked the
54:42 product i was i was using it for two
54:44 years
54:45 so
54:46 when they started to speak to me i knew
54:48 about the product a lot and they knew
54:51 that i have clear
54:53 passion to
54:54 do something to their business in a good
54:56 way so which was more than helpful as a
54:59 product manager
55:00 uh
55:02 to me to join there right so i think
55:05 sometimes uh if you have clear you can
55:07 clearly showcase your passion and your
55:09 interest into this domain uh i think it
55:13 is possible uh to crack into this yes
55:16 yeah interesting thanks
55:18 um yeah we have
55:19 quite a few questions i don't think we
55:21 will be able to cover all of them but
55:23 let's try to cover at least a couple so
55:25 there is a question from eva
55:27 the question is how do you deal with
55:29 user research
55:31 and result
55:33 and how does it influence
55:35 your work
55:37 my research
55:39 yeah so how do you deal with user
55:41 research so do you use research at all
55:44 yeah so
55:46 user research here i'm assuming it more
55:48 like will be for me the data scientists
55:50 and
55:51 how they are using the platform so
55:53 uh we do have i mean right now what i do
55:56 is i speak with the data scientists and
55:58 data science leads on a monthly basis we
56:01 have
56:02 follow-up sessions with them about
56:04 feedback then we do constantly
56:07 surveys like once in every two months
56:09 about feedback which capabilities are
56:11 being used
56:13 then what we do is we produce something
56:14 called a happiness report like for the
56:17 internal platform so let's let's say for
56:20 this platform our customers are liking
56:22 these features they are using these
56:24 features while they have complaints
56:25 about
56:26 usually it's about documentation lack of
56:28 this quality lack of stability in
56:31 certain areas so then we come back i
56:33 share this with the team and say like
56:35 hey these are the feedback we got
56:37 how can we work on it so when i
56:40 prioritize my objectives or key results
56:42 for next quarter or even for sprint i
56:44 try to address some of these challenges
56:46 uh in in an ongoing way so
56:50 use and it's also an objective of my
56:52 product as well to
56:54 increase the usability of the platform
56:56 so constantly we speak to the customers
56:58 and understand what the users
57:00 need and then
57:02 we translate that into our objective as
57:04 well so we do some initiatives to keep
57:06 it up
57:09 thanks another question from eva is
57:12 what do you think about quality
57:14 assurance
57:15 people and what is their role
57:17 in ml products
57:19 um
57:19 we
57:20 don't have
57:21 qas
57:23 in in the last two companies i worked
57:26 like qas as qs like typical qs defined
57:29 on the core question correctly because
57:32 uh usually
57:33 we expect
57:35 so in revolute the expectation is
57:37 or that the engineers and data
57:39 scientists and mles they should do the
57:41 qa of their own code right
57:44 so
57:45 and as a product manager what i did is
57:47 to
57:48 have a checklist for release so
57:51 especially when my product was a was a
57:54 governance product
57:55 there was i would say five different
57:58 benchmarkings to be passed
58:00 to go a model into production for that
58:03 each model so let's say you have a new
58:05 version of your model what we did is we
58:07 tested it for the historical data for
58:10 like maybe six months how the model is
58:12 performing and uh over the historical
58:14 data then we took some industry public
58:17 benchmarks
58:18 for the same use case we validated that
58:21 and then we also had a labeled
58:23 gold data set as well
58:25 then we have the results from shadowing
58:28 in the in the production with actual
58:30 live traffic so
58:32 we had this quality control process for
58:34 models which
58:36 we worked like myself and my data
58:39 science team i worked with them to
58:41 create a process
58:43 so that was a quality control so every
58:45 model and every version when we create
58:47 this
58:48 we test it for this and we slowly roll
58:51 out so that's the quality control for
58:53 what we did for my last job and here in
58:56 the platform team is usually the
58:58 engineers itself they write their own
59:00 tests and
59:01 we try to make sure we have good test
59:03 coverage and
59:05 everything so
59:07 yeah i think in the end i don't think
59:10 everything is perfect
59:11 it's like
59:13 people do have bugs i think if you don't
59:15 do bugs i don't think you are
59:17 not doing your job correctly i think
59:21 okay yeah thanks do you have a couple of
59:23 more minutes yeah sure sure so yeah so
59:26 there is another question also from eva
59:28 thanks eva for asking questions so the
59:30 third one so do you have any tips for
59:33 somebody for who is working let's say as
59:35 a scrum master right now who is totally
59:38 new to machine learning
59:39 and they need now to support machine
59:42 learning team so do you have any advice
59:45 for them
59:46 no what they can do to support their
59:48 teams better
59:50 um
59:51 i am not sure i understood the question
59:53 correctly but
59:55 um so scrum master usually
59:57 if i understand the role it's mostly
59:59 about running the agile practices right
1:00:01 so
1:00:02 which is what i also do sometimes like
1:00:05 as a product manager
1:00:07 so
1:00:08 i think to extend if it's to extend the
1:00:10 scope it's just you need to work to take
1:00:13 more
1:00:14 time in the
1:00:16 part of problem definition with product
1:00:17 manager to define the problem properly
1:00:20 because as a scrum master you are
1:00:22 already quite experienced in delivering
1:00:25 the product and you know how to do it
1:00:27 you know how to prioritize your backlog
1:00:29 so which is a great asset for any good
1:00:31 pm because usually
1:00:34 uh even though agile philosophies is not
1:00:37 directly mentioned in pm interviews some
1:00:40 of the companies or every company value
1:00:43 it a lot to have a good agile uh
1:00:45 background or you know how to fix your
1:00:48 final prioritize your backlog or
1:00:51 how can i
1:00:52 deliver
1:00:54 let's say a roadmap so this is very
1:00:56 important and then i think an extension
1:00:58 is
1:00:59 you will think about how to now create a
1:01:01 roadmap rather than someone creating it
1:01:03 for you
1:01:04 so
1:01:05 you can create you can again need to
1:01:07 work there with your pm to say that hey
1:01:10 maybe for this project i can create a
1:01:12 roadmap
1:01:13 and i can deliver it so it's just i
1:01:15 don't think the transition is super hard
1:01:17 because i have seen a lot of strum
1:01:19 masters coming into
1:01:21 uh product management
1:01:23 um and also a lot of business business
1:01:26 analysts uh coming into product
1:01:28 management
1:01:30 yeah but if you want to become a machine
1:01:32 learning product management and you also
1:01:34 need to learn a bit of machine learning
1:01:35 exactly so you you definitely need to
1:01:38 learn machine learning as well
1:01:40 yeah
1:01:42 okay yeah thanks i think we should be
1:01:44 wrapping up is there anything else you
1:01:45 would like to mention before we finish
1:01:49 um
1:01:50 no i just no i just wanted to say like
1:01:53 thanks a lot you know for
1:01:55 inviting me to share it's uh also about
