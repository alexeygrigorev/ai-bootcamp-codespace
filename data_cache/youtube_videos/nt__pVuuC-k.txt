0:57 product manager
0:59 and we have a special guest today sarah
1:01 sarah is a product manager at miroxa a
1:04 company building a data platform that
1:06 helps software teams orchestrate and
1:08 integrate data into their data-driven
1:11 applications
1:12 in her previous
1:14 life can i say previously sarah worked
1:17 as a product designer for companies
1:19 included including sora checker
1:23 change.torque and zendesk welcome sarah
1:26 thank you
1:28 before we go into our main topic of
1:30 becoming a data product manager let's
1:33 start with your background can you tell
1:34 us about your career journey so far
1:37 yeah um where do i even begin uh
1:40 so i guess i can start with um i've made
1:44 a lot of transitions in my career but
1:46 one thing
1:47 i've always known is that i wanted to
1:48 work in technology and for me that entry
1:51 point was
1:53 actually a technical support role at a
1:55 large shared hosting
1:57 company
1:59 after
2:00 a handful
2:01 of years in that role i felt pretty
2:04 stuck
2:06 that company was based in utah while
2:08 there is quite a bit of opportunity
2:11 there and technology it just there
2:13 wasn't as much as i had hoped for there
2:15 wasn't a variety of companies that i
2:16 could like say hey
2:18 you know i can work for this company and
2:20 learn something new um so a good friend
2:23 at the company that i was working with
2:24 actually convinced me to move to san
2:26 francisco and said hey if you want
2:29 opportunity like san francisco is the
2:31 place to be
2:32 i'm moving out there he had just
2:35 received an offer to work at a cloud
2:36 computing company and he's like come out
2:38 with me and like we'll figure it out
2:40 together
2:41 so i did the unthinkable and i literally
2:44 it was literally a decision that i made
2:46 within two weeks i packed up all my
2:48 stuff and we literally drove out in the
2:51 middle of a winter storm
2:54 and moved to san francisco um
2:58 when i arrived in san francisco
3:00 i didn't have anything lined up but i
3:02 was comfortable with that um
3:05 through generosity of just friends and
3:07 connections i was able to pick up a few
3:09 like technical gigs here and there and
3:11 eventually you know i'm gonna fast
3:13 forward
3:14 i eventually landed a product support
3:16 role at a company called zendesk
3:19 and that's where my career actually made
3:21 the biggest shift
3:24 so at the time
3:26 i had already been working with a lot of
3:28 companies that use zendesk for their
3:30 help desk and helping them i guess like
3:34 curate their help desk experiences so
3:37 they could help their customers and so i
3:39 was
3:39 working a lot around like helping them
3:42 design experiences that could then like
3:44 ultimately result in like oh customers
3:46 know where to go in order to get this
3:48 information this information and help
3:49 them brand that experience and make it
3:52 you know a bit more familiar um
3:55 i
3:56 ended up reaching out to the chief
3:58 creative officer at the time
4:00 and i was actually trying to refer a
4:02 friend for a design position
4:04 but i had mentioned to him that i
4:07 was i had a passion for design
4:09 and technology and i showed him just a
4:11 few of the projects that i had worked on
4:13 and fast forward i was suddenly in a
4:15 room interviewing for a product design
4:17 role and i got it
4:20 um which was
4:23 a huge opportunity and was just i feel
4:25 so
4:26 lucky um and from there my career grew
4:30 um i went on to work for
4:33 a b2c company called change.org so they
4:36 are one of the world's largest online
4:37 petition platforms
4:39 uh i then went to work for a company
4:41 called checker which is a background
4:43 check api company
4:45 um
4:47 and then i worked for a couple early
4:49 stage companies
4:50 so soraa which is an hr data platform
4:53 and then i arrived here at maroxa
4:57 yeah that's quite a journey
5:00 yeah so
5:01 what did
5:02 like as a designer what kind of things
5:05 so when i hear designer i imagine
5:06 somebody who is
5:08 designing furniture or how
5:10 your apartment should look like is it i
5:13 imagine that it's a different kind of
5:15 designer right so what kind of things
5:17 you needed to take care of like how
5:19 elements are arranged on the website
5:22 things like this yeah um so i love i
5:26 love you know
5:27 interior design and all of that um
5:30 but the the type of product or the type
5:32 of design i was doing was product design
5:35 and so a lot of that was taking product
5:37 requirements and building
5:40 user experiences through interface
5:42 design
5:43 so
5:44 that involves quite a bit of user
5:46 research user testing
5:48 figuring out how customers you know
5:51 expected to interact with our technology
5:54 the outcomes they were expecting and you
5:56 know iterating a billion times trying to
5:59 figure out what was it that you know
6:01 helped our customers along
6:03 um
6:05 yeah
6:06 so do you have to be good at
6:08 design like do you have to have a good
6:10 taste uh to be a product designer
6:14 uh i think i think you have to have like
6:17 a foundational understanding of
6:18 technology
6:20 you need to really care about customers
6:22 about the people that you're serving i
6:24 feel like
6:26 the
6:26 more visual aspects that come in that
6:28 play a part in product design all of
6:30 that can be learned depending on the
6:32 size of the company you can usually get
6:34 away with like using an existing design
6:37 system or component library so you don't
6:40 have to worry too much about like oh
6:41 well what color should this button be or
6:44 you know what kind of you know display
6:46 should i use for this um and so i would
6:49 say like
6:50 yes you should have an eye for design um
6:53 but it really comes down to you the best
6:55 designers i've always known are the ones
6:56 that you know
6:58 are
7:00 their interests are deeply rooted in
7:01 solving problems for their customers
7:04 and what do you do now as a data product
7:07 manager
7:09 that's a great question um i work
7:11 actually pretty similarly to how a
7:14 regular product manager would work
7:16 i guess the only difference here is is
7:18 i'm working on data products and not
7:20 just feature products or what people
7:23 traditionally think of as future
7:24 products
7:25 um so i do a lot of similar work around
7:28 like spending time understanding
7:30 customers
7:32 for me as a pm working on data products
7:34 that means talking with and interacting
7:37 with data professionals any chance
7:39 i get and
7:41 the goal behind that is to
7:43 understand things like what are the core
7:45 responsibilities what are the problems
7:47 that you're aiming to solve what
7:49 challenges do you run up against how do
7:51 you get around them
7:52 and for
7:53 for a lot of my conversations like they
7:55 often go towards more tactical aspects
7:57 of how they take requirements from all
7:59 over the business and turn it into
8:01 actionable data and when i say
8:03 actionable data i mean like data that's
8:05 driving their applications or
8:06 infrastructure or in some cases used in
8:09 data analysis
8:11 um and from there like i take
8:14 a lot of my learnings from those
8:15 conversations or any other information i
8:17 might have
8:18 and start developing an understanding of
8:20 the problem that we're trying to solve
8:22 and date and how we might do that and
8:23 help them accomplish that
8:25 and the thing i found specifically with
8:27 like data teams is that
8:30 not everything i learned necessarily
8:32 points to an obvious answer
8:34 um i find that
8:35 you know depending on the type of
8:37 company the type of you know
8:40 requirements you know that they lay in
8:42 front of their data team really
8:44 determines how that team operates and
8:46 like what the organizational motions are
8:48 for that team like
8:50 are they you know
8:51 um
8:52 just building pipelines for data
8:55 analysis or are they you know power in
8:57 their applications
8:59 um with real time data and why like why
9:01 is that
9:02 um
9:03 so
9:04 from there like i i basically take all
9:07 that information occasionally i will
9:10 you know reach for some of the tools
9:11 that they're using um to kind of figure
9:13 out like okay what's not working here
9:15 what are some of the pitfalls some of
9:17 the technologies and tooling that
9:19 they're using
9:20 um and from there like i take all those
9:24 findings i
9:26 you know present it to the internal
9:28 stakeholders and partners that i have
9:29 within our company
9:31 um
9:31 and we align on whether or not this is
9:33 the right problem to be solved or if
9:35 there's something more that we
9:37 discovered so basically it's just like
9:38 understanding
9:40 you know
9:41 data teams and how they operate
9:44 and then formulating a hypothesis on
9:46 like the problems that they're
9:47 experiencing
9:48 and then you know further
9:50 ideating on a couple solutions and how
9:52 we think we can help them
9:54 um we're formulating like new approaches
9:58 yeah that's quite interesting i
10:01 know nothing about product designers but
10:04 what you described your responsibilities
10:06 as a product designer previously that
10:09 you would also do a lot of user research
10:11 that would involve talking to users and
10:12 then understanding their problems and
10:14 then thinking how you can actually solve
10:16 these problems right
10:18 or maybe i miss in the studio but it
10:22 seemed to like there are some
10:23 similarities between what you're doing
10:25 now and what you were doing previously
10:26 as a product designer is it right
10:29 yeah yeah absolutely so oftentimes you
10:33 know product designers and product
10:35 managers work in close collaboration
10:37 during this phase this i guess you can
10:39 call it product discovery phase where
10:41 you know we're really getting in the
10:43 weeds with some of our customers or
10:45 potentially prospective customers to
10:47 understand like what is it that you know
10:50 they're trying to do what is the problem
10:52 and just like validate some of our
10:54 assumptions around the solution that you
10:56 know we will eventually embark
10:58 on this product discovery phase
11:02 what are the other phases there
11:06 uh so following product discovery um is
11:09 really just about
11:12 it's not just the you know the customer
11:15 development piece there's also like
11:16 market research like
11:18 researching the tooling as i had said
11:20 before sometimes it's a little bit of
11:22 like data analysis if we have data at
11:25 our disposal to kind of formulate an
11:27 understanding of the problem
11:29 um
11:30 and when you say like what's the rest of
11:32 the process do you mean like
11:34 as a product designer or like as a
11:36 product manager well i guess like you
11:39 said product discovery phase i thought
11:40 okay it's just maybe phase number one
11:42 there could be other phases i assume
11:45 there is some sort of process
11:47 um so first you do product discovery and
11:49 then you do probably some other things
11:51 so yeah
11:54 um
11:54 so then we go into the process of like
11:57 planning with the team so a lot of that
11:59 you know i kind of covered where we
12:01 present our findings to stakeholders and
12:03 partners we kind of rely on whether or
12:05 not the problem we're trying to solve is
12:06 the right problem
12:08 and from there like if the team is
12:09 aligned and everything's a go we go into
12:12 the process of working
12:13 cross-functionally with like engineering
12:15 teams as well as designers you know if
12:19 the you know product solution happens to
12:21 have an interface
12:23 um and we
12:25 really just go through a process of like
12:27 ideation so like a lot of like rough
12:29 prototypes like
12:30 you know here's this you know specific
12:32 goal that we're looking to meet like how
12:35 can we accomplish xyz how can we
12:37 accomplish a specific experience that
12:39 we're targeting
12:40 i mean from there we go through a couple
12:42 reps of like okay
12:44 how confident are we in the solution
12:47 okay how do we
12:49 and before you know and before that
12:52 point like we kind of like figure out
12:54 okay well how are we going to measure
12:55 the success of this
12:57 um so we generally have success metrics
13:00 in place to kind of like articulate okay
13:03 what is it you know that
13:05 we're trying to accomplish here how do
13:07 we measure that again sometimes it's
13:08 like an actual metric like oh we want to
13:10 see
13:11 xyz happen or sometimes it's like the
13:14 customer should be able to do this and
13:16 they should be able to do it effectively
13:18 um and from there you know we go through
13:21 the process of you know engineering it's
13:24 like okay we're gonna build this thing
13:25 we go through a few reps of demoing
13:28 along the way depending on like all
13:30 depending on the dependencies that are
13:32 needed for the specific feature
13:34 um development can take anywhere from
13:36 like you know
13:38 a few weeks to a month
13:40 and from there like you know we i go
13:43 through the process of product manager
13:44 of just like
13:46 if we run into any potential like
13:49 gotchas where we then have to reevaluate
13:52 how we're implementing the solution you
13:54 know coordinating with the team to make
13:55 sure we can get through those phases
13:57 um then it's the product launch process
14:00 where we were cross-functionally with
14:02 the go to market teams that's mark
14:04 product marketing
14:06 potentially other product stakeholders
14:10 design etc and we kind of generate all
14:12 the things that we need to do in order
14:14 to get the product to market and then we
14:17 go through the release process um
14:20 so yeah that's kind of like
14:22 yeah interesting so
14:24 product discovery phase then planning
14:26 phase then ideating and then starting
14:29 how to start interesting how you are
14:30 going to implement this thing and
14:32 setting up kpis then actually delivering
14:35 the thing with the engineering team and
14:37 then uh
14:39 thinking of launching after this thing
14:41 is the you know engineered created and
14:44 then actually releasing right did they
14:46 get it right and to you as a product
14:48 manager you need to think about all
14:50 these phases all these steps of the
14:52 process right
14:54 yep
14:55 and as a designer previously you were
14:57 mostly involved in the product discovery
14:59 phase or also other phrases as well
15:03 mostly the product discovery and then
15:04 the execution phase where we're ideating
15:07 and developing solutions
15:08 [Music]
15:10 i heard about this thing called design
15:11 thinking is it uh in the ideation phase
15:14 right like when you think okay here's
15:16 the problem and then you think how you
15:18 can solve it
15:19 and
15:21 you as a product manager also need to
15:23 know this kind of things and use them or
15:26 uh i mean it really depends on the
15:29 product manager um
15:31 some rely on the partnership with the
15:33 product designer to like guide through
15:35 that process some actually have a really
15:37 you know keen sensibility for it and so
15:40 i think it really depends on you know
15:43 what the
15:44 background and expertise of the product
15:46 manager is but it's generally not the
15:48 expectation i mean they should have an
15:51 understanding of whether or not the
15:52 experience actually delivers
15:54 you know on the you know goals that
15:56 they've set
15:57 um or the requirements that they've set
15:59 but it's
16:01 it's not always a requirement
16:03 but from what i understood
16:05 having
16:06 experience in product design is
16:09 definitely helpful
16:11 for transitioning into product
16:13 management role right
16:14 because there is some overlap like
16:16 especially this product discovery phase
16:18 and other things okay
16:20 and um how did you become interested in
16:23 product management
16:25 i mean i've always been super fascinated
16:28 with how companies work and more
16:30 importantly you know how they go about
16:32 building products so
16:34 i've always preferred to work in super
16:36 close partnership with product managers
16:38 as a designer
16:40 and
16:41 i always found that i was never
16:42 satisfied just fulfilling my own part
16:45 um so in particular
16:47 i was super interested in working
16:49 cross-functionally alongside our
16:51 engineering teams understanding the
16:53 system's driving behind driving whatever
16:56 we were designing and building
16:58 as well as the process of you know
17:00 measuring success of a feature product
17:02 like it wasn't just enough that we
17:03 launched something it was like okay
17:05 well how
17:06 how successful was this product released
17:09 like our customers like getting
17:12 our customers able to get what they need
17:14 to do done are they able to
17:17 you know achieve
17:18 like whatever
17:20 you know whatever the product is meant
17:22 for them to do
17:23 um
17:24 and then
17:25 if not like
17:27 what are what are some areas of
17:29 measurement that we can start you know i
17:31 dating on like oh
17:32 you know we realized in this
17:35 and this is a very simplified example
17:37 but like if we take like a generic
17:39 funnel like oh people dropped off at
17:41 this point in the user experience it's
17:42 like okay well why
17:44 and so then you can then generate a
17:46 series of hypotheses you can go back to
17:47 customers you can talk with them and
17:49 kind of develop an understanding and
17:51 enhance that feature down the road
17:54 okay and uh so you thought okay you want
17:57 to
17:58 uh
17:59 you know have maybe a larger scope right
18:02 and then have uh work in
18:04 cross-functional teams
18:06 and
18:06 so you and how like for you it was clear
18:10 that you need to go this road so you
18:12 need to go into the product management
18:16 role
18:17 or like how did you realize that this is
18:19 actually what you need because you
18:21 already had experience working with
18:22 product managers right
18:24 yeah so it's actually interesting a few
18:26 companies back i was really pushing the
18:29 team the product team to like
18:32 uh conduct experiments i was like
18:34 experiments are super easy like i earned
18:37 that experience when i was at a b2c
18:38 company we had a rigorous like ruth
18:41 um growth strategy and so like that's
18:43 where i like entered into like ooh
18:46 what's a b testing ooh it's like
18:49 how do we how can we effectively use
18:50 data to drive our business decisions and
18:52 so
18:54 you know a few companies ago i was like
18:55 really pressuring the product team like
18:57 hey like
18:58 maybe we can test this hypothesis out as
19:01 an experiment like what kind of data do
19:03 we have at our disposal like how can we
19:05 measure this
19:06 um and i remember the vp of product at
19:08 the time she approached me and she's
19:10 like i've never heard a designer
19:12 advocating for data like ever
19:15 she's like i i would be interested in
19:17 talking more i think you would be a
19:19 great pm like we should talk about it i
19:22 didn't make the transition back then
19:24 but
19:26 it ended up working out i ended up
19:27 making the transition further down the
19:28 road but
19:30 um
19:31 so yeah that's kind of like
19:33 what kind of led me into it
19:35 um
19:38 why data pm specifically or just
19:40 happened
19:44 i mean there is a reason
19:46 uh throughout my career and product
19:49 i spend a lot of time talking to various
19:52 people in different fields industries
19:54 roles from different backgrounds
19:56 and i often ask the question like how do
19:59 you go about making decisions
20:02 and
20:03 every answer is a little bit different
20:05 but one thing that they all have in
20:06 common is data
20:09 every single one
20:10 the problem i've found is that you know
20:13 most people who work outside of data
20:15 teams they generally don't have access
20:18 to know how
20:19 or the know-how to leverage that data um
20:23 oftentimes they're struggling to meet
20:25 their objectives while not having
20:26 effective ways to measure the success of
20:28 their projects and so
20:30 you know that then leads to a multitude
20:32 of problems down the road
20:34 either they're working on the wrong
20:35 thing or
20:37 you know maybe they're under delivering
20:38 on something that they should be
20:39 focusing on
20:41 a little bit more
20:43 so i wanted to learn a lot more around
20:45 how data teams operate
20:47 and how they can take oftentimes
20:49 abstract requirements from all over the
20:51 business
20:52 synthesize that data and make it
20:53 actionable like to me that was super
20:55 interesting
20:56 um especially like the last company i
20:58 worked for was a data it was an hr data
21:01 platform
21:02 a lot of hr professionals are working
21:04 with massive amounts of you know pii
21:07 and so like understanding the compliance
21:09 implications around that like how do you
21:11 store that data how do you make sure
21:13 that
21:14 you know it's secure how do you make
21:16 sure that the data that you're receiving
21:18 in your hrs tool
21:19 is correct
21:21 you know because a lot of times there's
21:22 a lot of various different sources of
21:24 data that are coming in and you have to
21:26 rely on
21:28 you know humans is part of that data
21:30 entry and so like how do you ensure how
21:32 do you like make sure that the data that
21:33 you're receiving that you're using to
21:35 inter interface with
21:37 your employees is correct
21:39 um
21:40 that was kind of like
21:42 that kind of like led me into my
21:44 interest in data
21:46 maybe it's a gross over simplification
21:48 but uh from what i understood the data
21:50 product manager is a product manager
21:53 working with data teams or in
21:55 like being inside a data team right yes
21:59 this is uh correct right
22:01 yes
22:02 is there any are there any other
22:04 differences between like let's say a
22:06 more traditional product manager and
22:09 data product manager apart from things
22:11 that you mentioned that you need to know
22:14 what pii stands for and
22:16 you know think about data quality and
22:18 other things
22:20 um
22:24 i'm relatively like early in my career
22:26 so i'm still figuring that out i also
22:28 feel like there are a couple different
22:29 interpretations that i've read about as
22:31 to what a data pm is
22:33 um
22:35 i've heard some people say like it's
22:36 part you know
22:38 uh
22:39 data analysis like you are also an
22:41 analyst as part of your role
22:43 um
22:44 i've heard that sometimes you're
22:46 oftentimes a data scientist as well
22:49 so
22:50 to answer that question like i'm not
22:52 sure how to answer it honestly i'm still
22:55 in the initial phase of like learning
22:57 how to be a data pm
23:00 you said you need to be a bit of a data
23:03 on a list uh so do you need to know
23:05 things like sql and to being able to
23:07 fetch go fetch the data you need and i
23:10 don't know build some dashboards or you
23:11 still rely on somebody else to do that
23:14 uh i guess it really depends on the
23:16 makeup of your team but i would say that
23:17 it would be a pretty hard requirement
23:20 like you need to know how to get the
23:21 data and to like check the work and make
23:23 sure that you know whatever output
23:26 you're getting is you know what you
23:28 expected
23:29 um so i did quite a bit of you know
23:32 learning i learned sql um
23:35 i learned
23:36 you know i took a few courses in data
23:39 engineering like i took some data camp
23:41 courses to kind of like understand like
23:43 some of the fundamentals
23:45 um so i think all of that is super
23:48 important to develop you know an
23:50 understanding and build some context
23:52 around the tools that you're building
23:55 so
23:56 sql and then also a bit of coding i
23:58 guess like if you said you were taking
24:00 some courses about data engineering so
24:03 you also
24:04 now for that probably need to know like
24:06 some python or something else right
24:10 i have not learned python yet
24:12 but so you were just watching these
24:13 courses to understand uh what are the
24:16 problems that data engineers have to
24:17 deal with yes
24:19 see and that's that's interesting but
24:22 sql would be something that you use
24:24 quite often right
24:26 yeah
24:26 okay
24:29 and we have a question from virginia
24:31 what skills should you have to become a
24:34 data product manager so you mentioned
24:36 one of them is sql what are the other
24:39 skills i guess maybe the skills of the
24:41 usual pm as well
24:43 or yeah i mean
24:45 i would say that you should
24:47 have a an insatiable hunger to
24:50 understand how data works
24:52 um
24:54 and you're interested in solving
24:56 data problems for your customers
24:59 not just you know the data engineers
25:01 themselves that you know are building
25:02 the tools but also
25:04 um
25:05 those who are most impacted by that data
25:08 so people like consumers within the
25:11 business internal or external um who
25:14 might be making decisions
25:16 um but you're also addicted to the idea
25:18 of like innovating and taking
25:20 data further um and what i mean by that
25:22 is like when i entered this role like i
25:26 had a very i would say rudimentary
25:28 understanding of data
25:30 um but one of the things that you know
25:32 the founders of my company said is like
25:34 that's actually a good thing like we we
25:36 need a fresh perspective on like
25:38 you know we want you to go through the
25:40 pain go through like like listening and
25:43 hearing about like stories of what data
25:44 engineering teams are going through what
25:46 data professionals are going through
25:48 come in with a fresh eye go through the
25:50 experience use your ux background to
25:52 kind of like
25:53 pull apart all the things that you know
25:55 are working and aren't working
25:57 um
25:59 so i would say like i i don't
26:00 necessarily think you need to have a
26:02 background in data
26:03 um you just want you just need to have
26:05 like an interest and a curiosity in it
26:13 technical background does help i mean a
26:15 lot of what i do is read documentation
26:18 which is
26:20 uh sad to say
26:21 very painful to read through
26:25 specifically around
26:27 you know
26:28 data tooling it's really hard
26:32 okay yeah you mentioned that you need to
26:34 have some
26:36 did you say we have hunger for
26:37 understanding how data works i think
26:39 that you said something like this so how
26:42 can you develop understanding uh of that
26:44 how can you understand how data works
26:47 like in what sense how data works
26:50 like how it is uh you know produced and
26:53 uh you know protest and consumed
26:58 i mean i think it starts from
27:01 you know just understanding where it
27:03 comes from
27:04 to start um
27:07 understanding
27:09 how a culmination of all the working
27:11 parts so like i feel like the
27:13 interesting about data um
27:15 is that it's not just one piece of data
27:17 that informs you know an answer to a
27:19 question it's usually a combination of
27:21 various points of data that can
27:23 ultimately answer a question well
27:25 and so
27:26 um
27:28 i would say that
27:30 having like an interest in understanding
27:32 what that actually means is like where
27:35 you begin this journey
27:37 and from there you can go into the
27:39 process of like understanding like how
27:42 that data
27:43 is
27:44 you know
27:45 pulled from various different sources
27:48 how it's prepared through transformation
27:51 um
27:52 and then
27:53 prepared for you know either a data
27:55 warehouse where an analyst can take that
27:58 and run with it or maybe the data like
28:00 where you're logging or whatever
28:03 or maybe it's being directly plugged
28:05 into a data application and so like
28:07 going through that journey of
28:08 understanding how it's used not just in
28:11 the data i feel like everyone just
28:12 thinks that data is used for data
28:14 analysis but there's so many other
28:15 applications and use cases
28:17 starting to dig in on you know all the
28:20 different ways that data can be
28:21 leveraged as part of a business but it
28:23 really is the underlying layer
28:25 of every company
28:27 um
28:29 okay so basically understanding that is
28:31 uh and uh and being curious how it's
28:34 actually used how it's produced is uh
28:37 um
28:38 you say it's quite important right for
28:40 this role
28:42 okay and uh yeah i'm
28:44 quite interested um let's say if we go
28:46 back uh like when did you make the
28:48 switch maybe one year ago like one year
28:50 ago i guess you became interested in
28:52 this topic right uh or i don't know
28:55 let's say let's go back in time when you
28:58 became interested and you know you
29:00 realize
29:01 this is what i want to do and what
29:04 you
29:04 did what did you do after that so what
29:07 were the steps you took to actually end
29:09 up in this role
29:12 so
29:16 i guess i should start that like i kind
29:18 of made my point of entry as a product
29:20 designer so i wanted to
29:22 you know
29:23 design and develop tooling around data
29:27 so i could better understand it
29:33 and part of that journey was really
29:37 like getting into the motion of
29:38 developing you know data tools um
29:41 designing and developing data tools and
29:43 learning from a lot of the engineering
29:45 teams that i was collaborating with
29:48 um
29:50 it kind of happened
29:53 and i feel like this kind of happens a
29:54 lot in my life so i don't know if this
29:56 is directly applicable to other people's
29:58 you know experiences but like
30:01 i happen to be oddly connected with a
30:03 lot of people in the data space
30:06 and i don't know if it's because of like
30:07 the types of companies that i've worked
30:09 for um but really just like having
30:11 conversations with them
30:13 talking about you know some of the
30:15 problems that you know at the time like
30:17 hr professionals or companies that were
30:19 hiring and leveraging background check
30:21 data for like how they were making
30:23 decisions and like how does this work
30:25 and like how do you
30:26 do your job and like blah blah blah and
30:28 just like kind of getting into
30:30 you know some of the more tactical
30:32 aspects of their work which like i mean
30:34 i think at the time i had like a very
30:35 granular understanding
30:37 um
30:39 and from there like it really was just
30:41 about
30:42 you know
30:43 networking with various like people
30:46 um
30:48 how i got into this specific company
30:50 where i'm actually you know designing
30:52 and developing you know
30:54 data tools directly like roxa
30:57 um
30:58 i actually had worked with the ceo at a
31:00 prior company uh we actually worked on
31:02 data tools at zendesk
31:04 not data tools developer tools at
31:06 zendesk
31:08 um
31:09 so he and i had already had like a
31:10 familiarity working with one another and
31:12 he's like hey like
31:13 i'm working on this new application
31:17 there's going to be a marketplace all
31:19 these things he's like let's do this so
31:21 it kind of just happened like i didn't i
31:24 didn't really have a process of steps
31:26 that i took so
31:27 i mean i wish i did but
31:29 i mean really it was just about putting
31:31 myself out there having conversations
31:33 talking with people and showing that
31:35 interest which kind of led to
31:38 me making the transition
31:40 okay so mostly networking them i'm also
31:42 curious about the did you take any
31:44 specific courses that help you or you
31:47 were taking courses after you actually
31:49 made the transition
31:51 because you mentioned you you took some
31:53 courses like you took the you trained
31:55 yourself
31:56 like you learned sql then it also took
31:59 data engineering course were you doing
32:00 this before actually becoming data
32:02 product manager or after no it was
32:05 actually after and if i could have done
32:08 one thing differently about this
32:09 transition i would have done this much
32:13 okay that's uh
32:15 so
32:16 basically you first became a daily
32:18 product manager and then learned all the
32:20 things so you didn't uh
32:22 study specifically for this role to
32:25 become an ideal
32:26 product
32:28 that's amazing but let's say if somebody
32:30 wants to
32:31 to do this right now
32:33 of course they can like how do you say
32:36 it fake it till you make it right
32:38 but
32:39 like let's say if somebody comes to you
32:41 and says hey i want to become a data
32:42 product manager i am now a product
32:44 designer
32:46 what kind of things would you recommend
32:48 me to learn now to be able to make this
32:52 transition
32:59 i think i always start by asking the
33:01 question like well why why a data
33:03 product manager
33:04 um
33:11 everyone understand like some of the
33:12 motivations as to why they want to do
33:15 that from product design um a lot of
33:18 that can help inform like okay what is
33:20 their decision making here
33:22 um they're already like inclined to data
33:24 then it's just kind of like yeah you
33:26 should you should
33:27 make the jump um
33:29 here are some things that i think you
33:31 can do so like building case studies
33:33 around like data projects that they've
33:35 worked on
33:36 um going through the process of you know
33:39 actually working designing developing
33:41 solutioning around a data product is
33:44 would be immensely helpful and from
33:46 there like whether or not you know they
33:48 were working with a product manager
33:50 or maybe they were flying solo who knows
33:52 depends on the makeup of the team like
33:54 if they can build you know case studies
33:56 around you know
33:58 the products that they've built like i
34:00 think that could go a long way in
34:01 demonstrating their ability
34:03 um
34:05 and that's something that they can take
34:06 with them
34:07 when they you know either make a
34:10 transition in their career within a
34:11 company
34:12 or even if they decide i'm gonna i'm
34:15 gonna go for it i'm gonna start applying
34:17 for you know potential positions in
34:19 product management i would say that like
34:22 a lot of my friends in general product
34:25 management have said i'm crazy for
34:27 jumping straight into not only like data
34:30 but like also transition product
34:31 management at the same time like it's
34:33 hard
34:34 it's challenging i feel like i'm
34:35 learning a lot of things all at once and
34:37 i've
34:38 fortunately had the you know
34:40 privilege to
34:42 you know have a lot of great people in
34:44 my network that have helped me
34:47 develop an understanding and get there
34:49 um
34:51 yeah really leveraging the people in
34:52 your network that are you know already
34:54 in the space to kind of understand like
34:57 you know okay
34:59 i'm curious what you think about my my
35:00 case study like can we talk about this
35:03 like
35:04 tell me more about like maybe the things
35:06 that i'm not understanding about what
35:07 i've worked on um learning some of like
35:10 the fundamental skills like around sql
35:12 if you want to learn python you can
35:14 build data apps if you want to
35:16 um i feel like there's pretty simple
35:18 ways of
35:19 you know showing
35:21 that ability through
35:23 like using public data sets you know
35:26 that are available broadly out there you
35:28 can
35:29 you know build case studies off of those
35:31 you don't have to necessarily use like
35:34 existing work either
35:35 um so if you want to you know build an
35:38 application
35:39 you know that surfaces covet 19 data and
35:42 like you can build something around that
35:44 like i think that could go a long way in
35:46 helping you
35:47 you know move into the direction of data
35:50 product management and what's a case
35:52 study so you said you should have case
35:55 studies around data projects so how does
35:57 a case study look like
35:59 so case study really goes into like
36:02 um the problem that you're trying to
36:04 solve so usually there's like a central
36:06 problem like we're trying to make
36:09 covid19 data more accessible to you know
36:12 people in this demographic
36:14 and so then you can go through the
36:15 process of like all the research that
36:18 you went through like the data that you
36:19 have and kind of like it's very similar
36:21 to what a product manager does when they
36:24 build the one pager to kind of explain
36:25 the why behind what they're doing
36:28 um you can then go into the process of
36:30 like and here are some ways here's some
36:32 opportunities i identified here are some
36:34 prototypes i did the user it's basically
36:37 going full end to end process of like
36:39 developing a data product
36:42 um
36:43 so
36:44 not only just
36:46 you know saying like and here was a
36:48 solution you can also go back and say
36:49 like
36:50 you know and i went back to customers or
36:52 i went back to you know people and asked
36:55 them like hey like what do you think
36:57 could have been better like did you use
36:59 a tool you know asking questions
37:00 understand like the utility of it and
37:03 whether or not it actually achieved the
37:05 outcomes you were expecting
37:07 um and usually there's like a conclusion
37:10 on like
37:11 you know this was a very successful
37:13 product or maybe this wasn't as
37:14 successful as i thought and here are
37:16 ways that i would you know potentially
37:18 improve on this feature
37:19 or this product
37:21 interesting so basically um if i go to
37:24 you correctly so the case style should
37:26 contain a problem then describe the
37:28 research you did the outcome of this
37:30 research they identified opportunities
37:32 then the solution
37:34 that you came
37:36 with after you know doing this research
37:38 then um you probably do some a few
37:40 iterations on that and then there is a
37:43 final outcome and you some conclusion
37:45 like was it successful project or not i
37:48 think
37:49 how
37:50 would you put this like as a
37:53 document like with a couple of pages
37:56 right
37:57 there's a couple different formats you
37:59 can go with um
38:01 i've seen some people just like put it
38:03 on their personal websites uh that's
38:06 like the best ways
38:08 yeah like a blog post you know some
38:10 people actually do use like medium
38:13 um as a way to kind of like
38:15 present case studies
38:17 um personal websites if you're directly
38:20 applying and you're like sharing with a
38:22 specific group of people you can use a
38:24 pdf like i've seen case studies packaged
38:27 in a number of different ways like
38:29 slides it really just depends on yeah
38:31 slide decks work too it really depends
38:33 on who your audience is like
38:35 i find that
38:38 i love when i when i go to someone's
38:40 website and i see
38:41 you know a list of case studies that
38:43 they've worked on and i'm like oh cool
38:44 what have they been working on um and i
38:47 think that's a great way to
38:49 get discovered as opposed to like having
38:51 to go to the process of specifically
38:54 applying and sending out your case
38:56 studies to individuals like put it
38:57 somewhere public where people can find
38:59 it and that can generate a multitude of
39:02 opportunities for you
39:03 okay so you mentioned multiple times
39:06 that networking is uh like a big deal
39:09 right because you
39:10 because of your network you are managed
39:12 to you you managed to get a lot of
39:14 opportunities right and including this
39:16 one the the job you have right now
39:18 because it was your former colleague
39:20 right from some of your previous jobs
39:23 then uh it's important also to be how to
39:26 say discoverable so people can discover
39:29 you through blog posts and other things
39:32 uh and this is how like you prepare this
39:35 case studies so you put them out there
39:37 and people can find you through these
39:39 case studies
39:41 and
39:42 also you said well we talked about these
39:45 different phases of a
39:47 project or product right so this is
39:49 something as a you should also know as a
39:51 data product manager right so this is
39:54 i guess some some product management
39:56 skills that you need right for this job
39:59 do you know any good resource for where
40:01 you can pick up these skills
40:04 or product management yeah for product
40:06 management
40:08 i feel like there's a ton of like
40:14 there's a ton of like different
40:16 i guess courses
40:18 um out there i can send a list um that
40:21 i've collected over the years to you and
40:24 you can include that
40:25 um
40:28 i haven't gone through a specific boot
40:30 camp most of my learning has been on the
40:32 job so i can't
40:34 recommend one through direct experience
40:38 one program actually no that's that's
40:40 incorrect
40:42 i went through the reforged product
40:44 management fundamentals course which is
40:46 great
40:48 they kind of go through all the various
40:51 stages of you know product development
40:54 for a product manager
40:56 um
40:57 you get to talk with and interact with a
40:59 bunch of
41:00 you know product leaders and various
41:03 different you know
41:05 industries to learn more about their
41:07 experiences and a lot of those are
41:09 directly applicable to the work that
41:10 you'll be doing
41:12 um there's also a range of various
41:14 exercises that you also do it's
41:17 it's quite a commitment but i think if
41:19 you want to get a get
41:23 basically get a
41:25 solid
41:26 um how do you say it
41:32 if you want to get your feet wet and you
41:34 know
41:35 dive into all the motions of product
41:38 management the thing with product
41:40 management is it's not like just like
41:41 one set linear process to everything it
41:45 really just it really depends on the
41:46 products that you're working on the team
41:48 structure etc
41:50 so
41:51 understanding and having the foundations
41:53 and knowing what you can add to your
41:54 tool set as a product manager is super
41:56 powerful
41:58 so taking a course like the one at
42:00 reforge is really good so you can kind
42:02 of like build that tool set ask
42:04 questions understand the context behind
42:06 it by talking to like industry leaders
42:09 and then
42:10 know when it's directly applicable to
42:12 the work that you're doing so then you
42:14 know you can make the best decisions for
42:17 your team
42:18 yeah thanks so i i was thinking
42:21 something like a course plan or study
42:23 plan for somebody who wants to
42:24 transition to this role so first of all
42:28 you should take some sort of a general
42:30 product management uh course or
42:33 pick up this skill somewhere maybe
42:36 through
42:36 not necessarily for courses but somehow
42:38 pick this
42:39 then you mention sql
42:42 and other data related things
42:44 um
42:45 right and then you should also prepare
42:48 your portfolio make a couple of case
42:50 studies put them on medium and uh
42:54 yeah that's that should be sufficient or
42:57 there's something else that i'm missing
43:00 a network of course right
43:02 yeah
43:03 i would say really put yourself out
43:04 there and talk with product managers
43:06 that work in the space extensively
43:10 that's one thing that i also would have
43:12 done a bit differently it's just hard to
43:13 find data product managers
43:16 um
43:17 they're relatively rare and
43:18 understanding like
43:20 you know
43:21 i'm obviously learning from like
43:24 my vp of product has been working in
43:26 data for a decade
43:29 he used to be a data engineer and is now
43:31 a product leader in data and so a lot of
43:34 my learning also comes from him as well
43:37 as he coaches me and like guides me
43:39 through that process
43:40 i think one other thing that would be
43:43 super useful for
43:44 individuals who want to
43:46 become data product manager or product
43:48 managers in general is to find someone
43:51 who can mentor you or guide you through
43:53 this learning process
43:55 um
43:56 i would say
43:58 finding data product managers while it
44:00 is relatively
44:03 hard to find them like you can
44:05 you can find them if you look at like oh
44:07 who like look at all the you know data
44:10 companies out there and
44:11 see who is working in product at those
44:13 companies you can generally find someone
44:16 um
44:17 but definitely find a mentor that can
44:19 kind of like help guide you through that
44:20 process as well okay thanks
44:23 um
44:24 yeah we have quite a few questions and
44:26 uh
44:27 i wanted to start with a question from
44:29 janine
44:30 is the question is what's the most
44:32 challenging aspect or task that you've
44:34 encountered in your role as a data
44:37 product manager
44:41 for me it's really been
44:48 learning how to interact with the tools
44:51 i'm not an engineer i'm a designer i can
44:54 do a little bit of coding but like
44:56 getting through the documentation
44:59 of some of the data tooling out there i
45:01 think i mentioned it earlier it's really
45:02 hard and a lot of that comes from at
45:05 least in my experience understanding all
45:07 the dependencies and other
45:09 various tooling that like comes into
45:11 play like
45:12 you know spin up you know service with
45:14 docker and like do all these things and
45:16 i'm just like okay now i need to figure
45:18 out how to do this
45:19 so it's like
45:21 there's like a you know lead up to you
45:23 know getting a specific outcome and it's
45:26 not always
45:28 uh apparent
45:30 when you're
45:31 you know reading up on how to use a
45:33 specific tool
45:35 especially when these talks are written
45:36 by engineers right
45:39 yeah and
45:40 they kind of assume that people who eat
45:42 these dogs they have the same background
45:43 so they
45:44 understand um easily what they mean but
45:47 uh if you're uh like a product manager
45:50 maybe you don't necessarily have this
45:52 the same background as they right
45:54 yeah that was the most uh challenging
45:57 aspect right
45:59 or me yeah
46:01 then uh a question from virginia
46:04 is how does your day today look like
46:10 day to day is kind of all over the place
46:12 um obviously we have you know
46:15 the
46:16 first of the day stand up with the team
46:18 and that's really just to figure out
46:20 what
46:21 you know engineering is working on what
46:23 design is working on what product is
46:24 working on
46:25 a lot of my time is spent you know
46:29 figuring out the why behind some of the
46:30 things that we're
46:32 you know planning
46:34 um so
46:35 whether that's a new connector or maybe
46:38 a new feature set around transformations
46:40 like
46:41 figuring out okay you know again what
46:43 problem are we trying to solve and going
46:45 through that process that i talked about
46:46 before
46:48 um but there's a lot of other things
46:49 that kind of happen in between as part
46:51 of the day so it's not just like doing
46:53 the work of like product development
46:55 it's also working cross-functionally
46:57 with other teams so i work pretty
46:59 heavily with our marketing team
47:01 so i do a lot of like
47:04 quick and dirty data analysis for
47:06 analysis for them so they can get answer
47:08 questions about our customers so
47:10 i'm directly querying our
47:12 our platform api database to kind of
47:14 understand like here you know
47:17 here's a list of customers that fit
47:19 these attributes for you so it's like
47:21 doing a lot of that at the same time we
47:22 are also very early stage i should
47:25 mention that we're not a big company and
47:27 so like
47:28 you know part of my job is also
47:29 fulfilling other areas i'm also in you
47:32 know design reviews
47:34 um sometimes it's related to projects
47:37 that i'm on sometimes that's not
47:38 offering design critique um
47:41 [Music]
47:42 that's more development conversation so
47:45 like
47:45 one part of our job even if it's not
47:47 directly tied to a project is just
47:49 getting out there and talking with data
47:50 professionals
47:52 so reaching out you know
47:54 every day to either people who have
47:56 signed up on our platform
47:58 or you know various data professionals
48:01 within my internal network or external
48:03 of that getting time on the phone to
48:05 talk with them and learn more about you
48:07 know
48:08 their experiences
48:10 um
48:12 also
48:13 instrumenting at least right now
48:16 i've been instrumenting product
48:18 analytics tracking so
48:20 figuring out you know how do we
48:23 best utilize our analytics tracking tool
48:26 to
48:27 measure user behavior in our application
48:30 so doing a lot of like side projects
48:32 like that that kind of like reinforce
48:33 the work that we do also
48:39 i think i covered all of it there's a
48:40 lot there's a lot that goes into the
48:42 day-to-day and it's not always the same
48:44 are you always multitasking or you're
48:46 trying to arrange your day in a way that
48:49 you don't have to switch context
48:52 ah there's a lot of context switching
48:53 and product management that's kind of
48:55 the name of the game
48:56 it's just like prioritizing what you do
48:59 in your day-to-day so obviously someone
49:01 can come to you and say like hey i need
49:02 an answer to this question
49:04 um
49:05 it's up to you to really decide okay
49:07 well how urgent is this and like what is
49:09 this for you can kind of determine
49:11 throughout your day like when you do
49:12 that work because there's definitely
49:14 work that comes up in the middle of the
49:15 day that i'm like oh this can be kicked
49:17 off till next week okay
49:19 let's talk next week i'll have the
49:20 answers for you then um so it's really
49:23 just like prioritizing your day and
49:25 understanding like what are the key
49:26 things that i need to get done
49:28 especially at early stage like
49:32 you know you have to you have to use
49:34 your time wisely
49:36 and you mentioned that you spend a lot
49:38 of time talking to data professionals
49:40 getting on the phone with them asking
49:42 questions
49:43 and i'm wondering how
49:45 do this conversation look like so
49:48 what do you ask uh
49:50 like it's called customer custodial
49:52 right customer development yes so
49:55 how does it look like what do you ask
49:58 i mean customer develop can range
50:00 depending on who i'm talking to so like
50:01 i'm not just talking to data engineers
50:03 i'm also talking to data scientists data
50:05 analysts um
50:07 data analyst engineers
50:09 and a lot of what i talk about is just
50:11 like understanding like what their core
50:13 responsibilities are
50:15 um
50:17 and you know depending on that answer
50:20 like sometimes they'll go into like okay
50:22 what specific problems are you trying to
50:23 solve in this
50:24 area um
50:26 what challenges are you running into so
50:28 really getting into some of the tactical
50:29 aspects of like the tooling that they
50:31 use or maybe some of the organizational
50:33 problems that they have where
50:35 you know it's not just the tooling it's
50:37 also you know
50:38 maybe the company isn't data driven
50:40 maybe aren't they aren't given the
50:41 resources that they need and how they
50:43 kind of get around that in order to do
50:45 their job
50:47 um
50:48 and so a lot of the um conversations in
50:52 general are more geared towards like
50:54 it's kind of like a flowing thing
50:56 there's like no rigid you know structure
50:59 but i do like to hit the points of like
51:02 what are your responsibilities like
51:05 where
51:06 where are you currently focusing your
51:08 time and kind of like digging into some
51:10 of the challenges specifically to
51:12 understand
51:13 like
51:14 what could be better
51:16 in your day today and like how how do
51:18 you accomplish that today are you or are
51:21 you not
51:22 and if somebody wants to talk to you
51:24 about that how can they reach out to you
51:29 uh
51:30 you can send me a message in the data
51:33 talks
51:34 slack um or
51:37 or you know i can share my
51:40 email address and i'd be happy happy to
51:42 chat with anyone okay but you said if
51:45 they leave their email on
51:48 your
51:49 website right then you will find this
51:51 email and contact them
51:53 okay
51:56 did you what was the most interesting
51:58 part uh what was the most interesting
52:00 let's say insight you got from this
52:02 conversations
52:11 i guess the most surprising thing is
52:15 trying to think of how to phrase this
52:19 um
52:27 it was interesting to see and maybe i
52:29 wasn't too terribly surprised but it was
52:31 surprising all the same
52:33 through the discussions is that a lot of
52:37 data teams spend a lot of time educating
52:40 their
52:42 educating
52:44 various like this like cross um
52:47 functional teams on like how to leverage
52:49 data
52:50 um
52:53 i feel like
52:54 in a lot of discussions that i've had
52:56 specifically with data engineers they
52:58 kind of operate in isolation at a lot of
53:00 companies
53:01 i'm starting to see that a lot of teams
53:03 are kind of like
53:06 you know
53:07 integrating
53:08 data into their product teams
53:11 but for a really long time or like from
53:14 what i've seen like a lot of data teams
53:16 are like in service of like product and
53:18 service of marketing and service of you
53:20 know business intelligence
53:22 and so like
53:24 a lot of what they do there's like a lot
53:26 of context switching between like okay
53:27 now i need to like help this person
53:29 understand you know
53:30 the data that they're asking for and i
53:33 need to make sure that you know this
53:34 person has this it just it sounded like
53:37 there was just like a lot of
53:38 whack-a-mole
53:39 um in the role and i guess what was
53:42 interesting to me was that you know just
53:45 understanding largely even though
53:46 there's a lot of teams that heavily rely
53:48 on data how little
53:50 you know professionals in various fields
53:52 truly understand it
53:54 um and how much work goes into educating
53:57 those different business partners on how
53:59 to use it
54:00 um
54:02 i just found that super
54:04 surprising and unsurprising at the same
54:06 time i don't i don't know
54:08 yeah interesting um yeah we have quite a
54:12 few questions uh so one interesting one
54:15 is if you need to work with the two
54:17 and u2 for you that you have never used
54:19 before
54:21 how do you learn this tool
54:23 while not letting the task to be delayed
54:25 do you learn it yourself or you ask for
54:27 help or how do you approach that
54:30 um
54:31 generally i try to take a whack at it
54:33 first
54:34 um
54:35 and a lot of that is just like a lot of
54:36 documentation diving
54:39 stress testing like all the things that
54:40 i could possibly do or know how to do if
54:42 i run into a wall uh we have
54:45 quite a few
54:46 ten-year data engineers on my team i'll
54:49 usually reach out to someone and say
54:51 like hey i'm getting stuck here like can
54:53 you help me
54:54 um or i don't understand why it works
54:56 this way
54:57 um and so i rely a lot on my engineering
55:00 team to kind of help me understand the
55:02 goal here is eventually i can help
55:04 myself but um
55:06 for right now like as i
55:08 you know lack understanding in some of
55:09 these tools it's really just asking for
55:12 help from the engineering team
55:15 how do you usually do this you mentioned
55:17 this on a stand-up hey i got stuck here
55:20 somebody has free time can you help me
55:22 something like that
55:24 uh we have a help channel in our slack
55:26 so it's just like literally a help
55:28 channel and you can ask any question
55:30 like no question is a bad question
55:33 um and then we just make time to pair
55:36 for you know however long it takes
55:38 um
55:39 we get through the process together and
55:42 yeah
55:44 that's really ad hoc
55:45 yeah okay
55:47 do you yourself work on creating
55:49 documentation as well or you're more
55:52 like a consumer of documentation
55:55 i help with the framing and the
55:57 positioning of like how we word things
55:59 um but are
56:01 currently developer advocacy and
56:03 engineering work together to develop
56:05 that documentation
56:08 and
56:09 another question we have is do pms
56:11 document the product
56:13 and features and how do you do this
56:17 yeah let's say somebody new joints and
56:19 then they want to go through all this
56:21 you know product discovery things and so
56:23 on like uh how can they
56:26 learn this how do you document that
56:30 yeah so a lot of our work is documented
56:33 in product docs so one pagers prds
56:37 we also have
56:39 a database of customer development notes
56:42 so we articulate like
56:44 who did we talk to what was our role
56:47 what company do they work for
56:49 and then we kind of go into you know
56:51 what are their all the you know points
56:54 that i had explained before like their
56:55 responsibilities problems are ramming to
56:57 solve
56:59 because our product is you know
57:01 real-time data we talk a little bit
57:02 about cdc and the applications within
57:04 their current data stack if applicable
57:07 and so we'll kind of like lean in on
57:09 that a little bit
57:11 but we document everything everything is
57:13 recorded um for
57:16 note-taking purposes and then we go
57:18 through the process of like
57:20 cataloging that we also use it quite
57:22 frequently when we um so we have a
57:26 product
57:27 weekly update that we kind of like
57:29 communicate to the team what we're
57:30 working on and so we'll often draw
57:32 you know that information into what we
57:34 talk about on a weekly basis like this
57:36 is what we've we've been hearing from
57:38 customers if you want to look more into
57:40 those conversations you can find that
57:42 information here and so we're actually
57:44 pushing our team to like go into these
57:47 customer development notes and kind of
57:48 like build empathy
57:50 you know they might already be data
57:52 engineers or engineers that understand
57:54 the product but like it really helps to
57:56 bring them along in that process and
57:58 building empathy for the tools that
57:59 they're building
58:00 yeah and you mentioned prd
58:03 this product requirement document or
58:05 what is that yep
58:07 product requirement document yeah like i
58:10 got this right i was thinking what it
58:11 means i think i heard this abbreviation
58:14 before that's why i
58:16 yeah
58:17 um do you have a couple of more minutes
58:22 i do yeah we have more questions and um
58:24 i think maybe we can cover at least one
58:28 um so a question from byram is
58:30 how are the steps for working with uh
58:34 what are the steps for working with data
58:36 teams and who comes
58:38 with new ideas
58:39 who brings up the requirements
58:45 what are the steps for working with data
58:48 engineering teams
58:51 like where do the ideas come from is it
58:53 uh they either come from you are they
58:55 coming from the
58:57 customers are they coming from the
58:58 engineers are they coming from
59:00 everywhere
59:02 gotcha i mean it's a culmination of all
59:04 those things so obviously we have a we
59:06 have a company and business and product
59:08 strategy that we're kind of running
59:10 um
59:11 so
59:12 a lot of the
59:13 opportunities that we
59:15 go after are things that we've kind of
59:17 like prioritized like both like
59:20 engineering leadership product
59:21 leadership have kind of like defined for
59:23 the team
59:24 um and then you know someone like me
59:26 who's an individual contributor we take
59:28 that we then go through the motions of
59:30 like validating whether or not you know
59:32 it's the problem to be solved
59:34 uh do all the research and then come
59:36 back to the team and say like hey these
59:37 were my findings do you still think this
59:39 is worth going after
59:41 um so a lot of the idea generation
59:44 like is coming from you know leadership
59:47 uh engineering leadership at least right
59:49 now
59:50 um but that doesn't necessarily mean
59:52 that a future idea purely comes from
59:55 them because through our research and
59:57 building an understanding of problem
59:59 space
1:00:01 that might change how we approach a
1:00:04 feature or
1:00:06 like whatever we you know end up
1:00:08 releasing at the end of the day
1:00:10 so if the engineering leadership comes
1:00:12 up with an idea it doesn't mean you
1:00:15 immediately run implementing this it
1:00:18 first goes through the validation stage
1:00:20 and
1:00:21 then like you actually ask the customers
1:00:24 to get some feedback from them right so
1:00:26 that's that's the process exactly so you
1:00:28 have i guess some sort of backlog with
1:00:30 ideas and then you try to prioritize
1:00:32 that backlog and then you pick the most
1:00:34 promising ones and then you go through
1:00:36 this process
1:00:37 yep exactly
1:00:40 then maybe just a quick question that is
1:00:42 more like yes or no
1:00:44 question is reports dashboards machine
1:00:46 learning models that data team
1:00:48 provides
1:00:50 are they all
1:00:51 um under the responsibility of data
1:00:54 product manager or or not
1:01:00 sorry the
1:01:01 yeah so like what kind of
1:01:03 let's say let me try to rephrase it
1:01:05 so for you are you looking
1:01:08 only after um you know reports
1:01:11 dashboards and so on or also machine
1:01:14 learning models as well like do data
