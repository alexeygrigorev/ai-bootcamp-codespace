1:03 this
1:04 so this week we'll talk about changing
1:07 career from software engineering to data
1:11 science management and we have a special
1:12 guest today Sadat Sadat and I are
1:15 colleagues we both work at elix group he
1:17 joined to elix as a software engineer
1:19 then he got promoted to an engineering
1:21 manager and finally he decided to change
1:24 his career and switch to data science
1:26 management so I invited Sadat to talk
1:29 more about his career transition welcome
1:32 thank you very much super happy to be
1:34 here and and talk to the community
1:36 yeah happy to have you here too so
1:39 before we go into our main topic and
1:42 discuss your career transitioning in
1:44 details maybe we can briefly go over
1:47 your career Journey so far so how did it
1:50 start sure
1:52 here's a fun fact that I think now not a
1:55 lot of people know but I actually always
1:57 wanted to become a doctor an inspiration
1:59 that I had from my father so engineering
2:01 or maybe data science management was
2:04 really not something that became a
2:07 reality much later on in this journey
2:11 um I think yeah
2:12 adolescence uh teenagers is when I
2:15 realized that I'm super curious about
2:17 technology those things fascinated me it
2:19 turns out engineering is then a better
2:21 option
2:23 um I have a bachelor's in electronics
2:25 and then I have a masters in inform
2:28 informatic or information technology
2:30 from uh from a university in Germany in
2:34 Stuttgart in between my bachelor's and
2:36 Masters I worked for a brief period in
2:38 India around two and a half three years
2:42 um not to be honest the best part of my
2:44 career I wasn't doing something crazy
2:47 but I think my Master's changed a lot of
2:49 that during my Master's while I was a
2:52 student I was also working for the front
2:55 offer Institute which is a very famous
2:57 German Research Institute as a I'm not
3:01 really sure what it's called but it's a
3:02 heavy it's like a student job and you
3:04 work on different projects with people
3:06 writing their phds or or full-time
3:08 employees of the front offer Institute
3:09 research assistant I guess a research
3:13 assistant yeah probably I think it's
3:14 called or something that's the the
3:17 German word TV for short but yeah I
3:19 think research assistant
3:20 and this was fun I got that that's I
3:24 think where I got my proper exposure to
3:26 software engineering
3:28 um and also maybe my first introduction
3:31 to Vision there was a brief project that
3:33 I did with insurance companies uh where
3:36 the idea was to look at the car look at
3:38 the image of a car and identify a dents
3:41 in it
3:43 um opencv Good Old Days uh yeah and then
3:46 I moved to software I finished my
3:47 masters I moved to Berlin and ever since
3:49 I've been here I've worked for Alex is
3:51 now my fourth company in Berlin
3:55 um yeah started at rebuy delivery hero
3:58 this is a brief stint at Daimler the
4:01 company that owned Mercedes-Benz
4:03 and now OLX
4:05 for how long have you been with olix
4:08 it's almost three years now in in Feb
4:10 I'm going to be finishing my third year
4:12 at OLX I'm starting my fourth
4:14 what did you actually study
4:17 um in Bachelor so you said Electronics
4:19 but I have no idea what it actually
4:20 means
4:21 neither do I to be honest it's been a
4:23 long time did you learn to solder or no
4:25 so right it was a bachelor's it was an
4:28 engineering degree in electronics so I
4:29 had a lot of signal processing
4:32 um Hardware really that was the focus uh
4:35 semiconductor
4:37 compositions uh PCB design stuff like
4:41 that not a lot of computer science
4:43 actually I had two courses maybe related
4:45 to computer science and my bachelor's
4:47 but you learn to program there
4:49 uh no uh like I said during my masters
4:53 that that's when I uh yeah I guess I
4:57 properly learned the program uh during
4:59 my Master's I always had this curiosity
5:01 uh like I said so after my bachelor's I
5:04 did a job I did I worked for two and a
5:07 half years in India
5:08 um during this period I tried to learn
5:10 programming but I wasn't very good at it
5:13 also my job
5:14 was called a software engineer but I
5:17 wasn't engineering any software in those
5:20 days uh what did you do I was a
5:23 glorified accountant I would say I I
5:25 learned a lot of excel tricks like
5:28 I know a lot of excel shortcuts that
5:31 most Engineers probably don't
5:33 can you dupe your table
5:35 I can do pivot table I can do vlookups I
5:38 can do Edge lookups uh that's how you
5:42 started data science right so that's how
5:44 you so a lot of those things actually do
5:47 something like that's why I think it's
5:49 interesting no matter what you do it
5:51 might not seem interesting but if you're
5:53 learning something anything keep at it
5:55 you don't know when it'll become handy
5:58 some of the stuff that I learned back in
6:00 those days with with Excel I I do use
6:02 today as a manager I work a lot with
6:04 Excel now
6:06 do you work with something else as a
6:08 manager
6:10 um documentation I think that that would
6:12 be that is so the Google
6:14 G Suite right the that is my new IDE
6:18 that I have I've started noticing and
6:20 more often on that than I am on an IDE
6:22 okay so let's go three years back or two
6:26 and something so what did you do to
6:28 Elixir backend engineer
6:31 so I started OLX as a senior engineer
6:34 for the search team when I was hired at
6:36 OLX I was already in the field of search
6:39 search and recommendation for a while
6:41 now around three four years I guess
6:45 um so I started OLX as a search engineer
6:48 my first
6:49 tasks if I remember correctly so the day
6:53 I joined OLX my manager met me in the
6:56 kitchen so in in the lobby and he said
6:58 we are having an issue on solar right
7:00 now welcome but I'm gonna come back for
7:02 you later so this is my introduction I
7:05 landed
7:06 on this ship and there was already a
7:08 fire
7:10 um solar as a lot of people who've used
7:12 it can maybe understand like sometimes
7:14 you have a setup that isn't optimal and
7:16 it's always screaming and shouting and
7:18 burning what is solar for those who
7:20 don't know right sorry uh for those of
7:22 you who don't know solar is basically an
7:26 inverted index document store that is
7:29 basically powered on this this Library
7:35 called leucine which is the same library
7:37 that powers elasticsearch so if you
7:39 haven't heard of solar but you know what
7:41 elasticsearch is it's basically leucine
7:44 wrapped under a different uh kind of
7:47 like image very similar stuff and
7:50 universities index document store means
7:52 right search engine right sorry it's
7:55 exactly it's inverted index documents I
7:58 can go into a lot of details on how an
8:00 invert what an inverted index is how it
8:02 works but uh yeah tldr it's what search
8:06 is uh it's for power search for most
8:09 so you knew this before joining Alex
8:12 because he worked for a couple four
8:15 years already as a search engineer and
8:17 this is something you you knew how to
8:19 use I I knew I I had worked with uh I
8:22 have worked with uh solar quite a bit
8:24 I've also worked with elasticsearch I've
8:26 dabbled it with a few other uh Niche
8:29 Technologies and such let's say but yeah
8:31 I'm very familiar with how these uh
8:33 Technologies work so your first day
8:36 there is a fire solar is down your
8:39 manager is fixing that so what do you do
8:42 thankfully he did ask me to fix it
8:44 because that would have been pressure
8:45 right I know I enjoyed my coffee uh met
8:48 my new team uh life went on a week later
8:51 we were writing the postmortem for what
8:53 had happened and I don't remember the
8:55 details to be honest but it was always
8:58 something related to the auto scaler
9:01 that so for for those of you who worked
9:03 briefly with solar is an interesting
9:04 thing right so solar cloud is designed
9:08 to scale with load and our cluster was
9:11 configured to scale with load now
9:14 whenever a solar cluster scales out
9:16 which is like adds Newton nodes there is
9:18 a lot of CPU intensive tasks that need
9:20 to be done which is like copy the data
9:23 propagate it to this new node assemble
9:26 the node distribute traffic to this new
9:29 node a lot of stuff that is very CPU
9:31 intensive through that Ask A system that
9:34 is already under CPU load to do that and
9:36 you have what is a classical I don't
9:39 know Fireball of solar crashing because
9:41 solar wants to scale out it cannot even
9:45 do what it is doing and because it
9:47 cannot do what it is doing it wants to
9:49 scale out even more
9:51 um easiest fix is to stop that
9:53 configuration stop solar from Auto
9:56 scaling out works all of the time that's
9:58 what we also did eventually at OLX uh
10:01 fun fact our schedule our scaling is now
10:04 scheduled rather than automatic so we do
10:06 it at perceived intervals of time rather
10:09 than dynamically with traffic
10:12 so let's say during night it's two notes
10:15 during days four notes something like
10:18 that right something like that those
10:19 numbers are probably multiplied by a
10:21 huge number
10:23 so yeah somewhere around 15 maybe but
10:26 yeah okay so what did you do apart from
10:29 you know I don't know how much time you
10:31 spent
10:32 fighting fires but in general what kind
10:36 of tasks did you need to work so uh what
10:39 had happened when I landed uh at the
10:41 search team at OLX is also the start of
10:44 the pandemic or almost the start of the
10:45 pandemic we didn't know that yet there
10:47 was this new virus news coming in from
10:48 China
10:50 um a lot of uncertainty
10:53 um so we were doing we were putting out
10:54 a lot of fire there were some product
10:56 roadmap I don't exactly remember what
10:58 but two weeks into my job at OLX we
11:02 enter the German lockdowns I think other
11:05 countries had rolling lockdowns in
11:06 around that time but Germany had locked
11:08 down two weeks after I joined
11:10 um there was a lot of uncertainty
11:12 product uh so there was a focus from
11:15 management to to really work on only
11:18 essential stuff and and things that
11:20 would keep the business alive because
11:21 back then we didn't know how long this
11:22 would last what would be financial
11:23 implications and stuff like that so
11:26 basically a lot of our moonshot projects
11:29 are put on hold I had the time I needed
11:32 to look at the the landscape and
11:34 understand what our main problems were
11:37 and for what I had identified as or I'm
11:41 sorry
11:42 what I identified as our main problem
11:43 one of our main problems was the fact
11:46 that we were still very much coupled to
11:49 the big monolith
11:51 and this faced uh posed its own
11:54 challenges plus the configurations with
11:56 solar with our solar cluster were
11:58 sub-optimal
11:59 I created a proposal uh shared that with
12:02 my manager and my product manager uh to
12:06 decouple search
12:08 it was it was an interesting idea my my
12:11 ask to them was give me six months with
12:13 zero product feature development but
12:14 core engineering work and I will promise
12:17 to give you the fastest iterating
12:19 product at OLX
12:21 three years later I think we're at the
12:23 relevance team which is now my future
12:24 team is one of the fastest iterating
12:27 teams at OLX
12:29 last year I think we did over 100
12:31 experiments uh with new product features
12:35 so yeah management my my leaders
12:38 believed in me they gave me the
12:39 opportunity and
12:41 humbly I think I achieved a lot of what
12:44 I had promised there were some delays I
12:46 think it took us a little more than six
12:47 months uh but yeah we eventually got
12:50 there we decoupled search we improved
12:52 the configurations
12:54 uh we also have backups of on backups
12:57 upon backups now so
13:00 um I guess the last time we had a full
13:02 outage on search so probably been over a
13:04 year or two years
13:06 so maybe I'll try to summarize what you
13:08 said so
13:10 you and your team had a super large
13:12 service right that was doing everything
13:15 including search and search was a little
13:18 piece of this right and then making
13:20 changes to this little piece was very
13:22 difficult because it affected the rest
13:24 of the service too right and you
13:27 suggested you approached your management
13:29 and said okay let give me six months
13:31 I'll take this part out into a separate
13:34 service and I'll call this uh it will be
13:37 a microservice and it will be
13:39 responsible only for search
13:41 macro service is what I like to use
13:43 macro it's a little more than micro I
13:46 mean it is a very service it does a lot
13:47 of stuff but in essence yes we wanted to
13:50 carve out a bit of the the big OLX
13:53 monolith
13:54 and this helped us with a lot of stuff
13:56 right uh the the stack was newer
13:58 alerting monitoring where thought of
14:01 before the product development so it was
14:04 very natural uh to have alerting and
14:06 monitoring in place
14:08 um we we had a lot of experience running
14:12 the old system so we knew what systems
14:13 needed to be optimized or what parts of
14:15 the code needed to be optimized what
14:17 parts of the code
14:18 could be Rewritten in different ways
14:22 um yeah in essence that's what we did
14:25 and what did you use for that for
14:29 implementing this thing
14:30 the new service is and it is the service
14:33 that is currently live is written in
14:35 kotlin
14:36 uh there are a few other satellites
14:39 around the macro service which are
14:41 written in Python and kotlin depending
14:44 on what these services are so search
14:46 also at OLX consumes a lot of uh machine
14:50 learning products uh spell checker
14:53 uh Rancor all of that so we do have some
14:57 python services that are in the
14:59 ecosystem but the
15:00 chunk is
15:03 so what was your exposure to all this
15:05 machine learning and data science
15:08 um I guess before oil X or at OLX how
15:11 much of this stuff did you already know
15:13 so
15:14 um the first my first exposure to
15:17 machine learning artificial intelligence
15:20 uh was during my Master's thesis my the
15:24 thesis that I published was uh basically
15:27 to propose an algorithm that was
15:30 basically using a neural network to
15:33 predict the energy consumptions at the
15:36 Stuttgart airport it was in
15:38 collaboration with the company that is
15:39 responsible for maintaining and running
15:41 the Stuttgart Airport
15:43 and so that was my first exposure that's
15:45 when I really got into the details of
15:47 what neural networks are how they
15:49 function I I built my first network
15:52 transfer learning was definitely not a
15:54 thing back in the day so I I created my
15:56 own network played around with deep Nets
15:58 shallow nets all of that stuff but only
16:01 for the purposes of Time series
16:03 forecasting right
16:05 um so that was my first exposure
16:08 um and then
16:10 um then I was doing search at rebuy so
16:12 this is my first company in in Berlin
16:15 a couple of years into my job
16:18 uh rebuy amazing company by the way is
16:21 uh plug to them and not that they need
16:24 it
16:25 um they offer Engineers uh 20 of the
16:29 week to work on pet projects uh the only
16:32 condition is the respect project should
16:33 not be completely ludicrous like if you
16:35 were to propose you want to learn
16:36 knitting they might say no but for any
16:39 Tech related projects they're super
16:41 super game uh a colleague of mine mitchu
16:44 uh love the guy by the way is he's
16:46 pissed I don't know where to be honest
16:48 these days but he's still at rebuy not
16:50 in Berlin anymore
16:52 um mature and I decided to work on spell
16:54 checker because that was a problem that
16:56 we were facing at the search uh search
17:00 product at 3 by
17:02 and we wanted to use the 20 time to work
17:06 uh to try and Implement a deep learning
17:08 spell checker
17:10 um long story short we did not succeed
17:12 but we learned a lot more about uh
17:15 machine learning about training
17:17 algorithms that also actually
17:20 kick-started the inspiration to then
17:22 start the search Tech Community in
17:24 Berlin which is a community we host
17:27 meetups uh Shameless plug to that as
17:29 well uh so I hope it's not uncommon for
17:33 people to plug things um activities
17:35 they're Associated that's why people
17:38 go come to them through the podcast I
17:40 guess
17:42 so you started this Meetup this
17:43 community while at eBay it was so well
17:46 right it was a while ago yes the
17:48 community I think it's over four years
17:50 old now no it's five six years old it's
17:52 an old racing Community we we actually
17:55 went on sabbatical during the most uh
17:57 most of the corona pandemic for two
17:59 years that's why it feels much shorter
18:00 than it actually is like two years of my
18:02 life have been erased I I forget to
18:05 factor that in so the community that
18:07 that's when it started uh it got me uh
18:11 connected to a lot of other people
18:12 working on search working on
18:14 recommendations because usually ranking
18:16 is a very common factor in both these
18:18 things
18:19 um and then somewhere during this time
18:22 in this community we were inspired both
18:24 Mitchie and I to give up deep learning
18:27 it's or give up the spell checker and
18:30 pick up recommendations as a as a
18:32 project as a problem that we wanted to
18:34 solve
18:35 uh we trained a few algorithms
18:38 um in the end uh word to back was very
18:41 popular in those days and a lot of teams
18:44 were doing I think
18:45 um what inspired us was probably a
18:48 Pinterest pin to vac or or maybe there's
18:51 a lot of these two Vex uh out there
18:54 where you actually find a paper or was
18:57 it like more a video no so we actually
19:00 tried to be honest met you I think is
19:02 more disciplined than I am in this we
19:04 did find a few official uh papers uh on
19:08 the word to back architecture
19:11 but then I think at the end it was
19:13 videos for me it was mainly going
19:15 through videos and actually hacking code
19:16 I gave up reading and just started doing
19:19 stuff uh I remember the word to back
19:22 model because that's the one that
19:23 succeeded in the end uh and a year from
19:26 there I think what ended up happening
19:28 was the search team became the search
19:30 and recommendation team before this
19:33 rebuy was buying recommendations from a
19:35 SAS provider and our model was actually
19:40 better we did some a b tests we were two
19:42 to three percent better in transactions
19:44 uh from recommendations compared to our
19:47 competition we ended up saving I think
19:49 half a million Euros or something for
19:51 the company uh with a model that we had
19:53 trained in the 20 of our time
19:58 um and then that was kind of like so
19:59 that was when I was very much involved
20:01 so uh the recommendation project was
20:03 something where we worked on the
20:06 training the the data engineering the
20:08 data Gathering you know all of the
20:09 nitty-gritties of probably what most
20:11 data scientists do today
20:14 um up to taking the model to production
20:17 hosting it on our AWS account
20:20 and then having a job that would retrain
20:22 it I had very little professional
20:24 experience in machine learning back then
20:26 so I think now that I've worked with
20:28 some amazing practitioners and machine
20:30 learning Engineers I laugh at what I had
20:32 pushed to production but it was not very
20:34 different from what the experts are
20:36 doing today so yeah so I'm just curious
20:39 like how much of the theory did you
20:42 already know and did you need to know to
20:44 actually do all of that or it was
20:46 completely hiking okay just it was it
20:49 was a lot of the internet is I love the
20:52 internet you don't need to know anything
20:53 you just copy paste and and Brute Force
20:56 till it works that that's one way that I
20:58 work and and it does work you know so
21:01 um
21:01 to be honest I understood the word to
21:04 back model after I had implemented my
21:07 like I mean to conceptually understand
21:08 why it works and what it does after I
21:11 saw it worked for the recommendations
21:13 before that for me it was just yeah
21:15 something that works there are a bunch
21:16 of companies that are using it
21:17 recommendations is one use case let's
21:20 see what we can do
21:21 I think it's pretty common pretty
21:23 typical for engineers this is how I was
21:26 this is how I learned this thing too
21:28 right so just try and see what happens
21:31 act before you think it's not a good
21:34 advice but for engineering and if
21:36 nobody's life depends upon it it's not
21:38 bad advice
21:39 oh how like what can possibly go wrong
21:43 if you're just on your laptop and
21:46 oh one thing if it's a production system
21:48 and then the entire search service goes
21:51 down right but then if it's just your
21:52 laptop and yours checking if this thing
21:55 is working or not then it's another
21:57 thing right
21:58 absolutely so one thing that I've always
22:00 told uh colleagues and also Engineers
22:02 who worked with me is if you've invest
22:06 in safety nets because once you have a
22:08 strong safety net you're not going to be
22:11 afraid to try stuff feature Flags
22:13 experimentation backups alerts
22:17 monitoring you know if you have a robust
22:19 system that is designed in a way that
22:24 failure is not if but when so it's never
22:27 a question of if you'll fail it's a
22:29 question of when you fail and prepare
22:31 for that uh and if you have that done
22:34 you can be very bold and make uh make
22:37 Maverick decisions and that's how you're
22:39 going to succeed because to be honest
22:40 it's a very fast paced world where we
22:42 live in we can't be cautious all the
22:44 time
22:46 so in summary just pick a project that
22:49 might benefit from machine learning
22:50 implement it make sure there are safety
22:52 nets so if anything goes wrong there is
22:55 a switch you can just take it down just
22:58 turn it off
22:59 and that's basically it right
23:03 that's your playground once you've got
23:05 your playground set up play because
23:06 that's the that's the only way you will
23:08 learn to be good at the game you have to
23:10 practice
23:11 another thing I tell myself is I'm not a
23:14 heart surgeon nobody's gonna die
23:17 so
23:18 yeah well maybe there is a user who
23:20 really wants to find this pair of shoes
23:22 and then because this search is done
23:24 they can't it's it's a few Euros or
23:27 dollars lost it's okay but but again
23:29 right
23:30 um we should uh yeah be bold don't be
23:33 afraid of making mistakes you learn more
23:36 from your mistakes than you will from
23:38 otherwise
23:39 okay so coming back to your oil leak
23:41 stays so you saw that there is a problem
23:43 and you wanted to solve it and then you
23:45 came and you were nearly right you just
23:47 joined and you came to the management
23:49 and said okay give me six months I'll
23:52 make some magic and then it will work
23:54 very fast
23:56 I did not promise magic I had an
23:58 architecture diagram okay I had proposed
24:00 um uh so to be honest it may sound
24:04 cooler than it is
24:06 like I said so before uh OLX I had done
24:08 search and delivery hero and before that
24:10 I had done search at rebuy okay
24:14 unsurprisingly so you've had some street
24:16 cred
24:17 not only did I have Street I had done
24:19 the exact same thing in those two jobs
24:23 that's how the business that's how the
24:25 industry evolves
24:27 um that's why you were hired right
24:29 I I guess uh that's also I mean when
24:31 companies are hiring when we are hiring
24:33 when I am hiring if you have prior
24:35 experience with what I'm planning on
24:38 doing you obviously uh have a better
24:40 chance
24:41 I was invited to the interview
24:44 because of the Meetup that I would host
24:48 uh people who had invited me and knew me
24:51 from before my interviews it helps to be
24:54 present in the community and to
24:56 like you said have Street Credit
24:58 definitely does help
25:00 okay so management trusts you with uh
25:04 working on that thing so you spent half
25:06 a year it works and then you get
25:08 promoted to an engineer manager was it
25:10 like that no no it wasn't it wasn't like
25:12 that
25:14 uh no so so but but there's definitely
25:19 uh this definitely was a very strong
25:22 point in in making it happen when it
25:25 happened so
25:26 um after after we had scaled out like uh
25:29 six to seven months later uh we were
25:32 also more certain about how the world
25:34 was evolving uh at this point now uh six
25:37 months into the pandemic online
25:39 businesses were thriving uh there was a
25:42 lot of business happening money was
25:44 flowing in so companies started to
25:46 reinvest in their uh in themselves right
25:49 uh the search team was growing we
25:52 engulfed uh there was a little bit of a
25:54 reorg and it became the relevance team
25:56 as it is now in its current uh
25:58 incarnation
26:01 um
26:02 and and then the idea was to develop
26:04 deliver customer value
26:07 um we were doing experiment after
26:09 experiment a B test after a B test broad
26:12 features were getting launched
26:14 um so it definitely did add to my
26:18 um I don't know to my credit that I did
26:20 advocate for something that was not very
26:23 obvious but it definitely helped helped
26:25 us uh move forward what was that uh the
26:29 the the the the decoupling project right
26:32 the moving out of search
26:34 um and then I guess to be honest the way
26:37 uh
26:39 how I became em was
26:41 my existing em decided to leave the
26:44 company
26:45 and that created so you need to have the
26:48 capability but you also need the
26:50 opportunity
26:51 and and you need luck to have them both
26:53 coincide and I think at this uh at this
26:57 time I had that around
26:58 my manager decided to leave OLX
27:02 um I had been at OLX now for I think a
27:05 year and a half
27:07 um or actually almost a year uh a year a
27:11 little more
27:13 um
27:13 and then things start falling in place I
27:15 I interviewed so the way we do it at OLX
27:18 is if an IC wants to move so I think
27:20 after a senior engineer uh especially a
27:23 senior engineer moving into an
27:25 engineering manager's position it's a
27:27 serious recruitment process I I went
27:29 through the entire process including the
27:32 the the the technical screening the
27:34 recruiter screen which
27:36 in my opinion seemed a little
27:37 Superfluous uh but but it was like as if
27:42 uh they were hiring somebody external
27:43 completely entire process complete it
27:46 was completely as if I was applying to
27:48 her the only thing that I had so I think
27:51 uh maybe since like that's also the
27:54 intention OLX wants to treat you as an
27:57 external because at the end of the day
28:00 we want the best person for the job
28:02 um there are certain benefits to being
28:05 an internal candidate is you can
28:07 showcase what you've done in the past
28:08 and they will believe you uh a hundred
28:11 percent because they see it where it
28:12 says I don't know if you're an external
28:14 candidate and you say you've done
28:15 something but you can't prove it or your
28:18 story doesn't add up that that could
28:20 raise suspicion right
28:22 um also as an internal candidate I could
28:25 ask for uh people I'd worked with in the
28:28 past to maybe give me a recommendation
28:29 or to put in a good word those are
28:32 things that may be some external
28:33 candidates might not but if you have
28:35 good Connections in the industry you
28:36 know that's also doable
28:38 uh yeah so I did the interview went
28:40 through the the entire process and and
28:43 then was I offered the position of the
28:45 Engineering Management research do you
28:47 remember the questions
28:49 uh
28:51 it wasn't related to search if this is
28:54 that if you're asking that what was it
28:55 related to so a lot of my interview was
28:58 related around people management
29:00 fun maybe maybe a little anecdote before
29:03 I applied for the EM for certain
29:06 recommendations there was another
29:07 internal opening at OLX in a different
29:09 part of the company for an Em's position
29:11 and I applied there as well and I was
29:13 actually rejected but after I got
29:16 rejected I spoke to the hiring manager
29:17 because we're all OLX employees and I
29:19 and he gave me an amazing breakdown of
29:21 uh why I failed or what I could so I he
29:25 what he said was you didn't really fail
29:27 but you probably need a little more uh
29:30 to two yeah something that external
29:34 candidates usually don't get right
29:35 exactly they won't get such a detailed
29:37 feedback and and you usually if you're
29:40 an external candidate your feedback is
29:42 delivered via the talent acquisition
29:44 team in this case I was directly talking
29:46 to the director of engineering who was
29:48 the hiring manager
29:50 um he gave me very good points I thank
29:52 him
29:53 for that even today Dion if you're there
29:56 if you're hearing he's at Flink now I
29:58 think leading their engineering team
29:59 amazing feedback I used a lot of that in
30:03 the second round
30:05 um and yeah and this time it was a
30:07 success so so what kind of people
30:10 management questions people can expect
30:12 maybe you don't give away the exact
30:13 questions you were asked because maybe
30:15 we still use these questions but like
30:18 just to to get an idea like is it about
30:21 conflict resolution is it about like
30:22 promoting people firing people or what
30:24 so to be honest the questions aren't
30:27 that important what the hiring manager
30:29 is trying to understand is are you a
30:31 person who is capable of leading the
30:34 team that is in question right usually
30:36 uh engineering manager or managerial
30:39 positions at least at OLX are very
30:40 specific to teams
30:43 um and and that's what they're trying to
30:44 understand if you have a team that is
30:46 riddled with conflict then they will be
30:48 looking out for a person who is better
30:49 at conflict resolution if you are trying
30:51 to lead a team that is very technical
30:53 and developing a platforms type of
30:56 solution you they'd look for a person
30:58 who's more technical uh than otherwise
31:01 right
31:02 um the advantage that I had with my
31:05 interview for the search team was I was
31:08 I would safely say I am well versed with
31:11 the field of search and recommendations
31:13 so I had that to my advantage
31:16 um and I had worked with this team I
31:19 have been working with this team so that
31:20 was also an advantage to me I guess
31:22 which weren't advantages in the other
31:25 interview that I had failed
31:27 um at the end of the day the hiring
31:29 manager wants to find a person who is
31:30 capable of leadership uh rallying the
31:34 team behind in in tough times
31:35 celebrating with the team in Good Times
31:39 um and is Gen in general is somebody
31:41 that the team looks up to respects
31:44 and is happy to work with uh and from a
31:48 business perspective uh the engineering
31:50 manager's job is to keep a healthy team
31:52 uh add business value
31:55 uh make sure that attrition is
31:58 controlled uh hiring new Engineers is
32:01 very expensive adding Replacements even
32:03 more so those are some business metrics
32:05 that need to be optimized and then any
32:06 person who can fit that profile and is
32:09 is the person for the job
32:11 but in terms of you know maybe any
32:14 action or by advice so suppose I want to
32:16 interview now for an engineering manager
32:18 position what can I expect like how can
32:22 I
32:23 proof of like all these things that you
32:25 said how can I prove that I can do them
32:28 so uh usually what also works is having
32:33 it's funny right the Chicken and the Egg
32:35 problem when you're in an interview
32:37 they'll ask you for evidence that you
32:39 have for example led a team in a
32:42 situation or or had experience in
32:44 resolving conflict inside a team
32:47 um
32:49 if you were if you're interested or
32:52 you're planning to to appear for such an
32:54 interview I would really uh ask you to
32:57 sit back and think about the instances
32:58 in your career where you have showed
33:00 leadership
33:01 uh it could be a small project that
33:02 you've learned it does not need to be a
33:04 group of 10 people it could be you and a
33:06 few other mates a college project that
33:08 you did right where you acted as a
33:10 leader to to Showcase that ability uh
33:14 conflict resolution and business Acumen
33:17 is something that is also important when
33:19 it comes to your positions you know so
33:20 when you understand things like this so
33:22 look back at your career
33:24 see instances where you have showed this
33:27 and and highlight those
33:30 so there was a conflict in one of the
33:33 projects that I had I should take a note
33:35 and then understand what were my actions
33:38 like how I helped to solve this conflict
33:40 and when the there is a question about
33:42 that I bring this up right
33:44 that's the kind of homework I need to do
33:46 that's the kind of homework that's the
33:48 kind of homework so uh uh Elias my old
33:51 manager who had to leave OLX for me to
33:53 get his position always asked me to
33:55 maintain a break list
33:57 s maintain your practice what is that so
34:01 whenever you do something worthy of
34:03 mention note it down because oftentimes
34:06 you forget you've been an awesome person
34:08 before and when it comes to such
34:10 interviews uh you it's very hard to lie
34:13 right these people who are interviewing
34:15 you they're experts so you can't
34:16 possibly lie to someone and get away
34:18 with it the only way is to actually tell
34:21 the truth and in order to tell the truth
34:23 you need to remember
34:25 that you've been in a situation like
34:27 this and generally in a 30 minute or 45
34:28 minute interview you cannot go through
34:31 your entire life so it's better to do
34:33 that before create your bright list and
34:36 then walk into the interview with your
34:37 practice
34:38 okay so did you actually have a top one
34:40 during the trigger
34:42 uh did I have a break list or no did you
34:45 have a top end on your screen when you
34:47 had the interview or you reviewed it
34:49 before the interview I reviewed it I
34:51 reviewed it before it was a Sublime Text
34:53 document very chaotic like most things I
34:55 do if I had it open during the interview
34:57 I would have crashed did you put it on
34:59 Dropbox sir how do you keep it no no so
35:02 so my method of organizing files is
35:04 never closing a Sublime Text document
35:10 your entire break list was there my
35:13 entire break it's still there to be
35:14 honest if I spin up I have like 300 tabs
35:17 in my Sublime Text that are basically
35:19 documents that are not final enough to
35:22 be saved but not untidy enough to be
35:25 forgotten
35:26 okay my breakfast is done with those
35:28 documents do you recommend this approach
35:30 no I absolutely do not recommend this
35:32 approach
35:34 um so what I have become that I've
35:36 become better right now is like I said
35:38 in the beginning or some time ago I use
35:40 Google Suites a lot so now I do organize
35:42 my life around Google Docs
35:44 um it's it's one of the best tools that
35:47 I have my favorite too yeah
35:49 so I am I'm moving gradually moving away
35:52 from Sublime
35:53 uh I wouldn't advise that to anybody
35:56 so what was the most difficult part of
35:59 your transition
36:02 so
36:03 um I don't know if a lot of uh ICS or
36:07 Engineers realize this or not but we
36:10 have a lot of dopamine in our daily life
36:13 you know you push I mean when you coach
36:15 right when you're coding right you you
36:17 you you create a merge request that's
36:19 damn dopamine you get an approval
36:21 another sort of dopamine you hit the
36:23 merge button dopamine deploy dopamine a
36:27 B test started dopamine right so does
36:28 dopamine throughout the day it is a very
36:32 addictive uh career and that's why
36:34 people enjoy it right that's why people
36:36 who are good at it get very successful
36:38 at it people spend time even after work
36:40 and it's a very
36:42 um it's interesting right for especially
36:44 uh challenging for people who are into
36:46 it
36:48 as a manager
36:49 those dopamine shorts stop so withdrawal
36:52 is what you go through really uh that
36:56 that is the analogy I really want to use
36:58 like a drug addict who stopped getting
37:00 his drugs and for me I had and so I I
37:03 was very close with my previous
37:05 engineering manager
37:07 um we spoke a lot about the the
37:09 possibility you know the what would
37:10 happen during the transition he prepared
37:13 me for taking on the team so there was a
37:15 lot of prep work that goes into it some
37:17 people are lucky enough to have a mentor
37:19 like I had uh and and some just you know
37:22 figure it out you learned you learn how
37:24 to ride a bicycle by riding a bicycle
37:27 um
37:28 but nothing prepared me for what I
37:31 actually felt uh the first few weeks
37:34 when you have
37:36 nothing the thing is the the
37:39 time it takes to see impact stretches
37:42 from hours or minutes to weeks months
37:45 Maybe
37:46 a quarters sometimes
37:48 and here because the impact is not done
37:51 by you right you need to coordinate this
37:54 impact you need to make it happen but
37:55 not yourself
37:57 and so that's the thing but not yourself
37:58 and that's a very key component so what
38:01 a lot of early managers do I think I've
38:03 done this is when you're not getting
38:05 that dopamine you immediately lapse and
38:08 you go back to becoming an IC and you
38:10 start coding again because there is your
38:12 shot of dopamine you feel that hit now
38:14 I'm useful I'm doing something again
38:17 and then I I did that same mistake so I
38:19 went back to coding because that was
38:21 easy for me right
38:22 but then at some point it I realized
38:24 that every minute that I am sitting with
38:27 my IDE writing code is a minute that I
38:30 am not doing something more important
38:31 for my entire team
38:33 which could be talking to another
38:34 stakeholder somewhere convincing them
38:36 getting their buy-in for a crazy project
38:38 that we want to do talking to a data
38:40 science manager to get his team to
38:42 implement the data science model every
38:44 minute that I was with my IDE was a
38:46 minute I was not doing those things
38:48 but somebody has to do those things so
38:50 they would start stacking up and then
38:52 you are just sitting at your computer at
38:54 8 pm writing slack messages to people
38:56 your day becomes crazy you have to stop
39:00 being an IC and start focusing on what
39:03 means how do you get your dopamine dose
39:07 then
39:08 all right so one chocolates uh I do have
39:12 some chocolate bars on my desk right now
39:13 but no that's not how how you should be
39:15 doing it otherwise you put on a lot of
39:17 weight
39:18 um so one is be prepared right
39:20 um no matter how prepared you think you
39:24 are understand that you're not prepared
39:26 because what you are losing out is is
39:28 quite a bit
39:30 um trust in the people that you've
39:33 talked about talked with uh about this
39:35 transition in the past your mentors uh
39:38 other people from the community uh from
39:40 the industry they know what they're
39:42 talking about
39:43 uh it's this is a longer game I don't
39:47 play golf but I am imagine this is how
39:49 golf would seem like you know you just
39:51 keep going behind the ball short after
39:52 shot and then three hours later damn
39:55 somebody's a winner I don't know how
39:57 that game were chess made it too chess
39:59 maybe but in chess also the minute you
40:01 take down an opponent's uh thing there's
40:04 a bit of dopamine there ah right
40:07 so you know chess can be a very
40:09 fast-paced game this is really think of
40:11 the most boring game and then that is
40:13 your analysis it's golf right
40:15 golf is what comes to my mind
40:19 um but but so and you need to be very
40:21 strategic so think about it what what
40:23 you need to do is at least what worked
40:25 for me is pick up a project
40:28 and make that project your source of
40:32 dopamine or completion of this project
40:33 right and then and then drive it put all
40:36 your energy into that a month or a
40:38 quarter later when you've delivered it
40:41 the project you mean that you work on as
40:44 an AC or you have other people work on
40:47 so um my project what I mean is
40:52 something that is now on your desk right
40:55 this could be something that you were
40:56 working on in the past or necessarily
40:58 but something that needs to be done now
40:59 for the team uh pick that up talk to
41:02 your engineers or or to whoever is on
41:04 your team talk to stakeholders invest
41:08 yourself in in completing this uh focus
41:12 on on one project at least that works
41:15 for me like laser focus on one project
41:17 and you learn a lot from the mistakes
41:20 that you will do during the execution of
41:22 this project but when you have reached
41:24 the end
41:26 and then when you get that one big shot
41:29 of dopamine
41:31 and if you are cut out for it right
41:33 because I think a lot of people just
41:34 aren't cut out for the job
41:36 if you're cut out for it you'll know
41:38 you've made the right decision and if
41:40 you're not you know you've made the
41:41 wrong decision and then you will
41:42 gradually try to go back to where you
41:45 were before but to tell tell us more
41:48 about this project so I I don't think I
41:49 understood so this is a project on which
41:52 you work as an actual developer like you
41:54 actually go there no no no no no no
41:56 sorry or you have somebody somebody work
41:59 on it somebody work on it right but what
42:00 I meant was a project that needs to be
42:03 done that needs to be executed in your
42:06 team you're leading this team
42:08 exactly your team has to execute this
42:11 project and you're the leader they're
42:13 behind you they're supporting you but
42:15 you have to bring it home but what if
42:19 you're craving a little bit of dopamine
42:20 before because that will happen in three
42:22 months right but you want to have to
42:24 open me now
42:25 uh so Milestones that's what happens
42:28 okay set Milestones then you have clear
42:31 milestones and if you're doing it right
42:34 your Milestone should not be a quarter
42:35 ahead it should be more like a Sprint
42:37 ahead uh those can be but I think for uh
42:42 early on in your management career it
42:44 might be very hard to get all of this
42:46 right
42:47 um I've made my mistakes people who are
42:49 listening are going to make their own
42:50 mistakes uh but in the end I think uh
42:53 what what I want you to take home is
42:55 understand that it is a complete
42:57 different reward structure
43:00 uh your reward is going to be much
43:03 bigger
43:04 and much more satisfying if you are into
43:06 it
43:07 but it will come at a delayed time
43:11 can't we also wanted to talk about what
43:14 you do now all right which is not
43:15 engineering manager anymore but data
43:18 science management so tell us about that
43:21 so I think the maybe it was something
43:24 similar so you worked as an engineering
43:26 management manager for some time right
43:28 and then you apply it for a data science
43:30 manager position
43:32 I went I went through the interview
43:34 process uh the way we hire data
43:37 scientists at OLX is is very interesting
43:39 I love the process by the way is we have
43:41 a panel interview which we don't have
43:43 for engineering
43:45 um so I had to go through the panel
43:46 interview
43:47 um I did not have to go through the
43:49 recruiter screen this time so thank you
43:52 recruiting team for that uh but I did go
43:55 through the panel interview I had to
43:57 present my case I was given a case study
44:00 um and asked me on how I would execute
44:03 it I spoke with my team uh the my future
44:06 team the one I would be taking up I
44:08 spoke with the manager who was leading
44:09 the team I spoke with leaders inside
44:11 data science
44:12 uh because I also had a lot of anxiety I
44:15 wasn't sure I was I wanted to do this I
44:17 desperately wanted to do the transition
44:19 because I had always been on the margins
44:21 with data science right I had played
44:23 with models but never owned them I
44:25 deployed models but never really
44:27 controlled them I wanted it was it I
44:30 wanted in on the fun
44:33 so that's why you decided to apply for a
44:35 data science manager position
44:38 so uh my understanding the the way I see
44:42 uh my work is there were challenges that
44:46 I had as an engineering manager that
44:48 that were fun but in data science I
44:51 enjoyed the chat I I feel like I'm I'm
44:53 enjoying the challenges more because the
44:54 problems are less defined uh it's a
44:57 little harder to to understand what
45:00 really needs to be done uh Building
45:02 Solutions is not as straightforward
45:05 but once they're done so again it's more
45:07 it's the dopamine is even further
45:09 delayed now but it's even bigger chunks
45:12 for example
45:14 um
45:15 there's a topic that I have on my plate
45:16 that I could maybe share is regarding
45:18 chat and and moderation so the currently
45:21 I'm leading a team of data scientists
45:23 who are part of the trust and safety
45:25 pillar at OLX and and what we do here
45:28 maybe just a little bit about that
45:29 before I get into some kind of problem
45:31 challenges that we face
45:33 is OLX as most of your viewers by now
45:36 know because you've been at this company
45:38 for a while uh is is a platform where
45:41 user which which facilitates user to
45:43 user sales right
45:46 so the all of the content is user
45:48 generated
45:49 and you can imagine that people are
45:52 creative they always want to game the
45:55 system or fool the system or abuse the
45:58 system
45:59 our users are no different and we have a
46:02 very strong team of people in operations
46:05 some moderators product engineering and
46:07 data that are Building Solutions to make
46:10 sure that content that is against our
46:12 privacy policies are sorry against our
46:15 community policies
46:17 are is not allowed to go live
46:21 uh and this includes for example even
46:23 chat messages right you could imagine
46:24 people trying to abuse each other in
46:26 chat or scam other unsuspecting users
46:30 and this is a big uh preventing this is
46:34 part of my team's job
46:37 but that is the problem like how you so
46:40 the problem is people want to chat with
46:42 each other they're good people who want
46:43 to chat with each other and they're bad
46:45 people identify the Bad actors by the
46:48 messages whatever stop it from happening
46:51 uh which is uh somewhat different like
46:54 uh than the challenges that I had in my
46:56 engineering team which were a little
46:58 more defined
47:00 um
47:01 and yeah now I get to uh work with data
47:05 scientists uh discussing on machine
47:07 learning Solutions in this case a lot of
47:10 NLP understanding the context of not
47:14 just a message but uh the entire chat
47:16 right like what really is happening here
47:19 is this a genuine conversation or is
47:22 this somewhat fraudulent is one person
47:24 abusing the other are Community
47:27 guidelines being violated here uh so our
47:30 idea is to develop a solution that would
47:33 comprehensively understand
47:35 uh what human communication is about and
47:39 then make a decision versus the
47:41 engineering approach which is I'm going
47:42 to put a filter for the word and if
47:46 somebody types it I will block it
47:49 how much do you think data science
47:51 manager should know about all these
47:53 things because like NLP is a pretty
47:57 large topic right Misha I don't know
48:00 like there are a lot of things happening
48:02 there right so
48:03 maybe coming from the software
48:05 engineering background you don't
48:06 necessarily know it in depth so how much
48:09 of this do you need to know to be
48:11 helpful for team or like do you even
48:13 need to know that or as a manager you
48:16 help differently not by
48:18 pointing to papers
48:20 right I I don't Point people to papers
48:23 they Point Community papers
48:25 um
48:25 I think there are different types of
48:27 manager archetypes you'll always have
48:28 the the manager who's a domain expert
48:30 and is going to lead by
48:33 you know being the domain expert
48:36 I am not a domain expert neither in uh
48:38 the topics of trust and safety nor am I
48:41 an expert in topics of machine learning
48:43 or data science so my my focus is uh
48:47 genuinely around coordination I do
48:48 understand machine learning and data
48:51 science to a degree where I can have an
48:53 informed discussion with product and
48:54 tell them that hey this is a problem we
48:56 can attempt to solve versus this is a
48:58 problem that is better solved with an
49:00 engineering solution or better solved
49:01 with human in the loop solution uh but
49:05 from then on my job is to filter the
49:08 right kind of problems set the right
49:10 kind of success metrics and share that
49:12 with my team and then they they take it
49:14 from there right they propose the
49:15 solutions they propose the models I am
49:18 part of the discussions because I'm
49:19 genuinely curious as to how they
49:21 function how they how they propose these
49:23 things but I am not a contributor to a
49:26 great deal uh in any of these
49:28 discussions so to answer the question
49:30 how much do you know I think it's it's
49:32 definitely helpful to know if the
49:34 problem that is being discussed test
49:37 will have a successful machine learning
49:39 solution or not that definitely helps
49:41 you but beyond that it's not necessary
49:44 if you know I think it's going to be fun
49:46 but it's not absolutely not necessary
49:48 and then I guess for mentoring the team
49:51 you rely on more senior team members yes
49:54 so the way we structure that relax you
49:56 yourself are a principal and I have
49:57 spoken to you on occasion to help people
49:59 in my team upskill with Technologies so
50:03 that's also coordinate right I know
50:05 there are people who are better at this
50:07 than I am
50:09 why should I be kind of like I just
50:12 connect experts to people and then
50:14 that's it I facilitate discussions but I
50:17 don't drive or own them how much
50:21 different is your job plan from what you
50:23 were doing previously so now I guess you
50:25 have more interaction with stakeholders
50:27 and the nature of this interaction is
50:29 slightly different right because you
50:31 need to keep in mind like all these
50:33 things that you mentioned like does it
50:34 need a machine learning solution or we
50:36 can just go with a pure software
50:37 engineering solution I.E filters right
50:39 yeah uh and things like that is this the
50:42 main difference
50:43 so I think um so this is I think a
50:46 significant part of the difference yes
50:48 um I am way more involved in product
50:50 discussions than I was previously
50:53 but I also think that a part of this is
50:55 how your company looks at the different
50:58 profiles
51:00 um and I think at OLX a data science
51:03 manager is is really a counterpart to
51:06 product and engineering and and my job
51:09 the way I see it is to work with the
51:13 others of the product and Technology
51:14 side to propose better Solutions uh to
51:18 help them make decisions and and at the
51:21 end Drive customer value and business
51:23 value so yeah so so I guess it's it's my
51:27 discussions are far less technical now
51:29 and far more impactful than they were
51:32 previously
51:33 do you think you could have just jumped
51:35 one of the roles
51:37 I mean from software yes keep the EM
51:40 part yeah
51:42 so I think so here's my honest take
51:45 right like I said you'll always have to
51:48 prove yourself before somebody gives you
51:49 the keys
51:50 how does a software engineer prove that
51:53 he can be a good data science manager
51:55 I'm not saying it's impossible but I
51:57 think oh well you did a fair amount of
52:00 uh ml related stuff as a back-end
52:03 developer could I have done it uh I
52:07 think or you were just helping right
52:09 we'd have to ask the the hiring manager
52:11 if they would have taken me what I do
52:13 know is during my interview for my
52:16 current role as a data science manager
52:18 I did use a lot of my success stories
52:21 from my previous role which was an
52:22 engineering manager's role to take home
52:25 this position uh had those success
52:27 stories not existed would I have still
52:31 been given the opportunity is something
52:33 that the hiring manager around those and
52:35 the committee that interviews like I
52:37 said we had a panel interview so the
52:39 panelists but as an engineering manager
52:42 in the search team and recommendations
52:44 team you got involved in all this
52:47 machine learning related topics right on
52:49 which gave you some credibility right
52:52 definitely so so one of the benefits of
52:54 being an engineer manager for the search
52:55 and recommendations team for me
52:56 personally was this is one team that
52:58 works very closely with data science
53:01 um we are at least or we were the the
53:04 recommendations the relevance team is a
53:07 big contributor to the success of the
53:08 data science all right so this also not
53:10 only did it give me the platform but it
53:12 also allowed me to Showcase my working
53:15 style uh who I am and what I do to my
53:18 future employers that definitely added
53:21 value
53:23 and the future employers here yeah are
53:25 the same company the same company the
53:28 same company the different a different
53:29 hiring manager if you will
53:31 yeah well we have a few questions so one
53:34 of the questions I don't know if you can
53:35 answer this but maybe you saw some of
53:37 your colleagues did this so the question
53:39 is what are the challenges on getting
53:41 the data science managerial position
53:43 from other roles for example data
53:45 engineering or analysis I think you were
53:48 doing something similar to data
53:49 engineering right to some extent yeah so
53:52 that's uh we actually talked about that
53:55 more or less right
53:57 so I guess it I guess it shouldn't be
54:00 difficult depending on what your hiring
54:01 manager or the team potential team that
54:03 your company that you're applying to
54:05 what they're looking for I would say
54:06 with that experience so if you have
54:08 experience as a data engineer or a data
54:10 analyst I think you know
54:12 a fair deal of how the data science
54:14 teams would work uh you also understand
54:16 a lot of the stakeholders so that is to
54:17 your advantage you need to focus on your
54:20 leadership skills why are you the right
54:23 person to lead with this team and if you
54:25 can convince them about that then I
54:26 think you should get the top that's the
54:28 homework we talked about when talking
54:31 about getting an engineering management
54:32 manager position yes which is your brand
54:36 list
54:36 so like the all that way advice you
54:40 shared with us about this em position
54:42 applies to also applies also to data
54:45 science yeah exactly definitely a place
54:49 okay but keep this bright list in a
54:51 Google Document not keep it in a Google
54:54 doc not in an unsaved Sublime Text
54:56 document
54:57 why did you not save it
55:00 so every time I I try to save it
55:04 um I filed them I think I don't know I I
55:07 don't know no reason I'm thinking about
55:08 it there's no reason I could have just
55:10 called it drag list or txt and saved it
55:12 or whatever I didn't want to call it a
55:15 break list maybe a little bit of that uh
55:19 you know the name is
55:21 yeah maybe okay
55:23 it's an outrageous name work at least
55:28 accomplishments
55:32 accomplishments that's better name it's
55:34 still called Blacklist on my Google Docs
55:36 now to be honestly yeah so you still
55:39 keep it I still have it I still add to
55:41 it whenever I feel that I have done
55:43 something worth mentioning
55:45 um yeah but how do you
55:48 live with the because on you actually
55:51 didn't do it right somebody else did
55:53 this you were just standing there at
55:56 least this is when I was uh this is how
55:59 I felt listen so what you need to
56:01 understand and this is a very good
56:02 question
56:04 um yes and no because the thing is had
56:07 you not been there do you think similar
56:10 outcomes would have been achieved
56:18 but you can for example look at uh go
56:22 through the product the Journey of the
56:24 the team or the project and and see
56:27 areas where you had key insight
56:30 and when uh what you uncovered or what
56:34 you discussed changed the direction of
56:37 uh yeah the project
56:40 um and and this is going to be there I
56:42 mean if you are doing your job right you
56:44 are going to find instances where had
56:46 you not been present the outcome would
56:49 have been slightly or significantly
56:51 different and that is what
56:53 differentiates a good manager program I
56:54 mean at the end of the day if you are
56:56 getting paid and I believe this firmly
56:57 if I am getting paid to do something the
57:00 value that I bring should be more than
57:02 the value that I take out right it's
57:05 it's simple math that's the validation
57:07 right if you check your bank account and
57:10 you see some money then you're still
57:12 doing well right
57:16 yeah sometimes it takes uh no but I
57:19 would want to evaluate it even closer
57:22 not only on that that is definitely a
57:25 very good evaluation but I would also
57:27 want to have other health metrics so to
57:29 say what are those metrics
57:32 uh so for example one thing that I do
57:35 look out and this isn't very concrete or
57:38 very like I don't know so what I do look
57:41 out for is whenever I'm having like for
57:43 example now as a data science manager uh
57:45 I have a lot of interactions with
57:46 stakeholders and product managers and
57:48 Engineering managers and the amount of
57:50 influence that I have where I can change
57:52 their opinion from one to another
57:55 and then does does my the my proposed
57:58 solution deliver value if a and b are
58:02 there then I am very happy at consuming
58:04 the money that my employer deposited in
58:07 my bank account
58:08 if not
58:09 I would want to get feedback and improve
58:12 okay and you put these things in your
58:14 break list
58:15 uh some of it so when it's successful it
58:19 ends up in the crack list uh but when
58:21 it's in progress
58:22 there's probably another unsafe okay
58:28 do you have any books or other resources
58:31 in mind that you can recommend to the
58:33 listeners
58:35 so um I have read a few books on
58:38 management I can recommend a few books
58:40 and management but my style has always
58:42 been
58:43 ride a bicycle to learn how to ride a
58:46 bicycle you have to do it before you in
58:49 order to understand how it's done
58:51 um it's a very agile methodology start
58:53 and then iterate and improve
58:56 um one book that I read was it's called
58:58 the manager's path it's written by a
59:01 Facebook employee or a next Facebook
59:03 employee and she kind of describes her
59:05 journey uh from the early days of
59:08 Facebook and how it scales I think that
59:09 one definitely helped me there are a few
59:11 other books that don't stand out uh
59:14 because all of the stuff that you read
59:15 in them is stuff like you hear in a
59:17 podcast like this right somebody else's
59:20 Journey it might or might not relate to
59:22 you
59:23 make your own journey I saw this book
59:26 actually to elixit uh
59:28 it's the best of quite a few people yeah
59:31 especially those who just became
59:33 engineering managers I saw that they
59:35 have they had this book on their desks
59:39 it was before Corona when people
59:40 actually came to the office
59:43 there's another this one from the
59:46 founders of Netflix no rules rules it's
59:48 more about culture uh how you want to
59:50 drive your teams culture I think that's
59:52 a very important part of being a team
59:53 leader that that's I like that book it's
59:55 it's Unique we are definitely not
59:58 running OLX with those principles but
1:00:00 it's nice to see how you know how
1:00:03 certain rules uh are maybe Superfluous
1:00:06 and and can be done away with
1:00:09 um yeah
1:00:10 I think the story is make your own
1:00:13 journal understand and learn from others
1:00:16 but make your own when is the next
1:00:18 search Meetup meeting
1:00:21 oh so glad you asked uh it's not I'm not
1:00:25 hosting this one under the banner of the
1:00:26 search Meetup but I am going to be
1:00:28 hosting another Meetup at OLX on the 7th
1:00:31 of December uh 6 p.m the topics are
1:00:36 going to be around bias and fairness in
1:00:38 AI how would you measure that and how
1:00:40 would you counter for that it's Co-op
1:00:43 organized by wonderful people at teloka
1:00:46 which is kind of like Amazon perk or
1:00:50 it's like yeah human annotation right
1:00:53 um crowdsourcing yeah crowdsourcing
1:00:55 thank you for that term yes uh yeah so
1:00:58 if you're in Berlin and if you want to
1:01:01 enjoy good food good conversation and
1:01:03 networking with great people then show
1:01:05 up at our offices at alexanderplatz
1:01:08 okay you might also see Alexa there I
1:01:12 don't promise that but but you and that
1:01:15 you definitely will yes
1:01:19 okay well thanks a lot to that it was
1:01:22 pleasure talking to you thanks for
1:01:23 sharing all this um stories your
1:01:26 experience
1:01:27 um yeah that was fun and thanks everyone
1:01:30 also for being here
1:01:32 yeah thank you thank you this is a
1:01:34 pleasure have a nice day
