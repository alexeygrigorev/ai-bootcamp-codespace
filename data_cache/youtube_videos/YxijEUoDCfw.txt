0:17 haven't subscribed to our youtube
0:18 channel do it now you will not regret
0:21 you will get a lot of nice videos in
0:23 your feed like this one
0:25 and then of course the most important
0:27 thing if you haven't joined our slack
0:28 community do it now
0:31 you can hang out with other data into
0:33 just there
0:35 um yeah last thing we started the course
0:38 last week already or was it this week
0:40 yeah i think this week so there is a
0:42 course free course about envelopes so if
0:45 you're interested in this kind of stuff
0:46 there is also a link in the description
0:49 and check it out it's quite interesting
0:51 and then
0:53 lastly if you have any questions during
0:55 today's interview there is a pinned link
0:58 in the live chat click on this link ask
1:00 your question and i will be covering
1:02 your questions during the interview
1:05 so that is the introduction now i
1:08 stopped sharing my screen
1:09 i find the questions that i prepared for
1:12 you
1:14 so i have the questions
1:17 should we start
1:19 yeah let's do it
1:21 okay so this week we'll talk about
1:24 extracting space resources from
1:26 asteroids and we have a special guest
1:28 today danan danan and his co-founders
1:30 created carmen plus to mine near-earth
1:33 asteroids
1:34 and previously he worked as a data
1:36 scientist so i thought it would be a
1:38 great idea to invite him to talk about
1:40 applications of data science
1:42 for
1:43 mining asteroids specifically and for
1:46 astronomy in general welcome
1:48 thank you good to be here
1:51 before we go into our main topic of
1:53 astronomy and data and mining asteroids
1:56 let's start with your background can you
1:58 tell us about your career journey so far
2:00 yeah so i you know when i was younger i
2:03 was very interested in astronomy and
2:05 science and as an undergrad uh took a
2:08 heavy course load in physics and
2:10 astronomy and cosmology actually was one
2:12 of my favorite classes and i also uh
2:15 took some courses in neuropsychology and
2:19 cognitive perception um and was
2:21 interested in research and thought very
2:23 heavily about going into a career in
2:25 academics but for a number of reasons
2:27 just didn't feel that that was the path
2:29 for me i was also interested in public
2:30 service and so when i graduated i ended
2:32 up doing work with a non-profit here in
2:34 new york city where i live and i kind of
2:36 spun my career into you know combination
2:38 of public service uh finance uh
2:41 politics i ran a congressional campaign
2:43 that's a whole other podcast uh i'll
2:46 spare you uh but i ended up working for
2:47 the new york city mayor's office under
2:49 michael bloomberg
2:50 about 10 years ago after hurricane sandy
2:53 hit the city and it was you know a very
2:56 impactful job and i love the people i
2:58 worked with and it was a trajectory
3:00 where i could see a lot of possibility
3:01 in the future and interesting work but
3:03 my heart wasn't in it and i realized
3:05 when i thought back to the fork in the
3:06 road for me that was
3:08 leaving science and i wanted to get back
3:10 to that i wanted to work
3:11 and problem solve with data and i went
3:14 back to school at nyu to sort of pivot
3:17 my career and uh got a degree in
3:18 informatics and a couple of very close
3:21 advisors of mine were actually
3:22 astrophysicists at practicing academics
3:25 and
3:26 must much of what i learned as a data
3:27 science scientist i learned from them uh
3:30 and uh really appreciated it uh and uh
3:32 after i graduated i ended up working and
3:34 i thought about getting a phd but at
3:36 that point it was just not feasible
3:38 economically or otherwise and i also
3:40 wanted to kind of jump in and get my
3:41 hands dirty so i ended up working in
3:43 industry uh worked for a great company
3:46 called geophy worked with the world bank
3:48 i worked with the united states federal
3:50 emergency management agency uh with a
3:53 company called new light technologies uh
3:56 mostly working with remote sensing and
3:58 so the last several years i've been able
4:00 to do a lot of work with um
4:02 data analysis and machine learning
4:03 related to remote sensing and making
4:05 sense of that data uh and about a year
4:07 ago i got a call from a former colleague
4:09 of mine who said hey i'm
4:11 starting an asteroid mining company uh
4:14 resources are important we want to go
4:15 find them at asteroids do you want to
4:17 help me build the science and
4:18 engineering team and i said sure i'm in
4:20 uh
4:21 it was maybe a little bit longer
4:22 conversation than that but it basically
4:24 kind of came down to that
4:26 and so a few months ago i quit my job
4:28 full-time and have been doing this and
4:29 building the team out and helping design
4:31 our strategy and uh uh you know some
4:34 things are the same i still on my best
4:36 days work with data and it's a big messy
4:38 soup and i'm looking for patterns uh
4:40 some things are different i now as a
4:42 co-founder i have to think about the
4:44 business a lot more as and we're looking
4:46 for asteroids that's a new thing for me
4:48 so uh so yeah that's what brings us here
4:52 so you mentioned a couple of interesting
4:54 things and i wanted to go way back when
4:56 you said you studied astronomy and also
4:59 cosmology
5:01 are there any differences isn't it the
5:03 same thing
5:04 oh good question well uh i guess one big
5:07 difference is uh time scales and
5:09 astronomy are pretty massive but you can
5:11 even think about it in millions of years
5:13 whereas cosmology we were talking
5:16 billions of years
5:17 um my sister is an academic and studies
5:20 uh she's a philosopher in physics and
5:22 she looks at things like quantum field
5:24 theory and in cosmology and there you're
5:26 really pushing the edge of theory um
5:29 because you're thinking about things
5:30 that we don't even know how well our
5:32 physical laws hold up in certain states
5:34 or what we can know about them
5:36 it gets interesting you certainly aren't
5:38 able to do experiments in the same way
5:40 whereas astronomy is at least a little
5:42 bit more focused in my mind i guess on
5:44 on what you can observe
5:46 immediately and so they're very closely
5:49 related but i i yeah i see cosmology is
5:51 is uh
5:52 um
5:53 i don't know so it's fascinating to
5:55 think about our universe and that broad
5:56 perspective uh very related of course
5:59 and and and one drives the other for
6:01 sure
6:03 okay so i the next question i wanted to
6:05 ask you was about applications of data
6:08 science and machine learning for
6:09 astronomy
6:10 but before that
6:13 other applications for cosmology of data
6:16 science and machine learning um
6:18 well um you know i i think whenever
6:21 you're looking at massive amounts of
6:23 data and we're getting more data um
6:26 uh the answer is always yes if you need
6:28 if you have a lot of data that you need
6:29 to understand data science
6:31 is
6:32 i think directly at the applicable there
6:34 and cosmology is probably in need of it
6:36 um i i love talking about ligo the the
6:40 light interferometer gravitational wave
6:41 observatory and the detection of
6:44 gravitational waves which are traveling
6:46 across billions of light years uh that
6:49 is pretty fascinating and there's so
6:50 much we can learn about the creation of
6:52 our universe i believe and how it exists
6:54 and where and how it's moving uh and
6:57 obviously parsing that data as with the
6:59 large hadron collider you're dealing
7:00 with a pretty massive amount of data
7:02 information how much of that is noise
7:04 how much that is some signal what is the
7:06 signal telling us so i think from a
7:08 cosmological perspective there certainly
7:10 are a certain need for data science and
7:12 machine learning
7:14 and i'm sure someone could speak more
7:15 intelligently on that than i but um but
7:17 yeah
7:18 it's there
7:20 yeah so gravitational waves and yeah i'm
7:23 wondering like how much we
7:25 people from earth can observe
7:28 like with this gravitational waves like
7:30 how much signal is there how much noise
7:32 is there and how well there's there's
7:34 there's uh enough to actually make some
7:36 pretty interesting discoveries so the
7:37 fact that we're now with some regularity
7:39 detecting not only black holes crashing
7:42 into each other which is a thing that
7:43 happens by the way if you didn't know
7:45 that um but neutron stars uh and so uh
7:48 it's pretty fascinating there's even an
7:50 anecdote i know a few years ago in 2017
7:52 they had detected what they thought was
7:54 neutron stars colliding there are two
7:56 detectors in the us in washington state
7:58 and in louisiana one of them detected
8:00 this
8:01 unmistakable signal or so they thought
8:03 the other detector did not so by their
8:05 own rules they thought well this is an
8:07 anomaly or it's not a true detection but
8:10 it was confusing because there there was
8:12 so clear there's a third detector in
8:14 italy that also didn't detect it well it
8:16 turns out the one in louisiana had uh
8:18 what they call a glitch which is a noise
8:20 these are very sensitive instruments and
8:22 so maybe a jackhammer was going off or
8:24 something
8:25 and they scrubbed the noise at just the
8:28 right time that the the the signal
8:30 happened which is a low
8:32 frequent probability but it it can
8:34 happen
8:35 uh and sure enough when a postdoc went
8:37 back and looked at the data they saw
8:38 that that glitch was there and when they
8:40 were able to um
8:42 mask around it they were able to see the
8:43 signal so indeed it had been there but
8:45 the automated and this is a sort of i
8:47 use this as an anecdote for why you need
8:49 science in addition to machine learning
8:51 the automated pipeline obviously
8:53 didn't detect it and didn't understand
8:55 that that was a signal
8:57 what's also fascinating about this story
8:59 is that third detector in italy also
9:00 didn't detect it and the reason there is
9:03 likely because as gravity
9:05 is oscillating through space in three
9:07 dimensions well four i guess if you
9:09 include time
9:11 the detectors are actually two lasers
9:13 that are
9:14 optimized for two dimensions and so if
9:16 they're oriented in just the right spot
9:18 there's a blind spot so it just so
9:20 happened that this italian detector was
9:23 the blind spot was where the gravity
9:25 waves were coming from so you have the
9:27 sort of combination of coincidences and
9:29 physics and all kinds of things around
9:30 the story that i find quite fascinating
9:32 but uh not to go into tangible to answer
9:34 your question yes as humans we can
9:36 detect gravity that's pretty cool nice
9:39 okay so going back to astronomy so there
9:42 are
9:43 applications of machine learning and
9:45 data science there as well can you tell
9:46 us how it's used yeah so you know data
9:50 science you know i look at it data
9:51 analysis you know information theory
9:53 there's a lot of things related to that
9:55 and so generative processes are
9:56 important part of how i think about data
9:58 science so if you're an astronomer your
10:00 proximate generative processes are
10:02 usually involving some detector you know
10:04 a sensor a camera maybe a radio antenna
10:07 you're measuring energy that's been
10:09 collected and how that energy is
10:10 measured and put into a numerical array
10:12 is critically important for you to
10:14 understand so understanding those
10:15 generative processes i mean even beyond
10:17 that you know what are you observing
10:19 what natural phenomena
10:21 obviously deep space astronomers are
10:22 looking at you know quasars galaxies
10:25 black holes uh pulsars all kinds of
10:27 things exoplanets in solar system
10:29 astronomy we're looking at objects
10:30 moving around the sun and so
10:32 uh we're seeing light reflected from the
10:35 sun off an object and that can tell us a
10:37 great deal about that object uh
10:38 certainly for asteroids that's a big
10:40 part of what we're interested in um how
10:42 you pull these things together across
10:43 different platforms takes on more of the
10:45 data engineering need because there are
10:47 a lot of complex science and data
10:49 pipelines built around these
10:51 observatories that you have to really
10:53 understand and structure
10:54 signal processing is a major component
10:57 certainly of the data science side
10:58 exploratory data analysis
11:00 i think is pretty underrated i love
11:02 doing exploratory data analysis you can
11:03 see patterns and things in the in the
11:05 data you're looking at
11:07 um and then in machine learning i mean
11:09 there's so many different tasks that are
11:11 applicable but i think a lot of it can
11:12 kind of come down to you know machine
11:14 learning you know labels things there's
11:16 a lot of things to label in astronomy um
11:19 and if you're looking at computer vision
11:20 you want to find sources is this pixel
11:23 part of a source is it the adjacent
11:24 pixel part of the same source how do you
11:26 know
11:28 you know exercise is related to that
11:31 signal processing again when you're
11:32 trying to figure out how to denoise an
11:34 image and make some choices about what
11:36 is noise because everything is
11:37 information some information you can
11:39 ignore
11:40 machine learning is great for scaling
11:42 those tasks out uh time series analysis
11:44 is a major one clustering uh of all
11:47 kinds of things spectral data you name
11:49 it dimension reduction i've used quite a
11:51 bit you know where probably a lot of
11:52 people data scientists at least are
11:55 familiar with principal component
11:56 analysis it's a bit finicky you have to
11:58 have data that's fairly well normalized
12:01 that's well conditioned
12:03 i like looking at auto encoders have
12:04 been very popular in terms of techniques
12:06 for dealing with dimension reduction
12:08 among other things
12:10 so i think there's a lot of opportunity
12:11 there
12:12 super resolution using generative
12:14 adversarial networks uh i haven't worked
12:16 with myself directly but i i see a lot
12:19 of promise there
12:20 to sort of artificially sharpen low-res
12:22 images see some structure
12:24 any any any sort of task where you need
12:26 to scale things out and you're talking
12:28 about petabytes worth of data you need
12:29 to scale a lot of tasks out so it could
12:31 be you know a task where an astronomer
12:33 might be able to identify some some
12:36 artifact or something that's of interest
12:37 can that be scaled out and i think
12:39 that's i think that's called for machine
12:41 learning and deep learning so there's a
12:42 lot of promise there
12:45 i'm just wondering how the data looks
12:46 like is it not our usual
12:49 i don't know jpeg images with three
12:53 channels rgb it's something different
12:55 right
12:57 great question so yeah if you think
12:59 about even just an image right what is
13:00 an image well it's usually organized in
13:02 pixels or if you want to think of it as
13:04 a matrix you have cells of data and yeah
13:07 as you mentioned most images we're used
13:08 to have three channels red green and
13:11 blue
13:12 and if you just look at an image the
13:14 combination of those at a pixel level
13:16 will give you a lot of information
13:18 visually
13:19 if you were doing image analysis you
13:20 also know that looking at the histogram
13:22 of those channels is incredibly helpful
13:25 information
13:26 and seeing what the distribution of red
13:28 green and blue is well if you're
13:29 thinking about
13:30 hyperspectral imagery which is a which
13:32 is fairly common in earth observation
13:34 that i've been working in as well as
13:36 astronomy
13:37 you're looking across a number of
13:38 channels so it's hard for us as humans
13:41 to visualize something like that so
13:43 that's where your data visualization
13:45 takes on an importance and again you
13:46 might look at things like histograms um
13:49 or or other ways to sort of show uh that
13:52 data that that are not just sort of
13:54 image data
13:55 and that takes on a lot of importance
13:57 and then that might be something that
13:58 you're trying to optimize some machine
14:00 learning algorithm to look for patterns
14:02 in that sense
14:04 uh and so it's it's uh yeah i mean at
14:06 the end of the day they're really just
14:07 numerical matrices uh if you want to
14:09 think of it that way but the the amount
14:11 of information packed into these images
14:14 is pretty intense and don't forget time
14:17 is a factor here as well so
14:19 spatiotemporal images
14:21 are are a pretty big factor in astronomy
14:24 and this
14:25 hyperspectral image images
14:28 i hope i pronounce it correctly um so i
14:30 guess there are more than three channels
14:32 right so what are these channels usually
14:34 are yeah are there i don't know infrared
14:36 channels or
14:40 they they they certainly can be so when
14:42 i was in uh grad school we worked with a
14:44 camera that had 172 channels across
14:47 mostly the visible spectrum and a little
14:48 bit into the infrared so you're getting
14:50 into
14:50 uh you know eight to nine hundred
14:52 nanometers uh
14:54 the visible spectrum that we colors we
14:57 see are i think
14:58 something like 350 or 400 nanometers to
15:00 about 800 or something in that range
15:03 infrared then goes beyond that
15:05 um so you can you know if you have uh if
15:08 you know spatial resolution you can
15:10 think of a high-res image as having
15:12 pixels that represent a much much more
15:14 precise amount of information spatially
15:16 well you can also have that with with
15:18 spectral images so a red green and blue
15:22 uh resolute images is obviously not very
15:24 resolute you just have three general
15:26 channels uh if you have a high
15:28 hyperspectral camera you can divide that
15:30 electromagnetic spectrum which is
15:32 continuous of course
15:33 you can divide that into much much
15:35 smaller
15:37 segments in which case you have a lot
15:38 more information that you're looking at
15:40 just as you would with a high-res image
15:42 um and that certainly can extend into
15:45 the near mid or even long infrared and
15:47 that's actually fascinating for us in
15:49 astronomy because you know we're looking
15:51 and i'll get into this more later but
15:53 we're looking for water actually and
15:56 turns out if you understand the physics
15:57 of it that that hydroxyl bonds hydrogen
16:00 oxygen um absorb water at about three
16:03 microns which is way beyond what we can
16:05 see visually
16:08 and if you can look at the spectra of of
16:10 of an object that's got water in it
16:12 you'll see an absorption line or some
16:14 feature at about three microns and so
16:16 that's useful certainly for us if we're
16:18 looking at spectral signatures to say
16:19 hey there's potentially water in the
16:21 material that's reflecting sunlight that
16:23 we're looking at and that's useful
16:25 information and of course stellar
16:26 astronomers are interested in stars and
16:28 all kinds of things we're looking at
16:29 emission lines and
16:30 all manner of of information that you're
16:32 seeing across the spectrum
16:34 and certainly you know radio waves are
16:35 in the spectrum as well just they're
16:37 much larger uh way down the road but um
16:40 yeah it's
16:42 fascinating
16:44 so uh maybe we'll get to that a bit
16:47 later but from what i understood so
16:49 there is an object in space uh
16:52 like an asteroid and then it reflects
16:54 sun so there are
16:56 sun is shining on it right so there are
16:59 sun rays or exactly like the light is
17:01 there and then it reflects light so the
17:03 light goes towards the earth where we
17:05 capture the light
17:07 and different uh
17:09 different objects in space reflect
17:12 the light differently
17:13 and by how they reflect you can
17:17 make
17:18 you can understand what this thing is
17:20 made of right and if there is water
17:22 exactly if there is something else
17:25 absolutely absolutely yeah so
17:28 uh uh photometry is basically the
17:30 analysis of the the flux of of light of
17:34 photons that can help give you a sense
17:36 of brightness and potentially size but
17:38 if you think about size is important
17:41 because it's variable depending uh
17:43 anything but you could have a very small
17:45 but very bright object you could also
17:47 have an object that's very bright that's
17:48 very close to you uh or if it's very dim
17:51 is it far away or is it dim because it's
17:54 small or is it dim because it's just
17:56 darker material
17:58 you have to know these things so if
18:00 we're looking at asteroids it's really
18:02 really important for us to know where
18:03 that asteroid is meaning we have an
18:05 understanding of its orbit and if we
18:07 know where it is relative to us as the
18:10 observer and we know the angle of the
18:12 sun in us that gives us at least some
18:15 sort of constant and then if we look at
18:17 the brightness of the object we can
18:19 start to derive things like the size of
18:21 the object
18:22 as well as the reflectiveness of the
18:24 material of the object and that is also
18:27 you know because we don't know one of
18:29 those
18:30 for sure
18:31 there has to be uh you know some level
18:33 of estimation that goes into that and
18:36 that that that can be interesting you
18:37 also can see even
18:39 in some instances the rotational speed
18:42 of the asteroid as it's tumbling uh
18:44 based on the light curve if you look at
18:46 the changes in the light over a period
18:48 of time and now we're talking minutes or
18:49 hours really you can see that that light
18:52 curve and infer rotational speed and
18:54 potentially even shape the object
18:57 um the light the polarization of light
18:59 polarimetry uh is another potentially
19:02 under
19:02 estimated tool i think in terms of
19:04 understanding how the reflected light
19:06 can tell us about the shape of the
19:08 object uh so and of course spectroscopy
19:10 obviously if you're looking at what the
19:12 material is that's being reflected
19:15 and of course that doesn't necessarily
19:16 mean that's the material inside the
19:18 object
19:19 to do that you might want to look at
19:21 you know muons or magnetoscopes or all
19:24 kinds of interesting things that are
19:26 possible but potentially expensive so
19:28 we're not we're not necessarily doing
19:30 that right off the bat but those are
19:32 things that we might look at down the
19:33 road
19:34 so the features in this case are this
19:36 rotational speed like
19:38 how
19:39 light reflects from this uh from this
19:41 object also over time and all these
19:44 things polarization of light dimension
19:46 and then i guess
19:48 if we think about classical machine
19:50 learning so these are the features and
19:52 then the target is one if there is water
19:54 zero if there is no water
19:56 yeah
19:57 and i think
19:58 and there's another angle of this that's
20:00 that's also interesting from the machine
20:01 learning context so
20:03 when you're looking for water
20:05 you can't really look at it from a
20:07 telescope on the surface of the earth
20:09 and the reason is you have to look
20:10 through the atmosphere which as we know
20:12 is full of water so most of those
20:13 telescopes don't they don't even have a
20:15 filter at that wavelength uh and if they
20:17 did that you just see a bunch you just
20:18 see white noise uh so unfortunately
20:22 there's not a lot of data we can get in
20:23 the three micron range from earth
20:25 however we've noticed that there's a
20:27 high correlation
20:28 of features around
20:30 700 nanometers that may represent iron
20:33 oxides or something i i don't know off
20:35 the top of my head but there's a high
20:36 correlation of those with
20:38 uh water varying objects um
20:41 so there's a potential opportunity to
20:42 think about classifying an object based
20:44 on features of its spectral signature in
20:47 which case and its spectral signatures
20:49 sequential data similar to a time series
20:52 uh so you do have to be careful because
20:53 you're not looking at individual
20:55 dimensions that are independent as you
20:56 would maybe in other scenarios
20:58 and if you know about time series you
21:00 know that there's a lot you have to
21:01 think about in terms of how one um you
21:03 know one component relates to the
21:05 preceding and following components but
21:07 but if you do that to some degree you
21:09 can classify objects using spectral
21:11 signatures and that's a big area that
21:13 we're looking into because there is only
21:15 a small relative sample size of objects
21:18 that we have spectral signals signals
21:19 for and some of those are sparse and
21:22 depending on the object's location
21:24 relative to us they might look
21:25 differently so there's an opportunity
21:27 for us to sort of use machine learning
21:29 to help identify and classify those
21:30 patterns in a way that may be more
21:32 challenging for a human to do and can we
21:34 extrapolate that against objects that we
21:37 don't have spectral data for but we may
21:39 have other data on in terms of their
21:41 albedo or their or their even their
21:43 orbits will give us information about
21:45 where they're coming from so
21:47 pulling that all together and making
21:49 some inference around it is is a big
21:51 part of the job and i think
21:53 a lot of it can can be supplemented and
21:56 enhanced quite a bit by some machine
21:58 learning techniques
21:59 and where do the labels come from like
22:02 do you actually go there
22:04 uh and check if there's water or there
22:06 is a
22:07 way another great question so ground
22:09 truth right uh
22:11 very difficult to find in astronomy if
22:13 you're looking at objects that are
22:14 measured in uh uh you know millions of
22:18 kilometers is a pretty short distance
22:20 when you're in a domain that measures
22:22 things in light years um so yeah ground
22:26 truth is not something we have a lot of
22:27 but it's not zero we do have some so as
22:30 a matter of fact and some folks don't
22:31 know this
22:32 um the japanese space agency has sent a
22:34 couple missions the hayabusa missions
22:36 that have collected samples from from
22:38 asteroids recently an asteroid called
22:41 ryugu uh they brought back samples and
22:43 they published some analysis on that so
22:45 we've actually been able to look at
22:46 material they brought back from an
22:47 asteroid and it's really fascinating
22:49 because you can see you know the some
22:52 subtle differences in the material not
22:54 only from what we're looking at from
22:55 telescopes on the ground but even the
22:57 spacecraft itself that was hovering
22:59 around the asteroid for a couple weeks
23:02 and doing remote characterization work
23:04 you know there were even things that
23:05 that uh that that we're finding from the
23:07 sample that were slightly different than
23:09 what we'd anticipated there so there is
23:12 ground truth uh and there's also
23:14 osiris-rex is a nasa mission that's
23:16 returning and we'll get that sample
23:18 sometime later this year so there
23:20 actually is data that we can look at to
23:22 compare but a sample size of two three
23:25 is
23:25 pretty small
23:27 the other thing that we can actually
23:28 look at are meteorites
23:30 so meteorites are of course asteroids
23:33 that made it through
23:34 an impact impacted the earth
23:36 and there's a lot we can learn from that
23:38 and of course if you have a physical
23:40 sample and there are tens of thousands
23:41 of samples that we have so far you can
23:43 analyze that in any manner of ways with
23:46 uh very very intense laboratory
23:48 instruments and there's a lot of that
23:49 work that's been done and you can
23:51 potentially use that to extrapolate to
23:54 the families of asteroids that that we
23:56 think are out there
23:57 in space
23:58 we have to be aware of some very
23:59 important things like if it came through
24:01 the atmosphere that intense process has
24:04 changed the chemistry of that object or
24:06 potentially changed it so it's not a
24:08 direct comparison but there is some way
24:10 that you can look at that detailed data
24:12 in a meteorite and link it to asteroids
24:15 and we're actually now more people are
24:17 watching the skies we're able to in fact
24:19 see trajectories of meteorites as
24:22 they're entering the atmosphere and then
24:24 if we actually find that object because
24:26 we have videotaped we can actually see
24:28 its orbit and that gives us more
24:30 information about where this thing is
24:31 coming from
24:32 um so um yeah it's ground truth is very
24:35 difficult and this also you know a big
24:38 part of my job is really thinking about
24:39 how we can validate our models when we
24:42 are absent that information and so
24:44 de-biasing the models based on what
24:46 observational data we have is critical
24:48 um but you know you know candidly
24:51 understanding bias in our models is a
24:53 major challenge
24:54 we can find consistency
24:56 in terms of uh spectral classification
24:59 for example we may find a classifier
25:01 that
25:02 very consistently produces results and
25:04 results and then therefore reduces
25:05 variance well that's great but as many
25:08 know reducing variance uh is only okay
25:11 as long as you're not increasing bias or
25:13 if you're not paying attention to bias
25:14 um
25:15 we don't want to be more certain about
25:16 something that's wrong uh so that is a
25:20 not an easy not an easy thing to answer
25:22 but it is uh you know the the it's also
25:25 an emphasis why we're thinking about
25:27 cheap cheaper ways to send spacecraft to
25:30 analyze these objects to get more ground
25:32 truth data because that's really uh the
25:35 best way we think to understand these
25:37 mysterious beasts that we're after
25:42 yeah i'm
25:43 i think many of us are wondering now
25:46 like why
25:48 would you
25:49 care about water in asteroids like why
25:52 not i thought like when i first time
25:54 heard about what you do
25:56 i thought okay mine and asteroids you're
25:58 probably you probably want to extract
25:59 some precious metals and then sell it
26:01 here like on earth
26:03 yeah why water like we have a lot of
26:05 water on there
26:06 about this well very good question um
26:10 well water well scientifically water is
26:12 really really interesting water is so
26:14 important obviously to life and it may
26:17 contain other things that including
26:19 organic compounds or other things that
26:20 tell us about how the solar system is
26:22 generated but from from a commercial
26:24 standpoint
26:25 water is important for a concept that i
26:27 think is really important that not many
26:29 people have heard about which is in-situ
26:31 resource utilization or isru
26:33 and the idea with this concept is that
26:36 the space economy itself is it's real it
26:39 exists and it is growing so when we
26:41 think space we think um you know
26:44 satellites which are of course important
26:46 they if the satellites failed we would
26:49 our life would come to a halt the
26:50 infrastructure that they produce in
26:52 terms of communication and
26:53 infrastructure
26:54 internet is is immense among other
26:56 things so
26:58 these are starting to potentially crash
27:00 into each other figuring out how to
27:01 clear the debris how to service these
27:03 satellites this is becoming an industry
27:05 in and of itself that's incredibly
27:07 important
27:08 um but even related to that our idea is
27:09 how to refuel these satellites um
27:12 how to do more in manufacturing and
27:15 activities and research in space there
27:17 are currently i believe four
27:19 private space stations being planned in
27:21 the coming years they will be up there
27:23 as we know the international space
27:25 station's end of life is in the next few
27:27 years and there's not a there's no
27:28 government
27:29 plan to replace it uh so
27:32 all these commercial activities are are
27:35 in process and and manufacturing of
27:37 certain things fiber optic cables you
27:39 name it uh may benefit from low gravity
27:41 uh and not even to mention activity on
27:43 the moon or mars you know if we think
27:45 about as a species expanding
27:47 none of this happens without resources
27:50 resources that we currently have to
27:51 bring from the earth
27:53 and uh including water which is a
27:55 terrible cargo to to lift from the
27:58 ground it's heavy it takes up a lot of
28:00 space
28:02 rocket fuel is uh dependent on oxygen so
28:05 of course water can be
28:06 decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen
28:09 and i i don't know the exact numbers but
28:11 something like for every one part of
28:12 rocket fuel you need several parts of
28:14 oxygen so these rockets that are
28:16 launching are the weight a lot of it is
28:18 oxygen itself
28:20 if we can find a way to get water from
28:23 asteroids
28:24 that are actually pretty accessible in
28:26 terms of gravity
28:28 if we can find them and go to them the
28:30 delta v the change in velocity required
28:32 to do that maybe less so than even going
28:34 to the mood and coming back from the
28:36 surface of the moon just given gravity
28:38 then we think we have a viable option in
28:40 terms of finding water and bringing it
28:41 back uh i you know it costs several
28:44 thousand dollars to get a liter of water
28:46 up into orbit right now um
28:48 way more to get it beyond that and so if
28:50 we're able to bring that to the space
28:52 economy uh and deliver it to customers
28:55 who use it for various things
28:57 you know that's the that's the business
28:58 model we're working towards and of
29:00 course the long-term view is
29:02 certainly resources
29:04 writ large you know and if we if we come
29:06 up with the flywheel that it allows us
29:08 to find these asteroids bring back
29:10 material refine it and deliver it um and
29:13 we can do that scalably yes now we're
29:15 looking at other materials rare earth
29:17 elements precious metals um and and
29:20 there's something that we can think
29:21 about there uh it's yeah the sensation
29:23 is oh we're gonna find an asteroid full
29:25 of platinum yeah i
29:27 that certainly they certainly have those
29:29 resources we believe um
29:31 most of the material we're digging up in
29:33 the earth's crust came from asteroids we
29:35 also believe uh uh or at least that's a
29:37 heavy source of that um but there are
29:40 you know i think the infrastructure has
29:41 to be in place there has to be an
29:43 ability to actually sustainably get that
29:45 stuff
29:46 um not to mention how you would bring
29:48 that back to earth i mean there's a big
29:49 big challenges and then even the
29:51 economics of it you know what's the cost
29:53 of platinum now versus what it'll be in
29:54 15 years
29:56 i don't know it's a good question i know
29:58 diesel engines are a big driver of
29:59 platinum are we going to be driving
30:01 diesel engines as much
30:02 maybe maybe not so there's a there's
30:04 sort of an economics question there that
30:06 we don't want to have to tackle if we
30:08 know that there's an immediate need for
30:10 certain resources like water that are
30:12 more attractive to customers that
30:14 currently exist actually and so that's
30:16 kind of our focus
30:18 what else can you find on asteroids so
30:20 you mentioned platinum but i think it
30:22 was a good example of
30:24 a an expensive thing on nerf
30:26 that
30:28 you know potentially you can sell but
30:30 it's just too difficult to extract but
30:32 what is there as well in addition to
30:34 water that could be
30:36 immediately useful
30:38 yeah i mean
30:39 the um
30:42 that there's a lot of unknowns there and
30:44 i think that's the the big question is
30:45 what what materials uh really are
30:48 available
30:49 there this isn't an asteroid that we're
30:51 going to go after it's it's in the main
30:53 belt so it's too far away for us but
30:55 psyche uh is um and there's a mission
30:58 that's going after psyche which we
30:59 believe is a uh
31:01 potentially a planetesimal core might be
31:03 the core of a of a sm of a of a planet
31:06 or planetesimal object where the rocky
31:08 layer was was smashed away um and it's
31:13 full of metal all right so iron all
31:15 kinds of metal that you can think of
31:17 and there may be other asteroids that
31:19 are you know components of that so any
31:21 type of metal uh that you're interested
31:23 including precious metals uh are
31:25 certainly to be found there um from a
31:28 scientific perspective the idea of
31:29 organic compounds is pretty intriguing
31:31 you know you can think of these
31:32 asteroids as essentially fossil records
31:34 of the solar system they're essentially
31:36 as old as the solar system but unlike
31:38 the earth and other planets they have
31:40 not been um
31:41 well they've experienced some space
31:43 weathering and collisions and other
31:45 things but they're they're probably more
31:46 of a pure record of of compounds um
31:50 that is more of a scientific value than
31:52 anything else but yeah i think uh rare
31:54 earth elements and precious metals which
31:56 are all things that were excavating from
31:58 the earth excavating from the earth
31:59 right now are um assumed to be embedded
32:02 in these objects but we just don't know
32:05 for sure so that's some that's part of
32:07 the part of the
32:08 you know part of the impetus to us going
32:10 and finding out
32:12 where do these asteroids come from like
32:14 do they just appear and then you see
32:16 them and you think okay we are going to
32:18 mine that one
32:20 uh
32:21 yeah one of the first things we did is
32:23 we will hire a planetary scientist an
32:25 astronomer uh and one of the reasons we
32:27 did is he's been working with uh the
32:29 modeling that answers that question so
32:32 most people i think are familiar with
32:34 the main belt of asteroids so it's
32:35 beyond mars and there are a lot of
32:38 theories about you know the the source
32:40 of the material was it a planet that was
32:42 broken up is it just sort of a
32:43 collection of
32:44 of of stuff if you think about the solar
32:46 system being a sort of chaos for much of
32:49 its early state that eventually as
32:51 things uh you know collected into
32:53 planets and they found their groove i
32:56 love to think about the solar system in
32:57 terms of resonances you know
33:00 everything is just sort of resonating
33:01 and as the planets are going around
33:03 they're creating these resonance
33:04 patterns which are critically important
33:06 for us so jupiter is a
33:08 massive animal and as it's revolving
33:10 around the sun it's creating resonances
33:12 with the other planets
33:14 every so often this asteroid belt you
33:16 know there may be a collision or
33:17 something or maybe some something will
33:19 get perturbed but an asteroid will will
33:21 get thrown into an area of resonance
33:24 where because of the gravity of the
33:26 planets it will basically kind of
33:28 continue to shape the orbit of this
33:30 asteroid such that it'll bring it into a
33:33 near-earth orbit
33:35 so when we're looking at near-earth
33:37 asteroids our assumption is that their
33:39 original source was from elsewhere in
33:41 the solar system uh the main belt or
33:43 even beyond that in the outer regions um
33:46 there's a region around
33:48 jupiter that that the trojans uh based
33:51 on um lagrange points there may be a
33:54 collection of items there
33:56 that we think for some reason or other
33:57 were thrown into the
33:59 into the near space we think there may
34:01 be three to four hundred million
34:02 asteroids in the near earth space uh
34:05 ranging to very small unless people get
34:07 concerned about that but
34:09 uh but we think the source of those is
34:10 all coming from the from the main belt
34:12 and so our modeling is is basically
34:14 trying to understand those gravitational
34:16 dynamics uh and there are other dynamics
34:18 too this solar wind is a dynamic to to
34:21 pay attention to
34:22 uh and and collisions of other asteroids
34:24 of course uh but we think that's
34:26 actually the source and um you know
34:29 nasa's jpl has cataloged something like
34:31 29 000 near-earth asteroids um
34:34 we so if we think there are 300 to 400
34:37 million of them we're only scratching
34:39 the surface um
34:41 thankfully i think most people should
34:42 feel assured that anything that's large
34:44 enough to maybe do any damage we've
34:46 mostly seen those there is a pretty
34:48 intense effort to document more of those
34:51 um so most of these are fairly small
34:53 objects but um but yeah finding them
34:56 exactly uh statistical modeling is
34:58 really helpful for us but as i like to
35:00 tell our team i mean we're not able to
35:01 statistically mine an asteroid uh so we
35:04 do need to find an actual uh anomaly uh
35:07 that we can that we can that we can get
35:09 so uh yeah it's it's we think
35:12 probabilistically and i think we're
35:13 comfortable with that and that helps us
35:15 i think make choices and decisions about
35:17 where we're sending spacecraft and what
35:19 we're going to find when we get there
35:20 but the real question is what are we
35:22 going to find is it going to be there
35:24 what is it going to be so
35:26 we'll have to start with a sample of
35:27 asteroids that we have observed and that
35:29 we do have some information on that's
35:31 probably the easiest way to do this um
35:34 but there's hopefully going to be
35:36 in the near future you know more
35:38 telescopes we know of a couple that are
35:39 going to be coming online
35:41 that will be able to see a lot more of
35:42 these objects
35:44 and that'll be very useful for everybody
35:46 including ourselves
35:48 so as i understood your business model
35:51 is
35:52 so there is
35:53 there is this main belt of asteroid
35:55 asteroids right and then jupiter passes
35:57 by and then it pushes some of the
35:59 asteroids towards the earth so you want
36:02 to detect it on this asteroid that is
36:04 coming towards
36:06 us right or somewhere in the uh
36:08 that process that i described that can
36:10 happen over many probably millions of
36:12 years so we're okay astronomy are much
36:14 larger so we're looking at the asteroids
36:16 that that's already happened to so
36:18 they're already here they're in the
36:19 neighborhood
36:20 now if you think about the earth going
36:22 around the sun and it's following an
36:23 orbit uh you know a certain velocity
36:26 finds a groove like in a record groove
36:28 where it's going around um there's no
36:31 you know we have reason to believe
36:32 there's a lot of other asteroids that
36:34 are also in that same groove and they're
36:36 going around the sun in that orbit um we
36:40 don't see them because
36:42 it's you know we're on the surface of an
36:44 earth and so if you think about if you
36:45 can visualize the orbit coming around
36:47 the earth if you were to look at an
36:49 object that's on the line of that orbit
36:50 that means you're looking at an object
36:52 that is you know you got the sun right
36:55 here so in order to see that object if
36:57 you're looking at it dead on it's going
36:59 to have to be during dusk or dawn and
37:02 the light conditions are not good for
37:03 seeing faint objects or if you're
37:05 looking in the middle of the night when
37:07 it's a lot darker you're going to have
37:09 to look really near the horizon in order
37:11 to just because of the angles
37:13 and then of course you're looking
37:14 through a much larger column of air and
37:16 that's also not great for when you're
37:18 trying to find things so it's hard to
37:20 see these objects but
37:22 but for gravitational reasons we think
37:25 that there's a lot of them in that orbit
37:27 um going around the earth and most of
37:29 the things that end up making it to
37:31 earth were probably in the sort of
37:32 debris pile kind of floating around so i
37:35 think the question is not necessarily
37:36 that we're looking at asteroids coming
37:38 to us from the main belt that we're
37:40 looking for asteroids that are already
37:42 here
37:43 um it's helpful for us to look at the
37:44 main belt to understand those asteroids
37:47 what they're made out of
37:48 because a lot of them are larger we have
37:50 more data on that and because we
37:52 theorize that a lot of the smaller
37:54 asteroids are just fragments or pieces
37:55 of the larger ones
37:57 if we know about the larger ones that
37:59 are in the main belt can we extrapolate
38:01 what we think the smaller ones in the
38:03 nearest space are
38:05 that's maybe an open hypothesis in some
38:08 senses but that's the working hypothesis
38:10 that we're dealing with
38:13 yeah and i assume to do that to be able
38:15 to do all that you don't just keep your
38:18 data in excel spreadsheets and analyze
38:20 there so you need to collect store
38:22 process all this data
38:24 yeah
38:25 we are actually talking about a data
38:28 department right a team a team who does
38:31 all that so can we talk about that a
38:33 little bit so how does your data team
38:35 look like who are there in the team and
38:38 what do they do
38:39 yeah so you know we're we're uh we're
38:42 just starting out so we're young small
38:43 team
38:44 and act people actively working with the
38:46 data we have two research scientists one
38:48 as i mentioned is an astronomer
38:50 planetary scientist focusing on asteroid
38:52 characterization so where are these what
38:54 do they look like um and then we have
38:57 another uh research scientist who's a
38:58 well she's a mission design specialist
39:00 and as an engineer she's thinking about
39:02 the spacecraft mission that we will need
39:05 to help develop to actually access these
39:08 um uh and
39:10 and then myself of course um looking at
39:12 the data modeling uh overall um one of
39:15 the reasons we're looking to we are
39:17 looking to hire a data engineer is
39:18 because uh i've been at many
39:20 organizations where i've lamented that
39:21 we didn't put enough emphasis on data
39:23 engineering
39:24 that should really be one of the first
39:25 data team members hired and so i'm in a
39:27 position now to to do something about
39:29 that so we are looking to bring someone
39:32 we have um um we have somebody who's
39:34 helping us with with some
39:35 really important work but we're we're
39:37 still open for for interested folks
39:40 and i think this person hopefully will
39:42 help us think about the architecture and
39:44 the vision of how we're doing this so
39:46 um there is a lot of data that exists
39:49 uh some of it is in catalogs um the
39:51 minor planet center uh you know nasa jpl
39:54 esa the european space agency there's a
39:56 lot of public agencies that have done an
39:58 incredible job
40:00 organizing this data doing even some
40:02 derived uh
40:03 attributes including orbit determination
40:05 and other characteristics
40:07 excuse me um but uh it still is a field
40:11 of a lot of specialists you know so you
40:13 have astronomers who are focusing on one
40:15 component of of astronomy and they're
40:18 working with data related to that um in
40:20 a contrast with say earth observation
40:22 which is the world that i was in before
40:25 that has you've seen a market explode in
40:28 terms of consumers of the data which has
40:30 helped make a lot of that data a little
40:31 bit more usable more analysis ready if
40:34 you will i haven't seen that in the
40:35 astronomical community yet not that
40:37 there's not a lot of open collaboration
40:39 but um a lot of the data that is
40:41 provided is in fairly
40:44 complicated file structures produced by
40:46 fairly complicated processes as i've
40:48 mentioned before
40:49 and if we're going to look at analyzing
40:51 things across these platforms there's a
40:54 real need for for some folks who are
40:56 used to working with data in in more
40:58 complicated file structures obviously
41:00 image data is a pretty big part of that
41:02 but there's a lot of catalog data where
41:04 um you know the statistics of images and
41:06 other um
41:08 and other detectors has been
41:10 pretty um
41:11 methodically and comprehensively laid
41:13 out in table uh so
41:16 uh table data so thinking about the
41:17 architecture of how this comes together
41:18 and how we can have a really big view i
41:21 mean we're building a bayesian engine
41:22 really and the more information we can
41:25 get helps improve our understanding of
41:27 of the asteroids that we're looking at
41:29 uh and all the pipelines related to that
41:32 you know the analytical pipelines
41:33 related to getting that data and being
41:35 able to analyze it
41:37 as well as of course the infrastructure
41:38 to support the machine learning modeling
41:40 that we're going to need to be doing and
41:41 already have started uh it's all part of
41:44 that so i guess the answer to your
41:46 question is the data team is is in a
41:48 future tense right now uh and that's
41:50 what i'm hoping to change very very
41:51 quickly um i mean we're all working with
41:53 data but someone who's really focused on
41:55 helping us build the uh you know build
41:58 the pipelines for that
41:59 and uh
42:01 is our website and we have a job posting
42:03 there so obviously i'll make a pitch for
42:06 people who are interested uh as data
42:07 engineers we'll also be looking for data
42:09 scientists and machine learning
42:10 engineers in the future for sure um and
42:13 so i opened any everyone interested
42:16 please you know let me know i'll give
42:17 you my contact info but um but data
42:20 engineering specifically is the key
42:21 focus okay i'll make sure to include the
42:24 link to the description
42:25 and uh
42:27 i was wondering like do you use cloud
42:30 because i think cloud here may
42:32 so i think uh the uh uh you know where
42:35 we're um we'll probably be set up in aws
42:38 ecosystem um i've used google cloud
42:42 i'm not as familiar with with microsoft
42:44 um
42:45 but um
42:46 yeah we are going to be uh i want to say
42:49 as close to cloud native as possible
42:50 we'll probably still be doing some
42:52 prototyping locally
42:53 uh it's just it's easier to kind of play
42:56 around with some of the exploratory
42:57 stuff but um no the big emphasis is in
43:00 cloud for many many good reasons we
43:02 don't want to have to do infrastructure
43:03 that we don't need to do
43:04 we don't we don't want to have to deal
43:06 with the security infosec issues that
43:08 that are going to be very important to
43:10 understand and so if we're able to use
43:12 um you know the infrastructure that is
43:14 provided by a service company like that
43:16 um that's very useful on that on the
43:19 other hand we need people and we'll need
43:21 devops and our cloud architects who can
43:22 help us when we're implementing make
43:24 sure that this is set up correctly and
43:26 that we're doing this
43:27 especially when you're dealing with
43:28 image data which is similar to the earth
43:30 observation scenario um sort of
43:32 scientific mindset that i've seen at
43:34 least in astronomy is you're doing some
43:36 kind of analysis you download all the
43:38 data you might potentially need locally
43:40 so
43:40 that's a massive amount of data takes
43:43 forever and now you're in the data
43:44 management business on your laptop or
43:46 your computer if if even you can do that
43:48 unless you're lucky enough to have
43:49 access to a high-powered computing
43:51 cluster
43:52 you're going to have to be doing some
43:53 kind of analysis with that
43:55 or if that data's in the cloud then you
43:57 still have communication costs where
43:58 you're having to move that data when you
44:00 need it
44:02 i think cloud optimized geotips in the
44:04 earth observation domain are incredibly
44:06 useful i think watch for that to grow
44:09 uh and stack the spatial temporal asset
44:11 catalog convention
44:13 makes it a lot more usable user friendly
44:15 for analysts to query certain tiles of
44:18 satellite data without having to
44:20 download the whole file and that way
44:22 they can do analysis in a much more
44:24 precise manner i have not seen anything
44:26 like that in the astronomical community
44:28 yet um
44:29 and so
44:30 and maybe the the incentive isn't there
44:32 but the ability to
44:34 uh query some of these dense files as
44:36 opposed to having to process this in a
44:38 server where the where the images are
44:40 cut to spec by some user in a process
44:43 that's queued up and then may take you
44:45 know quite some time and also puts a
44:47 pretty big burden on the data provider
44:50 or you download all this information do
44:52 it yourself which is a challenge too um
44:55 so i think
44:56 i hopefully will see more conventions
44:58 like cogs and stack take off in this
45:01 astronomical community but but for our
45:04 perspective as a company absolutely
45:06 cloud cloud infrastructure is is
45:08 critical
45:09 yeah i was just going to make a silly
45:11 joke about like you know cloud is closer
45:13 to the asteroids because it's in the sky
45:16 and then i took it off and i rambled on
45:17 the whole thing yeah
45:20 okay i see that they're good for
45:21 computing but they're terrible for
45:23 astronomy yeah it's uh
45:26 we have
45:27 quite a few questions so the first
45:28 question is uh are there open data sets
45:32 that are interesting to explore as a
45:33 hobbyist and actually the question is
45:36 asking specifically about tabular data
45:38 sets but maybe we can
45:40 talk about data sets in general
45:42 absolutely so i mentioned the minor
45:44 planet center
45:45 and i can send you a link or how to
45:47 spell this or anything but it's
45:50 minorplanetcenter.net and they have what
45:52 i believe is probably the database of
45:54 record of asteroids and comets too
45:57 and so if there's a an observation
45:59 that's reported it
46:00 that's the place that people report it
46:02 to so in its tabular data so they have
46:06 records of all the asteroids that we
46:07 know of there's over a million of them
46:09 um and including as i mentioned the
46:11 nearest asteroids of which there's about
46:13 thirty thousand um
46:15 and then there's some attributes based
46:16 on the orbital elements that we know
46:18 from those objects as well as uh the
46:21 brightness absolute magnitude um and
46:24 there's also um an archive of all the
46:27 observations right so some of these
46:28 asteroids we have observations going
46:29 back to the 1800s
46:32 and those are being updated you know
46:34 hourly every day there's people finding
46:36 more observations in these topics so if
46:38 you're interested in just kind of taking
46:39 a look at that and there's if you're if
46:41 you tool around in python which is a
46:42 popular language for astronomers because
46:44 of the open source nature there are even
46:46 a number of packages um
46:48 um that are developed and i'll follow up
46:51 with you alexi just to link some some of
46:53 these but there's packages that allow
46:55 you to query the minor planet center and
46:57 then you can even propagate orbits and
46:58 you can do all kinds of interesting
47:00 stuff uh with them um if you're
47:02 interested in digging into the data
47:03 itself um the the the neo-wise so
47:06 there's a satellite the wise um uh why
47:10 is wide infrared survey i forget what it
47:13 stands for exactly there's some uh um it
47:16 was a satellite platform that has
47:19 infrared um uh bands uh that it's
47:22 capturing and the it was reactivated
47:25 several years ago to actually look for
47:27 near-earth objects so the neo-wise data
47:29 set
47:30 is cataloged in something called the uh
47:32 irsa the uh
47:34 um i forgot what that stands for
47:36 infrared something catalog i'll send
47:39 these links but yes
47:41 image data would be much easier all data
47:43 if you're if you want to go and sort of
47:44 query you know the source table uh for
47:48 single exposures of of known objects not
47:51 just asteroids but a lot of other stuff
47:53 too um that's a pretty fun catalog to
47:55 play around with um
47:57 boy there's a lot i could spend a lot of
47:58 time doing that but um but yeah i would
48:01 start with the minor planet center if
48:02 you're sort of interested in
48:03 understanding specifically asteroids and
48:06 just kind of getting a feel for it
48:08 the jpl jet propulsion laboratory
48:10 horizons system
48:13 they've set up they've recently spun up
48:15 a few apis that make interacting with
48:16 that data very useful
48:18 and so they also are providing
48:20 additional information uh including a
48:22 diameter or maybe some other attributes
48:24 that they're deriving about these
48:25 asteroids their source data largely is
48:27 still the minor planet center but uh
48:29 they also there's additional information
48:32 you can get that people have provided
48:33 and uh again they have a nice api and
48:36 it's very well documented and i know
48:38 they put a lot of work into that the
48:39 solar system dynamics group at jpl
48:42 did a tremendous job pulling a lot of
48:44 stuff together there
48:46 i also know that topcoder this is a
48:48 website uh one of the things they do is
48:51 also hosts data science competitions
48:54 and
48:55 lately
48:56 recently like maybe two three months ago
48:58 they hosted two competitions from
49:01 nasa
49:02 so they
49:04 i think both were related to asteroids
49:06 ah also check that out check it out yeah
49:08 so maybe you just look up uh top coder
49:11 and asa competitions and yeah yeah i
49:13 think you'll find uh some stuff there
49:15 yeah and there's you know if you're
49:17 interested in getting into some of the
49:18 more interesting machine learning stuff
49:19 i mean tracking
49:21 orbit determination is a challenge if
49:23 you think about looking at observations
49:25 of an object over time being able to
49:27 link them
49:28 uh together and say well these aren't
49:30 separate objects these are the same
49:31 objects i'm seeing and not only is it
49:33 the same object but i can now determine
49:35 what its orbit is uh the process of
49:37 linking those is is uh
49:39 you know traditionally you need several
49:42 observations and you can verify it's the
49:44 same object but
49:45 um there are you know synthetic tracking
49:47 techniques there are things that people
49:48 are looking at and exploring where
49:50 you're basically shifting images in
49:52 different directions and different
49:53 magnitudes and trying to see if you can
49:55 identify objects that have shifted in a
49:57 consistent way that indicates that
49:59 they're moving in a direction um and
50:01 being and as you can imagine doing that
50:03 over the scale of many many many
50:04 millions or even billions of images is
50:07 not a human problem that's a machine
50:08 problem uh so there's a lot of things
50:10 that i think are pretty interesting in
50:11 that whole arena there are a lot of
50:13 astronomers and uh
50:15 you know scientific researchers who are
50:18 doing elements of this so the nice thing
50:20 about the scientific community is if
50:22 we're interested in playing around with
50:23 this data you know google scholar
50:25 find out put in some terms and see what
50:27 what's being done and um i personally
50:30 find it fascinating to look up papers of
50:32 things that people have done and try to
50:33 replicate their methods
50:35 and and then
50:37 you try to experiment with maybe some
50:38 more you know enhanced probabilistic
50:41 models or throw in some some interesting
50:43 ways to do what they did and see if that
50:46 that changes anything and uh i i mean
50:48 that's a great place to start and if you
50:50 find anything let me know maybe we'll
50:51 hire you
50:53 you also mentioned that one of the
50:55 person
50:56 on your team is
50:59 taking care of mission design yes and
51:02 there is a question from matt is
51:04 matt how do you plan to interact with
51:07 the folks going to get the asteroids is
51:09 it actually are you going to do this
51:11 yourself like the person who is doing
51:13 the mission design going to come up with
51:16 a rocket or you're going to partner with
51:18 somebody or what are the options there
51:20 yeah that's a very good question and so
51:22 thankfully there has been such an
51:24 interest in space activity in general
51:26 that there are
51:27 quite a few commercial companies uh in
51:30 addition to the public agencies
51:32 uh that are building spacecraft um so we
51:35 know famous examples like spacex blue
51:37 origin that are launching uh building
51:39 rockets that are launching things into
51:41 space uh and they're doing other things
51:43 as well uh but there's a whole ecosystem
51:45 of companies that are building uh we're
51:47 pretty interested in cubesats right so
51:49 they're
51:50 usually fairly small satellites uh and
51:53 those are being deployed to do a number
51:55 of different things but uh everything
51:57 from the instrumentation to the
51:58 propulsion to the computing systems
52:01 there's a lot of companies that are
52:02 assembling and building that so we don't
52:04 find that we're going to need to build
52:05 anything ourselves in the sense that we
52:08 don't want to be in the business of
52:09 creating hardware um but we would
52:12 certainly want to work with suppliers
52:13 and vendors who are
52:15 what we need to do is set up our mission
52:17 profile so that we understand what what
52:20 it is that we need to develop some
52:22 things will be off the shelf right so
52:23 cots commercial off the shelf
52:25 technology is our philosophy as much as
52:28 we can use that it's cheaper flexible
52:31 there's probably a lot you could do by
52:32 you know flying your cell phone through
52:34 space um but there's certain things
52:37 especially related to the idea of
52:38 actually extracting material from an
52:40 object uh
52:42 we have some you know certainly some
52:43 very smart people at jaxa nasa and esa
52:47 who have done that and we want to learn
52:49 from them as much as we can
52:51 but there's also some aspects that we're
52:53 going to have to r d ourselves and we're
52:55 working with a couple research
52:56 universities to do just that uh and
52:58 develop that but yeah in general if it
53:01 exists and there's somebody making
53:03 something or doing something that we can
53:05 partner with or use
53:06 that's our preference and then that
53:08 since we're developing you know the
53:10 architecture for the mission that's
53:12 needed
53:13 and if we have to we'll look at
53:14 developing ourselves but um but that's
53:17 the
53:17 uh you know
53:19 that's that's the idea
53:21 and this mission would not only involve
53:24 like uh
53:25 thinking how to get there to the
53:26 asteroid but also how to actually drill
53:28 the hole in the asteroid absolutely the
53:30 water right yeah and i would and i would
53:32 say that really for most of what we're
53:33 looking at uh
53:35 drilling is is a problematic way to look
53:38 at it because you don't have really
53:39 gravity and you also don't have a very
53:41 solid material that you're drilling into
53:44 uh you really need to think of a lot of
53:46 these asteroids as being rubble pots uh
53:48 so if if you're if any of you are
53:50 familiar with uh
53:51 mcdonald's restaurants at least in the
53:53 u.s they used to have ball pits where
53:55 you have just these plastic balls you
53:57 could jump in and play around
53:59 you might need to think of these
54:00 asteroids as being somewhat like that so
54:03 it's
54:03 it's uh it would be more of a matter of
54:06 scooping or scraping or somehow
54:09 collecting that material but that's a
54:10 major engineering challenge uh it's
54:12 something that we're really trying to
54:14 think about maybe we'll find a larger
54:15 boulder that will pluck i don't know
54:17 there's a lot of things that we're
54:18 looking at um that are related to that
54:20 um but yeah that's that's part of this
54:23 uh overall r d processes how we get the
54:25 material and return it it's a it's a
54:28 major
54:29 that's a major challenge
54:30 yeah because i guess you cannot just you
54:32 know uh travel there with a ship and
54:35 then
54:36 tractor use tractor beamer to pull it
54:39 we're not there yet alexi i would like
54:41 to think that we can be and uh
54:43 and if we are doing our job to build
54:45 space infrastructure you know god
54:47 willing we'll be doing things like that
54:48 at some point the future
54:52 so what century is uh spice trek uh
54:55 set up uh
54:57 our 24th century first okay we still got
55:00 time right
55:02 yeah we got some time we got some time
55:04 um
55:05 yeah uh you know warp engines is a big
55:08 one i don't know if we're we're already
55:09 behind the ball on that one i think uh
55:11 um
55:12 if i'm not mistaken we're not we're only
55:14 a couple decades from needing to
55:15 actually pioneer some early space flight
55:17 according to star trek lore so we got to
55:20 get on it
55:22 yeah there is the comment from danielle
55:24 that interesting conversation i'm an
55:27 astronomer currently researching on
55:29 multi-wavelength counterpart
55:33 like there are some words i don't
55:34 understand and uh good to know that
55:36 there is a business case for asteroids
55:38 so this is uh absolutely yeah i mean one
55:40 of the things that i find really most
55:42 satisfying about this work is that there
55:44 are so many people uh including the
55:46 people we've hired who are really
55:48 interested in putting their skills to
55:49 use uh and and not not to deride other
55:52 domains you know if you're looking at
55:54 you know energy trading or other things
55:56 that are very very quantitative fields
55:58 but sometimes people that i've spoken to
56:00 have found that their skill sets in
56:02 working with derivatives or doing this
56:04 modeling um
56:06 aren't they don't have a home in the
56:07 sort of applied science area so they
56:09 apply them in other areas well hopefully
56:11 we can be a home for people that are
56:12 looking to put their skills to use in
56:15 astrophysics and scientific computing
56:17 looking at some of these challenges
56:19 because it's a need that we have for
56:20 sure
56:22 and then i don't know if the name new
56:25 light technologies incorporated tell you
56:27 anything yeah
56:30 i know he was going to join but yeah i
56:32 used to work for new light technologies
56:33 great very smart wonderful people yeah
56:36 yeah so
56:37 they ask if you have a partner program
56:41 in the
56:42 works question uh we should talk about
56:45 that yeah we we obviously are doing a
56:47 lot of collaborations uh at this point
56:49 mostly with research universities and
56:50 there's a couple commercial uh
56:52 organizations that we're partnering with
56:54 in terms of uh mission design um
56:56 [Music]
56:58 new light i'll make a pitch i mean you
56:59 have a lot of really incredible devops
57:01 uh and data engineers and some folks
57:02 that are really used to working with uh
57:05 enterprise uh data um
57:08 you know data modeling so uh yeah let's
57:10 talk uh there may be an opportunity
57:12 there
57:14 okay
57:15 so i'm just trying to see now because
57:18 there are quite a few things we didn't
57:20 cover i'm just checking
57:24 what else we missed
57:27 uh yeah so the this interesting one what
57:29 kind of mathematical models do you build
57:32 i remember we talked a bit about that uh
57:34 before before this
57:36 yeah yeah
57:37 yeah so you know i mentioned i would say
57:39 our overall approach to understanding
57:40 asteroids is taking on the form of a
57:43 sort of asian engine of source that's a
57:44 very general kind of way to describe it
57:46 but i i think you know when we try to
57:48 when we're trying to understand how
57:50 each additional piece of data or new
57:53 method that we use to improve
57:55 whether we're trying to understand the
57:56 albedo the reflective nature of these
57:58 asteroids or their orbital elements or
58:01 the spectral classification there might
58:03 be independent models that we're using
58:04 to derive that
58:07 um but overall we want to be able to
58:08 understand well how how
58:10 how does each new piece of information
58:11 affect our overall understanding of this
58:13 and then sort of the bayesian framework
58:15 is really well suited for that and so
58:17 that can also help us quantify things a
58:19 little bit more in terms of the
58:20 individual model excuse me you know some
58:22 things are simple so if you look at the
58:24 size frequency distribution of asteroids
58:26 it generally seems to follow a power law
58:28 pretty closely so with uh basic
58:30 polynomial linear regression you can you
58:32 can model the size frequency
58:34 distribution uh
58:36 fairly well um other things like looking
58:39 at um you know albedo for example are
58:41 more complicated because you're looking
58:43 at sunlight being radiated from a from a
58:45 body that is not necessarily a sphere so
58:47 thermal models that are being used to do
58:49 that and there's certainly folks uh that
58:52 are doing that research and thinking
58:53 about that but um you know some some
58:55 things there are getting more complex uh
58:57 people don't know this there's something
58:58 called the yarkovsky effect which is
59:00 essentially that the actual
59:03 energy from radiating
59:04 uh the radiation from uh thermal
59:07 radiation from an asteroid based on
59:09 reflected sunlight is enough to actually
59:11 push that asteroid
59:13 over the course of many years of course
59:14 but if it's a small enough asteroid
59:16 that's a meaningful uh force that's
59:18 being pushed on that asteroid so and how
59:21 the asteroid's rotating and what its
59:22 surface looks like has a lot to do with
59:24 that um
59:26 i you know i touched on a couple you
59:28 know some deep learning and machine
59:29 learning techniques certainly in terms
59:31 of vision and object detection but
59:34 spectral
59:35 analysis is really really big uh it's
59:38 going to be very important for us and
59:39 trying to understand the composition of
59:40 these and as i mentioned there's just
59:42 not a lot of observed data so we're
59:44 really going to need to think about
59:45 where we can um extrapolate the known
59:48 data uh and apply to
59:51 objects that we may know something about
59:53 but we don't know their spectroscopy for
59:54 example uh and so there's there's
59:56 certainly some modeling that's going to
59:58 need to go into that but
1:00:00 yeah it's we're dealing in probabilities
1:00:02 here so a lot of it is just how we can
1:00:05 define those probabilities in ways that
1:00:06 make enough sense for us to make
1:00:08 decisions name of the game right
1:00:10 yeah i prepared another joke for you
1:00:12 another silly joke about jupiter
1:00:14 notebooks
1:00:18 jupiter yeah uh it takes a different
1:00:20 meaning when you're using jupiter
1:00:21 notebooks to sort of model jupiter
1:00:23 orbits right um uh
1:00:26 yeah yeah uh well i don't know if you
1:00:28 have a joke there i mean jupiter i use
1:00:30 notebooks they're useful for
1:00:32 uh telling the story of data i don't
1:00:34 develop in them because i think it
1:00:36 teaches bad habits for developers but uh
1:00:39 myself included so uh but uh
1:00:42 yeah it takes on a little different
1:00:44 meaning
1:00:45 yeah yeah i think we should be wrapping
1:00:47 up um so thanks a lot for joining us
1:00:50 today for sharing your
1:00:52 expertise also a couple of stories for
1:00:55 sharing all that that he shared with us
1:00:56 today thanks everyone else for joining
1:00:59 us today for watching us for asking
1:01:01 questions
1:01:02 and
1:01:03 yeah i guess you will give
1:01:05 me some links i will post them in the
1:01:07 description yeah i'll do that yeah
1:01:08 definitely including my uh you know dot
1:01:11 dot
1:01:12 d crawl d dot c r u l l at
1:01:14 carmenplus.com and um i'll send you
1:01:16 links but yeah i certainly if you're
1:01:18 doing research in this area um i want to
1:01:21 talk to you um and as we're growing our
1:01:23 team you know there's a lot of areas
1:01:25 there and certainly we're looking for
1:01:26 data engineers i mentioned we'll be
1:01:27 looking for some other data focused
1:01:29 folks uh for sure but um let's uh hey
1:01:32 let's talk see what happens
1:01:35 yeah thanks a lot yeah thanks a lot have
1:01:37 a great weekend
1:01:38 you too goodbye
