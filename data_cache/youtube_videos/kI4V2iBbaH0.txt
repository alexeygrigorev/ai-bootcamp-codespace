2:36 it's very nice to see you again and
2:40 working together with you for another
2:42 podcast
2:43 yeah and well a brief introduction about
2:45 my background how did i get into data
2:48 right i i was studying in the states
2:50 with a
2:51 undergrad degree of business and then
2:54 carrying that i worked one year in
2:56 silicon valley bay area where i really
2:58 get into
3:00 i get to know a lot of people who work
3:01 for
3:02 big tech companies they talk about data
3:04 technology ai
3:06 and i see the sparkle in their eyes how
3:08 passionate they are about their job
3:11 i that got really got me intrigued and
3:13 after reading some books research that
3:16 landed me to spain barcelona
3:19 to do my master in big data so from
3:21 there on my data's career started i
3:24 first
3:25 worked with a spanish unicorn global
3:29 it's like a delivery company almost like
3:32 ubereat
3:33 and
3:34 with a company growing i was dedicating
3:36 into
3:37 analytics to support different
3:39 departments
3:40 then from there on
3:42 i joined fourth with proxima where
3:46 starting from zero i started by being
3:49 the only one in the data team
3:51 and gradually to prove the power of data
3:54 analytics the amount of insights we can
3:57 contribute to the business
3:59 to the team and then
4:01 little by little now we have a
4:04 growing team of five people
4:06 okay so you started as the first data
4:10 person that's that's really yeah
4:12 so what do you do as chief of data
4:16 well that covers a lot as i mentioned i
4:20 really grew my position from ground up
4:23 so at the beginning i was doing a lot of
4:24 hands-on work myself these days i'm
4:27 doing less and less but um our
4:30 functionality really covers a lot of
4:33 aspects of the business from one of our
4:35 biggest parties marketing right if you
4:37 work for
4:39 our nature is a communication marketing
4:41 with the e-commerce so communication
4:43 marketing whenever you do campaign
4:45 communication you always want to measure
4:47 your performance because what measured
4:49 got improved and then among the all the
4:52 marketing channels that we are
4:54 using it's also important to compare and
4:57 against each other to see which channel
5:00 brings the most efficiency the first
5:02 attack the most the least attack so this
5:04 kind of marketing attribution model and
5:07 is something we're working on
5:09 but i have to say as
5:12 the nature of our company because
5:14 when we do publish um for example
5:17 instagram facebook social media if the
5:19 link with one click can review a sex toy
5:23 we cannot really do a like announce use
5:26 advertisement so with that being said a
5:28 lot of our job of being analytics is
5:31 quite tricky so we are very creative
5:35 about how to identify different data
5:37 sources and try to merge and match them
5:40 in different ways to serve our purpose
5:42 and to make the best educated educated
5:45 guests
5:46 and on the other side we also care a lot
5:49 about the business operation since you
5:52 know you have e-commerce going on how
5:54 much prediction of orders coming in for
5:57 each product every day is very important
5:59 to have an estimate then comparing with
6:02 our inventory in the warehouse so with
6:04 this data to the side
6:07 combination we also give business like
6:10 okay we are going to be out of stock in
6:12 one month we need to start purchasing
6:14 this kind of operational site we also
6:16 help
6:17 then on the business side day-to-day
6:19 performance monitoring the we are very
6:22 like web
6:24 e-commerce driven so the performance of
6:26 the traffic and different product
6:28 performance
6:30 conversion our shopify
6:33 air portfolio all these we are touching
6:36 upon as well
6:37 then
6:38 i wanna introduce the last last expect
6:40 that we are going to focus on that's not
6:42 all so you have even more yeah there's a
6:45 lot i just just one more project i'm
6:47 really excited about is
6:49 as we are very customer-centric and we
6:51 want to
6:52 understand and listen to our customer
6:55 better and better so
6:56 we are trying to do a lot of social
6:58 listening and customer survey and this
7:01 kind of non big data-ish
7:04 data analytics we are also doing it
7:07 yeah that's so that's a lot so marketing
7:09 then demand forecasting and then social
7:12 listening so three main approaches right
7:15 what was your first project that you
7:17 started with as a
7:18 the only data person was it marketing or
7:21 something else
7:22 it's more about business
7:25 op house monitoring
7:27 it's about building dashboard a if you
7:29 think about you have an organization to
7:32 start data analytics the most
7:34 low-hanging fruit is actually
7:37 deliver them
7:38 like a timely monitoring about the
7:41 business health
7:42 and what i mean is we have
7:45 various data sources that are very
7:46 important to us our web traffic how many
7:49 traffic is coming every day does it go
7:51 better or worse one day or the other
7:53 because our market campaigns and that's
7:56 our web traffic conversion changed from
7:58 day to day because we
8:00 changed the web design introduced new
8:02 product
8:03 so and so forth so i started
8:05 collaborating with ceo and different
8:07 departments so instead of once a week or
8:10 once every month everyone struggle to
8:12 find the information putting together a
8:14 powerpoint presentation and spend a lot
8:16 of time on it i show them by
8:19 connecting the source and merging them
8:22 well we can discover a lot of rich
8:24 information but and then we can check it
8:26 on the minute on the go
8:28 no that's cool so
8:30 people in the company they realize it's
8:32 very difficult to find information they
8:33 need especially when they want to
8:35 prepare reports like powerpoint
8:37 presentations
8:38 and this is how they came uh this is how
8:41 they realized that they need to hire a
8:43 data person who would help them connect
8:45 all the different data sources in such a
8:48 way that uh
8:49 just one click away right
8:51 i would say it's a little bit the other
8:53 way around
8:54 it's more about the management realize
8:56 okay we do have the need everyone's
8:58 talking about data and to grow further
9:00 for the company maybe something we need
9:02 but people owning the department who is
9:04 producing report day to day they don't
9:07 really they didn't realize that data can
9:09 help them it's more about i remember at
9:12 the beginning i i need to approach each
9:14 department lead or people in the job
9:16 functionality and i say hey you know
9:18 like you make what about you introduce
9:20 me your day-to-day workflow and
9:23 especially when you're doing reporting
9:25 and performance measurement what do you
9:27 do and then i propose them why don't you
9:30 work with me and then we can help you to
9:32 produce automatic uh reporting which
9:35 will get more information more in-depth
9:37 analysis about what is going on and how
9:39 the performance is going
9:40 so i actually need to convince them a
9:42 little bit in the beginning because
9:45 whenever you want to set a you know set
9:48 a dashboard connecting a data source you
9:50 need collaboration from the team to get
9:52 the data and help them to change their
9:54 working flow and habit which is
9:57 can be challenging sometimes but
9:59 sometimes people are very collaborative
10:01 once this got discovered this actually
10:04 bring a lot of value to them
10:06 and wondering did you get any resistance
10:08 uh initially
10:10 yeah yeah and there are some projects
10:12 you know is for the bigger picture of
10:15 the company it doesn't come to the
10:17 pinpoint of each individual and you say
10:20 hey actually we need each team to offer
10:22 us or be careful about this data and
10:25 you you require extra labor for everyone
10:29 but they don't see the benefit directly
10:31 shedding light on them so this kind of
10:33 effort is a little bit difficult
10:36 so it's about making sure that the
10:38 quality of data is good right
10:40 yeah yeah
10:41 okay because the the these
10:44 people these teams were producing some
10:46 data right yes
10:48 some
10:49 yeah sometimes it's
10:51 the world is not ideal like you cannot
10:53 stream all the data and automate
10:54 everything
10:55 and unfortunately like we're trying to
10:58 reduce the amount of spreadsheet we use
11:00 as much as possible but
11:02 many cases is proven that that's the
11:04 best way to collaborate with such a
11:07 business driven company
11:09 so the management realized that
11:11 the way
11:13 people are creating reports it's not the
11:16 most optimal way and then they
11:18 heard that the data analytics can help
11:21 data in general and then this is how
11:24 they realize they need to hire somebody
11:26 they hired you and you started by
11:28 talking with uh every department
11:31 understanding what they are doing there
11:33 uh what kind of data they need or what
11:36 kind of data they create
11:38 and then
11:40 yeah you convince them you showed how
11:42 useful that was right and uh the first
11:45 thing was uh you said business
11:47 monitoring right how well uh the company
11:49 is doing how what happens after a change
11:52 does it lead to
11:53 you know drops in traffic or increases
11:56 in traffic and things like this
11:58 and what happened after that like yeah
12:01 you said now there is a team of five
12:02 people so how did you
12:06 arrive at the point when you needed to
12:08 hire the first person yeah it's been
12:11 it's been a journey actually
12:14 so as i introduced in the beginning the
12:16 low hanging fruit is the dashboard and
12:17 then you realize the team understand ah
12:20 you actually can solve many things for
12:22 us then they come up with more and more
12:24 questions and the requests
12:26 and certain questions and requests they
12:28 definitely go out of the dimension that
12:30 the dashboard could cover so what we do
12:33 is we need to create web apps or models
12:36 to be able to help business make
12:39 decisions and solve their doubts
12:41 and one of the things is demand
12:43 forecasting that's not something this is
12:45 predictive and then we need to start
12:47 building model in-house 3d model means
12:50 you need to have historical data having
12:53 historical data means you need to have a
12:55 data warehouse where you can store the
12:57 information and to stream it
12:59 then you realize okay only having your
13:02 historical sales doesn't help you with
13:04 forecasting to forecast there is many
13:06 factors to consider
13:08 right there is like depending on the
13:10 product or what is your promotion event
13:12 of the company and as a
13:15 as a company that is so active every day
13:17 we have a lot of events going on so it's
13:20 like you need to ask each department
13:23 to give give you data before they make
13:25 the action it's like kind of
13:27 tell me what you're gonna do in the next
13:29 week or month
13:30 and as
13:32 i don't know about many business but i
13:35 tend to see this it's like your decision
13:37 making change from day to day so it's
13:40 very difficult to convince the team to
13:42 really give you a forecast of even one
13:44 week ahead when they are not sure what
13:46 is going to happen but without that
13:48 provision we cannot forecast so this
13:50 kind of balance is something we were
13:53 instead of one of the effort we were
13:55 making
13:56 so going from there is like there are
13:58 some
13:59 um bigger projects that about model
14:01 development
14:02 then once we have this model how to
14:05 deliver it like it's a it's a project
14:08 that in the end we want to benefit the
14:10 business right then how can the business
14:12 really use and take advantage of it we
14:14 cannot give them a jupiter notebook or a
14:17 pie chart pie file
14:19 for them to use they don't understand
14:21 so how to build a web app so user can
14:25 enter
14:26 and fine-tune one or two filters
14:28 parameters then they get the result they
14:30 want so that also includes web app dev
14:34 deployment and
14:37 a lot of more things coming up
14:39 at the beginning
14:40 were you trying to do this all by
14:42 yourself at the beginning i'm about to
14:44 explain so at the beginning
14:46 the machine learning
14:48 like multi-building i wasn't enjoying it
14:50 because i also enjoy coding very much
14:54 but then at the moment of deliveries
14:55 like i really have no idea like i
14:58 totally skipped my data engineering
15:00 class in school well i would look at the
15:02 data engineering class yeah like i
15:04 didn't think was important at all
15:06 but
15:07 now it comes the time i regret and then
15:10 i start seeking for help at the
15:12 beginning like
15:14 when i had my first hire is more about
15:16 because we have a lot of demand for
15:19 dashboarding this skill is like one of
15:21 the main
15:23 main tasks that we are dedicating to so
15:25 my first hire is actually a data analyst
15:28 is not an engineer
15:29 and then
15:30 i was seeking help from
15:33 my previous professor to or some
15:36 existing
15:37 solutions in the market that you know
15:39 like it's like plug and play and then
15:41 you can get your information
15:44 i tried but in the end as the model
15:47 just varies a lot and the data source
15:50 and the data output is very different it
15:52 starts to go beyond my capacity and
15:56 asking for help meaning i need to wait
15:59 because
16:00 they are not part of a member of our
16:02 team right
16:03 then
16:04 is very fortunate that the management
16:07 also
16:08 like
16:09 grow enough trust in our team that we
16:12 can have the capacity to hire our data
16:15 engineer which is totally a game changer
16:18 so
16:19 from here on we are
16:21 moving more freely and then the team
16:23 like the analytics can focus more on the
16:26 analytics side and the back end we have
16:28 a engineer to
16:30 give us a lot of care and information
16:32 which is
16:33 which is really good
16:35 so basically the first person you hired
16:38 was data analysts to help you create
16:41 dashboards but then you realize that you
16:43 have a lot of data that you need to you
16:46 need to have a lot of historical data
16:47 that you need to process you need to
16:49 start somewhere
16:50 and this was quite difficult for you
16:52 even though you like coding and
16:55 you also said you you asked for help but
16:59 this was taking forever so that's why
17:01 you hired a
17:03 data engineer right and then from that
17:05 point uh you
17:06 yeah look at your data very house right
17:08 and now building models became yeah i
17:11 actually was able to configure the data
17:13 warehouse and with like stitch i was
17:16 using like the options in the market and
17:18 i was very proud feel i'm learning a lot
17:20 but still not enough to keep pace with
17:23 the growth
17:24 and then just to finish up the flow then
17:27 later the next step we hired another
17:28 data scientist to grow more in depth
17:31 bring more like statistical model
17:33 building
17:34 more in-depth data knowledge to the team
17:37 and then we realize
17:39 you know as our company is not really
17:42 you know ai machine learning driven it's
17:43 more about everything analytics serving
17:46 business to provide
17:47 insights so having this
17:50 side of business communication is very
17:52 important and as a data team we need to
17:54 work really loud because if we do not
17:57 tell the team what we are producing the
17:59 toys developed but they just sit there
18:01 no one use them and we are just wasting
18:03 our time and energy so we the last
18:06 person who incorporated our team is
18:09 called a business analyst slash data
18:12 researcher whose main job is to
18:14 communicate from our team to the
18:16 business side so we'll publish like a
18:19 weekly five bullet newsletter it's like
18:21 a quick image graph to show business
18:24 insights and the updates of the team
18:26 finishing with a meme so
18:28 and then some workshops we're doing with
18:30 the company to introduce our latest
18:32 development so that's the current
18:35 project picture and we're we're looking
18:38 to grow it more this year
18:40 that's interesting especially the last
18:42 row you mentioned this business analyst
18:44 slash data researcher so the problem you
18:47 had there when you were growing your
18:49 team you realized that uh you know you
18:51 have these tools you have these
18:52 dashboards you have these web services
18:54 but
18:54 people were hesitant to
18:56 to use them or what was the problem
18:58 there
18:59 yes so we
19:01 a lot of a big part of our opr of the
19:05 data team is to build this culture and
19:07 we realize only
19:09 we putting the data part very advanced
19:12 is not helpful we need to
19:14 also move forward with the whole team
19:17 and that effort since everyone is so
19:20 busy with the day-to-day workflow no one
19:22 is doing it like giving a presentation
19:24 is diverging the data scientists from
19:27 their daily workflow and it's something
19:29 they are not 100 interested in so we
19:33 realize we have the need for this role
19:36 so data scientists
19:38 should be doing this but uh that's not
19:40 the main focus they would rather spend
19:42 time
19:44 doing models or is more data scientists
19:46 if they personally share information it
19:49 could be more within the team like but
19:52 then to communicate with the business
19:54 side answer stakeholder questions
19:57 it's it's a different profile
20:00 yeah that's quite interesting so you
20:02 have a data analyst you have a data
20:04 engineer you have a data scientist and
20:06 then you have business analyst and then
20:09 you as a
20:11 leader of the team right yeah so five
20:13 people in total
20:14 did they miss anyone
20:16 no no but
20:17 maybe some will
20:19 we're looking for more profiles
20:21 can you already share what kind of uh
20:24 profiles are you looking for what kind
20:26 of yeah we're looking at the senior
20:27 analyst
20:29 so you the analyst needs some help
20:32 yes yeah it's more about growing the
20:34 team and the kind of grow bigger vision
20:38 and have even more ambitious goals
20:42 and
20:42 yeah
20:44 you mentioned
20:45 you did your masters in barcelona right
20:47 and then
20:49 after graduating you started with this
20:51 position right or was there something in
20:54 between no i was working with the global
20:56 while i was doing my master's so moba it
20:59 started yeah it started as an intern
21:01 then full time
21:02 and then for some personal reasons i had
21:05 to leave for a while then i joined
21:07 yeah because i'm wondering uh that's
21:11 sounds like a lot of um
21:13 you know responsibility being the first
21:15 data person right so you really need to
21:18 know a lot to be able to be
21:20 you know useful right so you need to
21:23 know
21:24 things about like processes how exactly
21:26 you collect data how you
21:28 get insights from beta
21:30 um
21:31 you already knew this from global right
21:34 or you had to learn most of this stuff
21:36 yes i don't think you
21:38 necessarily need to know a lot
21:40 it's rather you should be ready to learn
21:42 a lot
21:45 so when i joined the job as i said like
21:48 i have no idea i need to do etl elt
21:52 data warehouse
21:53 engineering web app deployment
21:56 this all this kind of thing i learned
21:58 like oh
22:00 i hope you at least kept the slides from
22:02 your data engineering course and could
22:05 yeah go through them
22:06 yeah well i have to say i was more doing
22:09 research to search for the new products
22:11 because the
22:13 the space is changing so fast like
22:15 materials from two years ago might well
22:17 be updated
22:20 and i guess since you don't have a large
22:23 team most of the solutions you use there
22:26 so you're not building them in-house you
22:28 use some of the shelf solutions
22:30 exactly so what kind of stack are you
22:32 using
22:34 so
22:34 as i said we started with stitch
22:37 and we are on tcp and in terms of data
22:41 engineering the process we are using dbt
22:44 and then in terms of visualization bi we
22:47 are using
22:48 google data studio
22:51 am i missing something
22:53 and i think one thing very important how
22:56 do we deliver to business is we build an
22:58 internal wiki for data so we have a
23:01 notion
23:02 where we detail our analysis and track
23:05 our workflows to present
23:07 links of dashboards and everything to
23:09 the company
23:11 yeah that's that's interesting thanks
23:14 so uh
23:15 actually before um when i was preparing
23:19 for the interview i took a look at your
23:21 linkedin profile and then there was a
23:24 line for the current your current job
23:27 that was saying that your responsibility
23:30 is building a leading data team to
23:32 provide accurate timely and useful
23:34 insights to empower the company to make
23:36 the best decision possible
23:38 i think that's quite a packed sentence
23:41 and
23:42 yeah so i was wondering
23:44 if we can a little bit decompose it so
23:46 there are many many different parts and
23:48 i think like every word here means a lot
23:51 and i'm interested to know what exactly
23:56 you are doing there because i think
23:58 every every word here sounds very
24:00 interesting so
24:03 let's talk a bit about this and
24:04 decompose so
24:06 maybe we can start with building and
24:08 leading data teams so how i think we
24:11 already talked about this to a large
24:13 extent like how exactly you realize that
24:16 uh
24:17 you know who
24:19 we need and also in which order
24:22 maybe the question i have is um
24:24 let's say if you needed to do this again
24:27 would you
24:28 hire people in the same order or what
24:30 kind of order you think is a
24:33 good one
24:34 very good question
24:35 so actually i would say
24:37 no i would change
24:40 and
24:42 first of all when i did my first hire i
24:46 have to say i always
24:47 participate in talks to encourage women
24:50 to overcome the imposter syndrome you
24:53 think
24:54 but i think i was suffering from a
24:55 little bit impressive syndrome even
24:57 though i was very sure that i can build
24:59 the team and i can achieve my great
25:02 things but when i asked for help the
25:05 first time i was a little bit shy i was
25:08 thinking i'm still at the phase of
25:10 proving my value to the company
25:12 i couldn't just ask for a very senior
25:14 profile to join me immediately so my
25:17 first hire was a junior analyst which
25:19 proved to be a very helpful and very
25:21 talented asset to the team but it's not
25:24 usually the case so after this i also
25:27 have talked with many data leaders
25:29 especially at the beginning phase of the
25:31 team development it's very important to
25:34 have senior people on hand especially
25:38 think about you are setting a foundation
25:40 and in the future development everything
25:41 is built up from what you said initially
25:44 right there are some changes but many
25:46 things are built up from here so
25:49 be willing to invest and bring some
25:52 really like more experienced people on
25:54 the team in the beginning could be good
25:57 although i think i'm very lucky in the
25:59 sense my my first my first hire was to
26:02 very talented bring many good insights
26:06 and then like be brave about hiring
26:08 engineer when one is needed like it it
26:11 really solves a lot of
26:13 problem and headache that like it took
26:16 me days but for them it's like a matter
26:18 of hours to
26:19 to resolve yeah
26:21 so in which order would you hire first
26:23 senior analyst or
26:25 this really depends this depends on the
26:27 company right if your company is very
26:30 like there's a lot of data
26:32 infrastructure then engineer first
26:34 because personally i can do analytics so
26:37 that part i'm not worried but then if
26:39 it's a business driven position
26:42 actually
26:43 i would do them both together engineers
26:45 are important
26:47 so
26:48 the only challenge now is to explain the
26:51 management uh that you need two
26:52 positions and then ask for budget for
26:54 two people especially if you're asking
26:56 for two senior people
26:58 uh then maybe it's a tough uh
27:02 a tough one to you know
27:04 to
27:05 uh
27:06 yeah interesting so you would hire a
27:10 more experienced analyst like maybe a
27:11 senior somebody is a senior than
27:14 a data engineer maybe at the same time
27:16 both
27:17 and then a data scientist right or would
27:19 you hire maybe a business analyst
27:21 or only at the end so if i'm hiring an
27:24 engineer first maybe
27:25 since the technical side is very well
27:27 covered i would do a business analyst
27:29 because
27:30 given the property of our business is
27:32 very we're very
27:34 stakeholder talking with different
27:36 departments and business operations
27:38 so it's important for us
27:41 so did you say that you would hire even
27:43 before an engineer or i misunderstood it
27:51 so
27:52 it means you will hire three people at
27:54 the same time right
27:55 if possible
27:57 i will be in the team and i will hire a
27:59 business analyst and engineer
28:01 okay yeah okay
28:03 so so the plan like let's say if
28:05 somebody wants to build a team right so
28:07 the plan is they need to find a company
28:10 who doesn't have a data person yet right
28:12 so they
28:13 get into this company so they work hard
28:16 they show value right they show that
28:18 okay like
28:20 you mentioned there are some low-hanging
28:21 fruits like you can build dashboards and
28:23 then you need to do a lot of talking so
28:25 you do that you build dashboards and
28:27 then the management sees that this is
28:29 very useful and then you start
28:31 convincing
28:32 them to give budget for more people and
28:36 then you hire a business analyst and a
28:38 data engineer right and then you hire a
28:41 data
28:42 data analyst right yeah
28:44 and then you have a data scientist at
28:46 the end yeah i have to say this all
28:48 depends a lot on what business you're in
28:50 and what projects you have in mind if
28:53 all your projects are about building
28:54 that first then no need for well some
28:57 need but no dire need for engineer you
28:59 know
29:00 but if you're developing more in-depth
29:01 analysis publishing web app or there's
29:04 more data from different stores coming
29:06 in then yes
29:08 and the data scientist is first because
29:11 probably there are a lot more work that
29:14 should happen before data scientists can
29:16 join right exactly
29:19 but um for you i think you mentioned
29:21 that this demand forecasting project it
29:24 appeared quite soon enough right
29:28 yeah
29:29 actually that's one of the first thing i
29:31 worked on when i joined the company
29:33 because that was a pain point of the
29:35 business it's like how much are we gonna
29:37 sell how do we manage the workflow you
29:39 know
29:41 of the warehouse so
29:43 i started with that but it's proven to
29:46 be not easy at all
29:49 so up to this day we're still in the
29:50 iteration and develop for the
29:52 development of the model and uh
29:55 yeah like one of the components as i
29:57 mentioned is like how to get the
30:00 provision of
30:01 data from all the business components
30:04 and that's proven to be a little
30:05 challenge
30:07 yeah does it mean that for some so this
30:09 demand forecasting sounds like a machine
30:11 learning program pro problem right so
30:13 this is something you saw with data
30:14 science with machine learning
30:16 but i guess in many cases this is
30:18 something that an analyst can solve
30:20 right so you don't need a data scientist
30:22 who goes uh
30:25 you know with a lot of machine learning
30:26 but more somebody who is uh who is more
30:29 on analytics side who can analyze the
30:31 data and then build a simpler model
30:33 right
30:34 yeah yeah we when i asked for a data
30:38 when i was looking for data scientist
30:39 profile it's nothing about like hardcore
30:42 data scientists it's more about who
30:45 has who can do a little bit of
30:48 basic analytics bi and
30:50 has a passion for developing models and
30:53 that for us is proven to be sufficient
30:56 so would you
30:58 require your data analysts or would it
31:01 be a nice to have quality for data and
31:03 this to know some machine learning or
31:05 just to know some
31:07 um you know time series modeling
31:10 i would say so like a
31:13 it's a test you know people who are in
31:15 data they got in the field naturally
31:17 they they know machine learning and they
31:20 grow some interesting development models
31:22 so it's like a proven of passion for me
31:25 almost it doesn't mean they've done like
31:27 a hundred projects in it but it's like
31:29 they show they are willing to learn and
31:32 to develop that curiosity
31:35 is is good
31:37 and i think is
31:39 at least my impressions i don't work as
31:40 a data analyst but my impression is that
31:44 analysts deal a lot with time series
31:46 data like all these dashboards
31:48 most of the time this is time series
31:50 data i don't know like profit or losses
31:52 or i know some kpis
31:54 and then sometimes
31:56 somebody comes and says
31:57 how this will
31:59 will this kpi look like in three months
32:02 and then here you go you have this uh
32:04 time series problem right
32:06 yeah
32:07 so did it happen to you as well
32:10 well i think
32:12 our business
32:14 stakeholders has been more understanding
32:16 because they know we are not the one who
32:18 are deciding that we our job is really
32:21 to help monitor and say
32:24 but like we are more looking at
32:25 historical information for example we
32:28 had a promotion on free shipping and we
32:30 understand from historical data that
32:33 free shipping
32:34 helped to increase certain percent of
32:36 our conversion web performance so next
32:38 time one business has a goal of
32:41 increasing conversion or performance we
32:43 can propose that as a solution and give
32:45 them an estimate about how much
32:47 difference do we expect to see
32:49 but we never tell them we're gonna be
32:51 here or there it's more about giving
32:53 advice because in the end it's like if
32:56 we run a marketing campaign every time
32:57 it's going to be different and the
32:59 successfulness of the different
33:02 campaigns
33:03 matters a lot it's about our creativity
33:05 the timing how we communicate
33:09 thanks
33:10 um
33:11 i have a lot of questions that i
33:14 didn't send you in uh this list of
33:16 questions that i prepared so
33:18 so the question i have is uh
33:21 um so i'm wondering what kind of
33:22 qualities you need to have as a first
33:25 data
33:26 person like
33:27 should you be more like on the analytics
33:29 side should you be more on the
33:31 engineering side or does it even matter
33:34 what do you think
33:36 i think to start
33:39 i'm the one with more analytics profile
33:42 and i don't i think the most important
33:45 thing is
33:46 i kind of i align with the business
33:48 stakeholder what do we want to do with
33:50 the data and how you can really help the
33:52 business
33:53 and with that being said i would argue
33:56 that business understanding is actually
33:58 the most key component especially you're
34:00 living leading the team right and then
34:04 waiting is to learn and learn fast
34:07 because
34:08 just there's so many things changing and
34:11 if you're growing a department finding
34:13 talents i need to hire an engineer where
34:15 i have zero engineer knowledge imagine
34:18 so it's like a lot of things i need to
34:20 dig into and prepare myself for
34:22 so
34:23 yeah i guess
34:26 so as you said the most important thing
34:27 is aligning with business stakeholders
34:30 which is more like about your
34:32 communication skills yeah rather than
34:34 anything else
34:36 and i think analysts are
34:38 in general uh better in this in
34:41 communication than engineers at least
34:43 this is my observation from uh you know
34:46 my colleagues and former colleagues that
34:47 analysts are more into communicating
34:49 than uh than engineers right yeah yeah
34:53 okay so probably somebody with uh
34:56 analytical and communication skills will
34:58 be a better first hire first data person
35:01 right
35:02 yeah just to to really understand what
35:04 business needs from the data team before
35:07 because
35:08 imagine if you want to start a
35:10 data team it doesn't
35:12 usually it doesn't limit to one person
35:14 and you need this one to lead and grow
35:16 the team
35:17 they need to have this leadership asset
35:19 rather than technical assets it's more
35:21 important for them to know
35:24 what profile what technical skills can i
35:27 bring the team to complete
35:29 to achieve our mission rather than they
35:32 have the skills themselves so it's like
35:34 overall big picture is very important
35:37 yeah thanks so let me again repeat the
35:40 sentence from your linkedin
35:42 so we already talked about building and
35:44 leading data teams and then
35:46 next is to
35:48 provide accurate timely and useful
35:50 insights and then to empower the company
35:53 to make the best decisions possible so
35:55 now i'm
35:56 wondering about uh so i want to ask you
35:59 about this to provide accurate timely
36:01 and useful insights
36:03 so
36:05 um
36:06 what do you mean like why does it even
36:08 matter that the results are accurate
36:10 timely and useful yeah so
36:13 accurate
36:14 it's something
36:16 i
36:16 some error i committed while developing
36:19 a data team because
36:21 you know sometimes you're just very
36:23 happy that your dashboard is working and
36:25 you can finally show show something to
36:28 help the business
36:29 but what you don't realize is the same
36:32 seemingly working dashboard is showing
36:35 wrong data and then
36:37 that that is very troublesome that could
36:40 be some of our data source got broken or
36:43 when the team is updating information
36:45 instead of a dot they put a comma and
36:48 then the reading got like a thousand
36:50 times different
36:51 so that maybe that change our product
36:54 price or product cost
36:56 and that totally messed up the whole
36:59 dashboard information we are conveying
37:01 right
37:02 so what kind of
37:04 consequences are there when something
37:07 like that happens
37:08 so i have to say luckily all this
37:12 well the error we committed was
37:15 discovered by our business departments
37:18 first instead of they use it to make
37:21 business decisions
37:22 for example the product cost or
37:26 the our profit margin is like all of a
37:28 sudden it shrinks a lot because business
37:31 like from the operational team they put
37:32 the product cost to a very big number
37:34 because of the common thought difference
37:37 you know and then the business what did
37:39 we do wrong
37:41 from this day on and all of our
37:44 profits are gone and it's should it be a
37:46 business emergency but in the end we
37:49 figure out is the fault from our side so
37:52 from that incident on
37:54 i couldn't say i it would just happen
37:56 once i get different errors that i
37:58 couldn't i wasn't able to foresee happen
38:01 and i realized how important data
38:03 accuracy and to reduce data downtime is
38:06 so from there on with the engineer and
38:08 different analysts we really focus a lot
38:11 on the
38:13 our information
38:14 updating maintenance and the regular
38:17 check before it's some area that i would
38:20 ignore a lot but now you realize that
38:23 keeping developing things is cool but
38:26 keep things working and delivering
38:28 correct information is even cooler so
38:29 it's even more important
38:31 so accuracy for that
38:34 so did you have any uh trust problems
38:38 like
38:38 from business people that uh you know
38:41 they see that dashboards have errors and
38:44 uh you know they say okay yeah maybe i
38:46 shouldn't really uh trust this dashboard
38:48 i'll just uh you know do my own thing
38:50 without relying relying on data and make
38:53 decisions without using that uh or you
38:57 didn't have to deal with this
38:58 yeah as this happened definitely there
39:00 is frustration no like businesses are
39:02 really
39:03 initially they think you're great you're
39:06 offering them great tools to make
39:07 decisions upon then then they realize
39:10 it's not reliable of course there is
39:12 frustration but
39:13 it happens like no one do not make
39:16 mistakes and as we are developing the
39:19 team is also the since we're learning a
39:21 way so what we did is we really took it
39:24 very seriously from there on we
39:26 developed uh
39:28 like we did research consulted on the
39:30 people in the area so we developed like
39:32 a white paper like a playbook for
39:35 internally for our team to ensure that
39:38 accuracy and to improve data governance
39:40 and from here on we also like just be
39:43 very open about
39:45 what error we've made because of our
39:47 ignorance and then what policies and
39:50 solutions we're going to present in for
39:51 the next steps
39:53 so that the business and us are are
39:55 aligned and they're also very
39:57 understanding
39:58 so basically
40:00 you
40:01 try to be transparent you say that we
40:03 made this error uh there is some
40:05 mistaken data we're working on fixing it
40:08 right yeah okay
40:11 and yeah so you mentioned playbook i
40:13 don't know how
40:14 sensitive this information is about this
40:16 playbook but if it's not maybe you can
40:18 tell us in a few words what kind of uh
40:21 what is it there in this playbook oh we
40:24 are updating it like here and there but
40:27 you know as the error i mentioned is we
40:30 need to educate each team how to input
40:32 information and then from our site it's
40:35 like
1:00:24 you
