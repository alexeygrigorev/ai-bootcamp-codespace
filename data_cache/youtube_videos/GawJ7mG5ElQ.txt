0:00 so this week we'll talk about switching
0:02 careers from marketing to analytics
0:04 engineering and we have a special guest
0:06 today Nikola so Nikki started here
0:09 career as a Performance Marketing
0:11 specialist
0:12 um
0:13 and to quickly realize that she needs to
0:16 rely on data to make good decisions
0:18 that's how her data Journey started and
0:21 she eventually became an analytics
0:22 engineer and in this interview we'll
0:25 know how that happened so welcome to our
0:28 uh to our event
0:30 thank you very much for having me
0:32 and so I want to mention so this is
0:35 something new
0:37 questions for this interview were
0:39 prepared by liat shamesh and Victoria
0:41 Perez molar so thanks a lot for your
0:44 help in uh in preparing the questions
0:46 and if anyone's here who is listening
0:48 want to help us prepare for more
0:51 interviews in the future please reach
0:52 out to me okay and let's start so before
0:56 we go into our main topic of switching
0:58 to analytics engineering let's start
1:00 with your background can you tell us
1:02 about your career Journey so far
1:04 yeah of course
1:06 um so yeah I actually uh studied in the
1:09 UK in London and I moved over to Berlin
1:11 soon after graduating from my bachelor's
1:14 um quite spontaneously
1:17 um and I found myself uh just in the
1:21 Berlin startup scene like many
1:23 English-speaking people do uh because it
1:25 was pretty much the only available
1:28 um route so I started out working for
1:31 movinga which was a big
1:34 um removals startup
1:37 um backed by rocket internet and I was
1:38 working in the operations
1:40 um Team there so I kind of had my first
1:43 um Taste of working at a startup
1:46 um there that was of course as you can
1:48 imagine very
1:50 um intense fast growth lots of change
1:53 um so it was kind of the baptism of fire
1:56 um
1:56 for six months and after that I uh found
2:00 a job at ekovia um I was really
2:03 following a Cozier really closely
2:05 because I really was inspired by the
2:06 business model and the mission so for
2:09 those who don't know Cozier is the uh
2:12 search engine that uses its profits to
2:14 plant trees
2:16 um so yeah it's essentially
2:18 um
2:19 it's a purpose company which means that
2:22 yeah profits are basically entirely used
2:24 towards
2:25 um yeah financing uh the tree planting
2:28 project
2:29 um so yeah then I suddenly saw a job for
2:33 a kind of generalist marketing role
2:35 which I applied for
2:39 um and yeah so my first role at Cozier
2:41 was actually
2:43 um sort of more generic marketing
2:46 um was it something that you also did uh
2:49 Moringa like
2:51 or was it something different it was
2:53 completely different um but it was stuff
2:55 that
2:56 um
2:56 it was kind of a generalist kind of
2:58 Junior role where you're kind of helping
3:00 like write press releases
3:02 um think up campaigns
3:05 um yeah reaching out to potential
3:07 Partners this kind of work and I've done
3:09 quite a lot of that through University
3:11 and I've been volunteering for a
3:14 um an organization that helped students
3:18 get into
3:19 um volunteering
3:21 um so through that kind of work and
3:23 through more kind of actually not
3:24 professional
3:26 um work rather just like
3:29 um more
3:30 organizing political work and stuff I've
3:33 done at University that's kind of where
3:35 I had those event event planning
3:38 um where I built up those kind of
3:40 organizational and marketing skills from
3:43 so that's essentially what what um I
3:46 ended up really speaking about largely
3:47 at the at the interview
3:49 um and we were a really small company we
3:51 were 15
3:52 um
3:53 uh people when I joined
3:55 um so it was really one of those early
3:57 stage kind of startups were doing
3:58 whatever job needs to be done sometimes
4:01 it was replying to use the feedback at
4:04 the times it was helping test or
4:07 new app design or all sorts of things
4:12 um but yeah at some point I
4:15 um I felt like I really wanted to go
4:17 deeper into a an area and
4:21 um
4:22 yeah I basically started running the
4:24 um paid campaigns that we sort of
4:28 started doing after I joined the company
4:31 um first on Facebook but later then we
4:33 expanded on to YouTube and Instagram
4:36 um and I really enjoyed
4:38 um that I found it very helpful to
4:41 really focus in
4:42 um on a specific
4:44 um area and something I found very
4:46 gratifying about Performance Marketing
4:48 was you get kind of results very quickly
4:50 so you can kind of really see what's
4:52 working and what's not working
4:54 um as opposed to other areas of
4:55 marketing where something like you know
4:57 a press campaign or
4:59 um a brand activation you know it's not
5:02 necessarily clear what impact that might
5:05 have had right away and sometimes it's
5:07 really difficult or almost impossible to
5:09 measure
5:10 which I found very frustrating
5:13 um but with Performance Marketing like
5:15 the data you're given immediately and
5:17 you can analyze that and make a decision
5:19 in in minutes on how to to move forward
5:24 um so I got really really into that I
5:25 had
5:26 um of course there are so many online
5:28 resources for Performance Marketing and
5:30 in general and it's relatively new
5:32 discipline as well in the yeah grand
5:35 scheme of history of marketing so
5:38 um yeah I was really able to kind of
5:40 uh dive into that by myself largely
5:44 um and I was given a lot of
5:45 responsibility at the company as well so
5:47 I yeah learned that way I did that for
5:50 two years
5:52 um and at some point I also started to
5:55 kind of think okay well
5:57 I feel like I've kind of understood this
6:00 and it maybe has its like limits in
6:02 terms of
6:03 um what's interesting or not so and the
6:06 part that I really enjoyed was
6:08 looking at looking at the data coming in
6:10 analyzing what are the click-through
6:12 rate saying what are the conversion
6:13 rates what does that mean
6:16 um
6:17 um yeah how can we optimize this
6:18 campaign based on the data that we're
6:20 getting uh how does it compare with
6:22 historical Trends all of this sort of
6:25 work I really enjoyed
6:28 um and at the same time I'd um around
6:31 this time the company uh had switched to
6:33 lookup from tableau
6:36 um and at the time we only had one
6:38 um data um person at cosia
6:42 um so I helped her with the migration to
6:46 looker just as like a side project
6:48 and since I was kind of the person who
6:51 was most comfortable with data and
6:53 Reporting and numbers and um yeah
6:56 measuring kpis and whatnot in the
6:58 marketing team I took on building out
7:00 the marketing team reporting
7:02 and I really enjoyed that what's your
7:04 initiative right so nobody like told you
7:06 hey you should do this you just okay
7:08 like sounds interesting I really like
7:10 this topic and I kind of learned
7:12 everything that was there about
7:13 Performance Marketing so let me try to
7:15 also learn this new tool yeah exactly
7:19 and I think at this point it wasn't
7:20 really clear to me that I wanted to
7:21 necessarily move into the data team I
7:24 just wanted to maybe have more focus on
7:27 numbers and data in general but probably
7:30 still within the marketing team
7:32 um
7:33 and then eventually I think what the big
7:36 shift happened was I think the pandemic
7:38 um
7:39 hit and I think like a lot of people
7:42 just forced me to to consider
7:46 um you know what I was doing and whether
7:48 I was happy in my role and I really
7:49 found that I I really wasn't
7:52 um and at this point I decided to
7:56 um yeah make the shift
7:59 um
8:00 into the bi team and I think at this
8:03 point I had already been
8:05 um I'd already done a sequel course
8:08 um some months before
8:10 um I guess with a view to going down the
8:13 kind of marketing analytics route
8:16 um but with the pandemic I really
8:18 realized that I wanted to move away from
8:22 yeah purely marketing focus and go yeah
8:25 towards um the FBI
8:28 were you taking the courses this secure
8:32 SQL forces now
8:34 like did you have a plan that you want
8:37 to work in the Via team eventually or it
8:40 was like okay let me see what I should
8:42 do to do my job better
8:48 [Music]
8:49 um
8:50 my colleague in the bi team who
8:52 I think in the context rather of being a
8:56 sort of like marketing analyst persons I
8:58 think initially the idea was kind of I'd
9:00 sit maybe between marketing and bi
9:04 um
9:05 but I think it's because I sort of
9:06 really didn't think it was possible for
9:08 me to move
9:10 um Department that hadn't really
9:11 happened in the company before so there
9:13 wasn't really an example of that
9:15 um to me
9:17 um so I think I was kind of rather
9:19 thinking well what's possible what could
9:21 I do and then it was this kind of
9:22 marketing analyst role
9:25 um but uh yeah definitely I took the
9:29 sequel course in order to yeah move
9:32 closer towards the um yeah data side of
9:35 the
9:36 how did you so then you realized okay
9:39 maybe I'm not really super happy with
9:41 the job I'm doing in the marketing
9:43 department and then there is this bi
9:45 team so did you just approach them and
9:48 say and ask can I just join you and
9:51 start working with your how did this
9:53 happen yeah I think eventually
9:56 yes I think eventually the conversation
9:58 was already there as I mentioned before
10:00 around how to become more into this
10:03 marketing analyst role and
10:05 already my colleague was giving me lots
10:08 of advice and
10:10 I think probably through that process
10:12 and conversations
10:13 the possibility of me moving into the bi
10:16 team like came up to be honest I don't
10:18 remember exactly who brought it up
10:21 um but
10:24 um I think what I remember is you know
10:27 the my colleagues my colleague MBI is
10:29 saying well these are the things that we
10:31 really need you to have and then once
10:35 you have those things you can there's no
10:37 reason why you shouldn't be able to join
10:39 the team as a as a junior analyst
10:41 um do you remember what these things
10:43 were yes I suppose yes equals the main
10:47 thing and then
10:49 um learning the learning understanding
10:51 the data pipeline that we had
10:54 um so it wasn't like a list of courses
10:56 you have to take but rather okay these
10:58 are the things we work on and try to
11:01 figure out what's happening there yeah
11:03 exactly exactly I think in terms of the
11:05 I mean she even you know one of the
11:08 things was like python would be great
11:09 but I ended up doing a python course
11:12 that barely actually using it and
11:16 um
11:17 it's yeah it's been useful to have but
11:19 of all the things I think the most
11:22 useful practically was jumping into the
11:27 once once learning sequel has been once
11:30 you know SQL and you can write and read
11:31 SQL you'll still need to get good at
11:34 reading and writing SQL and you start
11:36 coming across much more complicated SQL
11:38 queries and you're like there's
11:40 like a nested Loop here at like I don't
11:42 know where this is coming from so then
11:44 improving the your sequel to be able to
11:47 to read and understand uh much more
11:51 complex data models so that was kind of
11:53 a big part of the journey and was really
11:55 understanding
11:57 um what our models were how everything
12:00 um yeah fit together in the wider scheme
12:03 of the pipeline and how it came to be
12:05 that
12:06 um because I had no idea even like what
12:08 really how a Tracker really worked I
12:10 just sort of knew that there was this
12:11 thing called the snowplow tracker that
12:13 like collected the data but
12:15 it was all sort of um
12:17 uh yeah not very not very like detailed
12:20 knowledge so really going in and
12:22 understanding like how things really
12:24 work
12:25 um to get the data from one point to the
12:27 other and transform it
12:29 um did you need to keep doing your you
12:32 know old job of marketing Specialist or
12:36 you completely could in like start like
12:40 just uh started oh immerse yourself in
12:44 in this bi or there was like some in
12:48 between period where you had to do both
12:50 yeah I think it was
12:53 well to be honest I'd already been doing
12:56 the Performance Marketing role I was
12:57 also doing I was really acting like a
12:59 kind of marketing analyst in a way and
13:02 building the reporting for the teams and
13:04 you know people who were doing other
13:05 jobs I was kind of helping them build
13:07 reports and managing that so I was
13:10 already kind of doing a lot of that kind
13:12 of work so there was a transition period
13:15 where kind of like the first projects
13:16 that I've worked on were sort of more
13:17 marketing focused like I think one of
13:20 the main projects was
13:23 um
13:24 are helping establish like how to
13:26 measure brand campaigns
13:29 um yeah looking into that and like
13:31 building dashboards based to that and
13:33 kind of a wider topic around that and
13:35 but yeah I think it was kind of a
13:38 transition but at some point
13:41 um yeah I just handed over the main
13:43 Performance Marketing tasks which are
13:45 managing the campaigns but it was it was
13:47 quite a good moment because
13:49 the pandemic meant that
13:53 um we were already hitting a kind of
13:55 slight stagnation point with some of our
13:57 campaigns and then pandemic hit and it
13:59 was really difficult to record new new
14:02 ads as well um in quarantine so
14:06 um there was a kind of natural slowing
14:08 down of that side of the work anyway so
14:10 it was a good moment to um to Pivot
14:14 and what do you do now what what do your
14:17 responsibilities include
14:20 so I'm working as a yeah as I've
14:22 mentioned analytics engineer but also
14:24 data analysts so we are still a
14:26 relatively small team we are um four
14:29 people in in total
14:31 um uh yeah for reference the company
14:33 size is just over 100.
14:36 um so we
14:39 um don't none of us have a particularly
14:42 specialized role we kind of do a little
14:44 bit of everything and at the moment
14:47 um our team lead is on extended uh leave
14:50 so I'm acting as interim
14:52 um Team lead so a lot of work is really
14:54 working with the new CPO who's just come
14:57 in reassessing we keep kpis that we have
15:00 of the company how we measure them
15:02 um
15:03 yeah of course
15:05 um as a quite common I mean I think a
15:07 new sea level comes in as often a
15:10 rehashing of dashboards and um reworking
15:13 of them
15:14 the core reporting
15:16 um to suit the new the new requirements
15:19 um so a lot of work has been recently
15:20 done on that
15:22 um
15:23 we also each uh there's like two two of
15:27 us that are kind of these analysts
15:29 um in analyst roles and we work very
15:32 closely with the product managers so
15:33 we're focusing very closely on
15:35 supporting the various product teams
15:37 with experimentation and building out
15:40 new features a b testing and evaluating
15:44 those and yeah where necessary
15:47 um building out our data model to
15:50 um to reflect those new
15:52 uh changes
15:54 um as I think the day-to-day is really a
15:57 mixture of
15:58 um supporting the teams so a lot of
16:02 sometimes ad hoc analysis needed if for
16:05 example there is a new feature being
16:07 developed and there's some hypothesis
16:09 around yeah
16:11 um yeah the kind of user that they want
16:14 to reach and how big those cohorts might
16:15 be they're kind of yeah jumping into
16:18 the data and taking a look at that and
16:20 other workers maybe more on an
16:22 initiative of our own so for example
16:25 recently we ran a big rfm analysis so
16:28 recency frequency monetary user Behavior
16:31 Analysis
16:34 um which was a bigger project
16:36 um because yeah there's many ways to do
16:38 it and we took some time to kind of
16:40 experiment with some different options
16:41 and that was a that's been a larger
16:43 project over some months
16:45 with several presentations of of
16:47 insights and yeah so there's kind of
16:49 those bits of work that aren't
16:51 necessarily
16:52 um we're not necessarily working
16:53 directly for an individual product
16:55 manager but yeah working on wider pieces
16:57 of
16:59 um analysis and insight that's
17:01 beneficial kind of for the for the
17:03 company as a whole
17:10 um I just wanted to add the yeah we've
17:12 also recently started doing a few small
17:13 data science projects in the team just
17:16 on the side
17:18 um which I myself am not directly
17:19 involved with but one of my colleagues
17:21 is yeah we're trying to basically
17:25 um
17:27 um run some NLP
17:30 um uh models on basically trying to
17:32 improve how we understand basically
17:35 queries and that our users make and try
17:37 and essentially to build better query
17:39 categorization so we can ultimately
17:42 serve better results and that's been
17:44 really nice that we've been able to kind
17:46 of pick up some more yeah data sciency
17:49 topics in the team and not kind of work
17:51 exclusively on sort of um yeah sort of
17:55 reporting and um
17:57 yeah internal and this query
18:01 understanding is it's about
18:02 understanding intent right so why a user
18:05 is searching some information like do
18:07 they want you can like navigate to a
18:10 certain website do they want to get some
18:12 information do they want to buy
18:13 something yeah exactly specifically it's
18:16 around kind of being able to segment
18:19 various queries into the correct
18:21 categories so it does this query or you
18:25 know query group fall into the category
18:27 of travel or shopping or
18:31 um transport or yeah Etc it's a
18:34 different kind of categorization and
18:36 when you're describing what kind of
18:39 Duties you have what kind of things you
18:41 work on so mentioned that you're working
18:44 on kpis dashboards or like like what
18:49 else was there experiments supporting
18:51 product teams with experiments
18:53 um
18:54 ad hoc analytics and then you mentioned
18:57 a data model so up to the data model I
19:00 think I understood more or less what you
19:02 were doing but what is uh what is data
19:04 model why do we need to build a data
19:05 model why do we need to update it so we
19:08 have a
19:09 um
19:10 we've built uh they don't roll in DBT
19:12 based on something called The Domain
19:15 mode a domain model so we began
19:19 um
19:20 basically uh two two or so years ago
19:24 maybe even longer now we migrated from
19:27 uh to to DBT
19:29 and in that moment we basically re-wrote
19:34 um all our uh basically queries and to
19:38 build all our tables or the whole data
19:40 model was rebuilt from scratch
19:42 um because yeah it had evolved over time
19:44 so we had something like six install
19:46 tables um or something like ridiculous
19:48 they're just six foot tables in the
19:51 store yeah like tables the six data
19:55 model is about describing what kind of
19:57 data you have like all this schema
19:59 definitions oh yeah okay sorry yeah so
20:01 for the data model what I mean is kind
20:03 of the
20:04 what we have in DBT essentially is all
20:07 of our different
20:08 um
20:08 uh transformation Logic for the entire
20:12 um business so from uh from the most
20:15 basic sort of staging layer through down
20:17 to the presentation
20:19 um tables that we then
20:22 um
20:23 yeah use for analysis
20:26 um
20:27 yeah I if you wanted to finish right
20:31 though no go for it
20:33 yeah so I was just trying to understand
20:36 what kind of tools you use so you
20:38 mentioned three tools already so you
20:40 mentioned snowplow right so snowplow is
20:42 a two for tracking right so to
20:44 understand what kind of actions users
20:46 perform and Save in these sections right
20:49 then you also mentioned DBT which is a
20:51 tool for transformation right so you
20:53 have some data sitting somewhere and you
20:55 need to
20:57 um we will change it slightly it worked
21:00 like uh aggregate rights and then put it
21:02 in such a form that you can use
21:05 for reports right and you also have DB
21:07 looker looker is a tool for uh
21:10 dashboards right what else do you use so
21:12 probably use some sort of database a
21:14 database right maybe some other tools
21:17 too yeah exactly so we use
21:20 um we use
21:21 um yeah AWS services so we use S3 and
21:24 redshift
21:26 um and also Spectrum as well
21:29 um you have to query
21:31 um yeah Athena so we really uh we play
21:35 around a lot with yeah so-called Hot and
21:37 Cold Storage so keeping data in redshift
21:40 versus keeping it in S3 in parquet files
21:43 um that's due to cost optimization
21:47 um so yeah that's what we use for our
21:49 Lake um Warehouse
21:51 um and then we use um airflow as well as
21:54 our orchestration tool
21:56 um and uh yeah for our
22:00 um extracting and loading potions was it
22:04 a part of your job to set up all these
22:06 tools
22:08 um it was part of my job to set up DBT
22:10 yes
22:11 um so that was one of the first big
22:13 projects
22:14 um so I'd been in the team for maybe six
22:16 months or so and then we began the
22:18 migration to DBT
22:20 and we actually worked with a data
22:22 consultancy
22:23 um a small one to just help us because
22:26 yeah we were essentially three people
22:28 um
22:29 and my yeah I led that project
22:33 um was one of my first big projects
22:36 um which was great it was a really big
22:37 learning curve and I got to learn yeah
22:39 not only about yeah DBT the tool itself
22:41 but also data modeling Theory and
22:44 practices in different ways of uh doing
22:47 things what makes sense depending on the
22:49 size of your data and your goals and
22:52 needs that was really great
22:54 um
22:55 yeah so DBT is is the main one looker as
22:58 well as I mentioned I helped to to
23:00 um
23:01 to
23:03 migrate to and Implement for the company
23:06 it was before you actually joined the
23:08 item right so yeah you started as a in
23:11 marketing looking at this before
23:12 actually strangely learned like lukamel
23:14 before I learned SQL which is a slightly
23:17 strange I think way of doing things
23:19 there we go that's how it happened
23:22 um yeah an airflow
23:24 um was
23:26 um set up by our my colleague who is uh
23:30 has more of a data engineering role
23:31 within the team
23:33 um and that was also set up relatively
23:36 uh relatively recent in the last like
23:39 two three years or so
23:41 um yeah those are the main uh tools
23:43 we've recently started using air byte
23:47 um that some people might be familiar
23:48 with to
23:49 yeah basically be able to extract from
23:53 some kind of common apis and data
23:56 sources
23:57 um we haven't used it extensively so far
23:59 we often find that
24:00 got a lot of options but specifically
24:02 what we need
24:03 um often that doesn't necessarily have
24:05 the connection yet but been a it's a
24:08 nice I think it's a nice tool relatively
24:10 easy to use
24:12 um and we've also recently started using
24:13 redash which is like an open source
24:15 visualization tool that we use for more
24:17 like ad hoc
24:18 queries that yeah to be able to have a
24:21 visualization attached to them
24:24 um as well
24:25 it seems like most of the tools are open
24:27 source they're all apart from AWS right
24:29 I don't know about Lookers look at open
24:32 source no no but the rest are right so
24:35 snowplow is open source DBT is open
24:37 source air byte is open source reduction
24:41 is open source as well
24:44 yeah so you you like open source don't
24:46 you yes
24:49 yes exactly do you host all these things
24:52 yourself or like for example when it
24:54 comes to DBT you use their Cloud no we
24:57 host everything ourselves
25:00 yep that's just a general decision of
25:02 the engineering department decision
25:06 and when you joined the pi team was your
25:09 already called analytics engineer or you
25:12 just over time realize that okay this is
25:14 how I should call myself
25:17 um well my official role is analytics
25:18 engineer and data analyst because I
25:20 really do both
25:22 um we're not the size of a bi team that
25:24 it's possible for someone to do just one
25:27 too much to do
25:29 um role but I think initially it was I
25:31 don't know what the title was initially
25:33 bi analyst or something data analyst and
25:36 then I think
25:37 at that point even the the term
25:40 analytics engineer really wasn't
25:42 common I think I really only learned
25:45 about that in the process of
25:47 implementing DBT which was in 2020 so
25:52 yeah really sometime has passed I think
25:55 since
25:56 the deputies have obviously become huge
25:59 um in the data community and I think
26:01 this role of an engineer is becoming
26:03 also much more common but I think at the
26:06 time when I joined the team that wasn't
26:07 even a
26:09 um an option I think I don't think
26:12 anyone even
26:13 um thought of that I don't think the
26:15 people in the bi team were actually
26:16 calling themselves that themselves even
26:18 though that's essentially the job they
26:20 were doing
26:21 um so yeah over time as we all
26:24 um became familiar with that new term
26:26 and realized that it basically described
26:28 what we were doing
26:31 um yeah then
26:32 that was um yeah taken on do you think
26:36 there's some hype in uh in that role I
26:39 mean that it's uh there was no such
26:42 thing and now then all of a sudden
26:43 everyone's talking about analytics
26:46 yeah I think to be honest I think
26:49 there's if you're talking if you have a
26:52 small bi team
26:54 um you know I think
26:56 you know six or less people in the team
26:59 I mean I guess depending on your on your
27:01 on your company and your product and the
27:03 business
27:04 um business model but I think
27:07 it's a little bit overhyped I mean
27:08 ultimately
27:10 I still think that you need quite a
27:13 large organization to be able to
27:14 comfortably segment data analysts and
27:17 analytics engineer they have so much
27:19 crossover anyway I can see that in
27:21 larger organizations it's really helpful
27:23 to have the separation but I think in
27:25 smaller ones it's not so
27:29 um and it's in my experience which is
27:31 yeah simply this is one company
27:34 um can't speak for others I found that
27:37 it's uh it's helpful in terms of
27:40 your own personal progress because you
27:43 can sort of align yourself with this
27:45 role and say okay yes this is this is
27:47 what I do this is somewhere where I
27:48 could improve and an area that yeah I
27:52 could spend more time on but I'm not
27:54 necessarily shh yeah I think for most
27:58 kind of small medium-sized companies I
28:00 don't think it's necessary to get really
28:01 bogged down into the differences between
28:04 the two because ultimately
28:07 you're still going to need very
28:09 overlapping skills like you need to be
28:11 very analytical very comfortable with
28:13 your kpis what the business model is the
28:15 domain model all of that work which is
28:17 not limited to analysis engineering good
28:20 data analyst needs all of those things
28:21 more so
28:23 um yeah I think there's maybe a little
28:25 bit of of hype but again as I said it
28:26 depends on the on the on the
28:28 organization side if you have a huge
28:30 company where the data or Department of
28:33 20 30 40 people then of course like it
28:35 it just makes like structural sense to
28:37 to split out and focus
28:40 do you think it is a synonym like it's
28:43 synonymous to
28:45 uh using DPT like you use DPT data for
28:49 your analytics engineer and if you use
28:51 if you're an analytics engineer then you
28:53 use DVT like uh are they the same thing
28:56 or you can't be an analytics engineer
28:58 without using DPT it's a good question I
29:01 mean I feel like the
29:03 DVT themselves have really promoted this
29:06 I think yeah
29:08 exactly so you know
29:12 in a way I think yeah it kind of is
29:15 synonymous like I don't I at least
29:17 haven't seen many job applications for
29:20 analytics engineer that haven't been
29:22 like your job is to work with TBT so I
29:26 mean I'd be interested to kind of
29:28 see how whether that yeah how that role
29:31 could look with a different
29:33 um stack and I imagine there are people
29:38 who are working under the title of data
29:40 engineer or data analyst to you know do
29:44 the work of an artist's engineer but
29:45 just don't call themselves that in in
29:47 other companies that maybe don't use it
29:48 because in the company where I work we
29:51 don't have DPT we have a homegrown DBT
29:54 kind of uh
29:56 replacement but it was before DBT was
29:59 popular right yeah so as many other
30:01 companies we kind of invented DBT which
30:03 is like airflow based way to schedule
30:06 CCO queries right
30:09 um I don't think we none of our analysts
30:12 who use this to call themselves
30:14 analytics engineers
30:16 so I'm wondering are there any tools
30:19 that are doing the same thing as DBT
30:21 apart from these homegrown tools like we
30:24 have or are there any such things on the
30:26 market
30:27 I don't know
30:29 um to be honest I haven't had the time
30:33 to really look in I mean I think at the
30:36 moment DBT is on such a gross trajectory
30:38 as being I see so many yeah
30:42 job up job ads for looking for people to
30:45 help them set up DBT and
30:47 I think it's really taking off so I
30:49 don't personally know but I I do
30:53 you know like you said we were
30:54 previously using SQL Runner which is
30:56 like snow plows kind of similar and
30:58 um is that exactly what you described
31:00 basically in the orchestration tool for
31:02 SQL queries
31:03 um
31:04 well yeah you can specify the order and
31:06 whatnot and yeah incrementalization
31:09 strategies were not invented by DBT
31:11 there's there's many ways to
31:13 to to set those up
31:16 um in those other kind of setups
31:19 um
31:20 so I think that for me and his
31:22 engineering
31:24 I think where for me the focus there is
31:27 on which for example with the data
31:28 analyst perhaps is not so much the focus
31:30 is really around
31:32 I guess the The Wider architecture right
31:35 of the data model for me that's where
31:37 the analytics engineering role is really
31:41 is really important it's once you start
31:44 collecting you know there is different
31:46 data sources you have you know all of
31:49 these issues around
31:50 uh consistency and um yeah of course
31:54 freshness and all of these various
31:56 concerns I think that
31:58 this is where an analytics engineer
32:00 really needs to shine is to understand
32:03 how everything fits together in this
32:05 wider ecosystem which
32:08 um perhaps an analyst might know you
32:10 know doesn't necessarily need to
32:12 understand like the full
32:15 um
32:16 all the Transformations and how
32:17 everything connects to each other but an
32:20 analytics engineer really really does so
32:22 I think this kind of focus on data
32:25 modeling like theory is much more
32:28 important
32:30 um so I think in that way it's kind of
32:32 slightly more like a theoretical role in
32:34 many ways which I think is often not
32:36 really talked about
32:37 um it's often like Technic like
32:39 circumstance like technical which which
32:42 it is but I think that
32:44 I think it's really important to
32:46 understand as an analytics engineer the
32:48 different kind of data modeling
32:49 Frameworks and what's possible and
32:52 um you know
32:54 whether having a you know wider table or
32:57 a narrower table like why when in which
32:59 case should you go for one versus the
33:02 other
33:03 um when should you choose a certain kind
33:05 of incrementalization when not
33:07 um strategy and
33:09 so I think that's that's kind of the
33:11 part of the the role that I think is
33:14 probably
33:15 uh
33:16 yeah very specific and
33:19 I guess becoming more and more important
33:22 just as there is so much more data that
33:24 companies in general are collecting so
33:25 by virtue of
33:27 more companies smaller companies
33:30 different kinds of companies in the
33:31 traditional kind of big Enterprises
33:33 start using and collecting data and
33:35 building up data departments then of
33:38 course like this becomes more of a need
33:41 um
33:42 I think
33:45 I'm curious about this data modeling
33:48 theory that you mentioned and selecting
33:51 like whether it should be a white table
33:52 it should be narrow table
33:54 if I wanted to learn more about this
33:57 where do I go what kind of resources do
34:00 I have about this this is a good
34:02 question I think I really uh struggled a
34:05 little bit with this because there's
34:05 really a lot of
34:07 there's a lot of quite I wouldn't even
34:09 call it advanced stuff but the textbooks
34:12 and and that you can buy on like datum I
34:15 have this very dry like I'll just be
34:17 honest gimbal right
34:19 like there's loads of textbooks
34:21 something I think I studied at
34:23 University but never actually saw this
34:25 book outside of University exactly I had
34:28 to be honest I I I've given a good I've
34:30 given them a good and I found that
34:34 I just learned by doing I learned
34:36 through talking to to people who'd who
34:40 yeah but yeah my mentors or senior and
34:45 who are experts and I just asked as many
34:48 questions as I could and never afraid to
34:51 just ask stupid questions and repeat
34:53 questions if I needed to until until it
34:56 made sense and then sometimes if I had
34:57 the basic knowledge I had something that
34:59 I wanted to understand I would go and
35:00 just research online and there are a lot
35:03 of good
35:04 um increasingly actually a lot of really
35:06 good like blog posts
35:08 um
35:10 um newsletters
35:11 um
35:12 that are available and I think
35:14 increasingly there are more and more
35:15 resources that are a lot more like
35:17 accessible and for people who haven't
35:19 necessarily studied like computer
35:21 science or like data science or
35:24 um statistics or these sorts of subjects
35:27 at University you didn't study that
35:29 right you do no I studied Classics which
35:33 is Latin and ancient Greek
35:35 that was your medication that was my
35:39 bachelor yeah
35:41 you speaking Greek and Latin no I I read
35:46 I can read it
35:48 interesting okay that this just made our
35:52 interview even more interesting
35:55 like how do you go from you know uh
35:59 studying ancient Greek and a lighting to
36:02 being an analytics engineer so you
36:03 learned basically everything you needed
36:06 yourself right yeah exactly so by
36:09 yourself I mean not as a part of any
36:12 official curriculum yeah I did a um to
36:16 be honest I did this
36:18 SQL course on udemy that cost me 12
36:22 euros and it was great it was really
36:24 really good it was quite long
36:27 um but the the guy I can't remember I
36:30 think it was just call it the complete
36:31 guide to Sequel and it's run by this
36:33 American dude called Colt steel it was
36:36 just a very strange name he's got loads
36:37 of he's got like a good python course as
36:39 well that I did
36:40 and I just did that in my spare time and
36:42 to be honest I was just it was really
36:45 great that it was cost me all of 12
36:46 euros and I haven't done a single other
36:48 SQL course
36:49 um since
36:51 um so I do sometimes
36:54 sometimes I do like think oh like should
36:58 I go and pay for one of these like fancy
37:00 courses and like data science or
37:02 something
37:03 um because it's nice to kind of have
37:05 structure and and whatnot but then I'm
37:07 like if I just motivated myself I could
37:10 do it for something too bad
37:12 uh there's so much stuff online
37:15 um but it's just the case of I think I
37:16 was quite lucky to find a good course
37:18 right away I think there are some not
37:20 very good courses out there but
37:22 um so it's a little bit of Hit and Miss
37:24 but I think that's one thing that's
37:26 really great about
37:28 um well I guess software engineering in
37:30 general and computer science is that you
37:32 if you don't have a lot of resources you
37:34 can really teach yourself and there's a
37:36 lot of
37:37 um resource online but at the same time
37:39 as I said like practicing is really the
37:41 thing that makes the difference and I
37:43 was very lucky that I was already at a
37:46 company that I knew the domain like very
37:48 well business model very well kpis so
37:52 I kind of had all of that already
37:53 covered
37:54 um and could just focus on developing
37:56 like the SQL skills and data modeling
38:00 Etc
38:00 I can imagine that someone who is maybe
38:03 approaching this as a career change
38:05 um and maybe taking some time out to do
38:08 it
38:08 it's a little bit more difficult because
38:10 you don't have that context of a
38:13 specific business or a specific
38:15 uh problem or
38:17 um yeah that you can kind of
38:19 hold in your mind as you think about
38:21 these problems and have an example that
38:24 you can apply
38:25 and apply the theory to
38:27 yeah there is a thing called
38:28 just-in-time learning and I think you
38:30 took this to to the extreme right so
38:32 without any formal education in computer
38:35 science or analytics you just focused on
38:38 a specific problem which in your case
38:39 was marketing right and then okay like
38:41 how do I I don't know set up looker to
38:45 do this thing by the way do you are your
38:48 tasks that you do now are they still
38:50 more or less related to marketing so you
38:52 mentioned this rfm analysis right I
38:55 think it's still somewhat related right
38:59 um not really to be honest no I think at
39:01 the moment I'm really working very
39:03 closely with the product teams so it's
39:06 really around but you know eventually
39:07 ultimately
39:09 um yeah we are focusing on yeah growing
39:14 um acquiring more users attending more
39:16 users which are all of course
39:17 interlinked
39:19 um goals of the marketing team so
39:20 nothing is not super
39:24 um not not directly relevant but yeah my
39:26 stake my direct stakeholders are the
39:28 product managers
39:30 okay so I guess your
39:33 background in marketing really helped
39:36 you yeah it really really it really did
39:39 um I really really noticed how
39:43 just in everyday work I really think
39:46 that I had I do there I definitely see
39:49 an edge
39:50 um that I have because I'm very
39:52 comfortable with the
39:54 you know things like a marketing funnel
39:56 and um a conversion funnel a web
39:59 acquisition funnel these are things that
40:01 for example a product manager might be
40:03 focusing specifically on a on a part of
40:05 a funnel or a whole funnel uh as part of
40:08 the user Journey
40:10 and as a marketing person you kind of
40:13 think about the user Journey all the
40:15 time you know what are the touch points
40:16 of the user how do they feel at this
40:18 moment what are they thinking at this
40:19 moment what have they done where have
40:20 they come from so you I kind of you have
40:24 this
40:25 quite close
40:27 um
40:28 I guess empathy with the with the user
40:31 and specifically the journey but at the
40:32 same time your goal is marketing up to
40:34 kind of you know constantly optimize and
40:36 grow and get more users or higher
40:39 retention or
40:40 um you know more signups or whatever it
40:42 might might be so you have this mindset
40:44 as well this growth mindset and that I
40:47 think is a is very useful when you come
40:50 to advising uh people from like a data
40:53 point of view because you can ask the
40:55 question like okay but yes you've got
40:57 some good feedback from the users on
40:58 this feature but
41:01 um you know ultimately the Top Line
41:03 hasn't like moved at all and we we did
41:05 this because we wanted to grow you know
41:07 whatever this kpi is so I think it um
41:11 yeah it definitely does does help
41:14 largely in the in the realm of like
41:16 understanding the user journey and it
41:18 means that you can
41:19 you can really hold in your head like
41:21 this user
41:23 um perspective but also the data
41:24 perspective together and like kind of
41:26 advise with those two things in your
41:28 head
41:30 and if somebody wants to follow your
41:33 journey if somebody's working in
41:35 marketing or maybe not necessarily
41:38 marketing but they really want to go
41:40 into data and to start doing analytics
41:42 engineering
41:43 and they are domain experts in their
41:46 domain right so what kind of thing would
41:48 you suggest them to do
41:50 so firstly I would say
41:52 um
41:53 Excel is your best friend I mean
41:56 Excel is great ultimately it doesn't get
41:59 I mean I know everyone hates it but it
42:01 really doesn't get the credits
42:04 I mean I still have people in the
42:06 company who really
42:09 um should and don't know how to use it
42:11 make a pivot table and they are quite
42:13 annoying to make in Excel like the most
42:15 difficult pivot table you make will be
42:17 an Excel if you can do it there and be
42:19 comfortable understand what's happening
42:22 with columns and rows
42:24 it's that's the first place to go so be
42:27 really really comfortable with Excel
42:28 play around with functions
42:30 um pivot tables
42:33 um
42:34 just explore explore it looking at
42:37 different ways of trying to you know
42:39 take a data set that you feel
42:40 comfortable with it might just be
42:41 something that's really simple like
42:43 daily sign ups and by country and just
42:48 in Excel stop playing around with that
42:51 and asking questions and then of course
42:52 SQL the most important thing
42:55 um learn SQL try and find online there
42:59 are some data sets that you can play
43:00 around with and kind of practice the
43:02 sequel and
43:04 that's really really useful
43:07 um
43:08 But ultimately I think what
43:11 where I found a little bit of a gap in
43:14 the in the self learning was between the
43:16 online SQL resources and like
43:19 finding like Advanced SQL queries that
43:24 made sense that weren't written by
43:26 someone outside the world about a
43:28 company that had no connection to didn't
43:30 understand a business model so and was
43:32 written in a way that for example wasn't
43:34 the style that was going to be written
43:35 in my team so it ended up just being a
43:37 little bit
43:38 confusing and extra work to try and
43:41 understand so if there's a way to access
43:44 like some of the SQL codes the vit were
43:46 using maybe you can ask them to share
43:48 like you know
43:50 a couple of
43:52 um SQL queries they use to make the main
43:54 tables or
43:55 that's definitely something to to do if
43:59 your company is using looker there's a
44:01 great
44:02 um
44:02 that's amazing like to get familiar with
44:05 that really just start building building
44:07 there's some dashboards explores become
44:10 really comfortable with filtering
44:12 pivoting those sorts of things there's a
44:15 lot of resources as well online from
44:16 looker and I think also I think the
44:19 Tableau as well
44:21 um
44:22 or whatever visualization tool you're
44:23 using it doesn't really matter just I
44:25 think become comfortable with the basic
44:27 basic kind of features of those
44:30 um yeah those would be the main things I
44:32 think and then go from there I think
44:33 also find someone who can be your if not
44:37 mental kind of your Champion or someone
44:40 that you can uh
44:43 uh an ally I guess in the data team and
44:46 ask them you know what what do you what
44:48 do I need to do what uh what skills are
44:52 still missing how do I do them like do
44:54 you think it's possible ask them what
44:55 they would
44:57 um
44:57 recommend if you're in an existing
45:00 company and you're looking to move to
45:01 that department
45:03 um
45:04 yeah I think that would be kind of my
45:07 that's the job
45:08 how important do you think to have this
45:10 Mentor or champion in this journey like
45:14 for you from what I understood it was
45:16 quite important it was crucial right
45:18 that person it was a marketing analyst
45:21 if I remember correct that actually
45:22 helped you like she said you what she
45:26 told you what you should do like what
45:27 kind of things you should focus on and
45:29 then she also was helpful for you to
45:32 actually transition to the team exactly
45:34 she was um she was the B she was the bi
45:37 analyst the data analyst the only one
45:39 that we had at the time I I think
45:40 actually sorry had two people in the
45:42 data team she was one of them
45:45 um for me it was very useful and
45:47 important I think to be honest though it
45:49 depends
45:51 it depends on on the company your
45:53 position in the company how comfortable
45:55 you feel what level of kind of like
45:57 power so to speak you have in the
45:59 company
46:00 um and also I mean for me as a woman I
46:04 think you know transitioning from
46:06 marketing into
46:08 a more technical
46:11 um role I was going to move to the
46:12 engineering department
46:14 there was immediately I felt an element
46:17 of I don't know a lot of uh what's the
46:20 word
46:21 um
46:22 uh
46:25 the syndrome imposter imposter syndrome
46:27 I thought oh what am I doing like can I
46:29 really do this and I think it really
46:30 helped me to have another
46:33 um yeah a female basically
46:37 um a mentor to
46:40 um
46:41 to kind of Champion me and encourage me
46:44 and say yeah you can do this like
46:46 definitely you can do this like you just
46:47 need to do this and this and like you
46:49 can definitely do that once you've done
46:50 that like come and we can find a way so
46:53 it depends I think if you have a lot of
46:55 motivation then you're very clear on
46:57 what you want and you're confident
47:00 um then I don't think it's necessarily
47:02 needed but particularly for minorities
47:07 um
47:08 especially I think also in um
47:11 there's a lot of kind of
47:14 um support groups like outside of like
47:17 uh you know those pie ladies and lots of
47:19 different um uh various support groups
47:22 and minorities in Tech which are great
47:24 to be inspired by but I think having
47:27 that one person in your company
47:29 uh who you can relate to
47:32 um Can can be really helpful just in
47:34 terms of building up your own confidence
47:37 um and it's definitely something that
47:39 helped me also to not just transition
47:42 into the team but you know once I was in
47:45 the team kind of accelerate quite
47:48 quickly because yes I was Junior when I
47:51 joined but my career path up to being a
47:55 mid-level
47:56 analyst and now sort of intern team lead
47:58 was a lot quicker because
48:00 I had to fight and be like well I have
48:02 been doing analytics work for years
48:04 before I haven't actually picked all of
48:06 this up from
48:07 scratch and sort of having to like
48:09 have the confidence to to make that
48:12 clear and argue it and
48:14 um yeah it was really helpful having
48:16 someone to basically Champion so I would
48:18 recommend finding one person in that
48:20 company who can kind of be that for you
48:24 yeah did you did you take any
48:27 did you take part in any of this support
48:29 group that you mentioned like Pilates or
48:31 did you have mentors or people who you
48:34 constantly talk to outside of the
48:36 company or it was mostly the person and
48:39 the rest of the team that you
48:41 um talk to to learn yeah
48:44 in my case it was mainly
48:47 um my two two teammates
48:50 um who were the bi team when I joined
48:52 they were incredible so supportive they
48:55 really
48:56 um encouraged me a lot and yeah have
48:59 helped me hugely I'm very excited for me
49:01 to join and the team and yeah and made
49:06 me feel very welcome and like I deserved
49:09 to be there which was uh yeah very
49:11 useful because at times I was like oh
49:13 what am I doing it like is this too hard
49:16 um
49:17 but in terms of externals but not really
49:19 to be honest I had a few friends who
49:22 also worked in
49:24 um two very close friends who worked in
49:26 data who yeah it was nice to talk to
49:29 them and have their advice as well and
49:30 have different perspectives from
49:32 different companies which I think is
49:34 something that
49:35 um particularly as someone who's been at
49:37 a company for a very long time I
49:38 definitely feel the need to speak to
49:41 people in different places and see like
49:43 oh is it also like this where you work
49:44 or like is this a specific issue like
49:48 just that we're facing or is this a
49:50 general thing and having that
49:52 perspective has also been really useful
49:54 um in order to just sort of like
49:55 Benchmark certain issues that you come
49:58 across
50:00 um so yeah I wish I actually had I think
50:02 having a few more external I think
50:06 um
50:07 mentors or support would would be yeah
50:11 great I think probably in the coming
50:12 year I'll probably look for a mentor
50:15 um just to
50:16 to kind of help with like kicking off
50:19 the next phase the development but yeah
50:22 let's see do you have any ideas where
50:24 you can look for this sort of mentors
50:27 like would it be conferences meetup
50:29 groups or I don't know some place online
50:31 yeah probably a combination of LinkedIn
50:37 um I mean faster than the networks
50:39 they're asking yeah asking people that I
50:42 know if they have anyone they recommend
50:44 and then yeah meetups as well I think is
50:46 probably the a good way to go
50:49 is there an analytics engineer
50:53 engineering Meetup in Berlin
50:56 I'm not sure there's definitely like a
50:58 snow plow
51:00 um Meetup I think has just started up
51:02 again we're about to
51:05 um
51:06 then yeah in terms of engineering I'm
51:10 not sure to be honest I don't
51:13 then things I know there are some data
51:15 meetups
51:16 um I'm not sure if they're specifically
51:18 analytics engineering
51:20 um I have kept an eye open on silai on
51:23 the DBT slack Group which is extensive
51:27 and actually great
51:30 um yeah they have like uh some City
51:33 specific groups and Berlin has yet to uh
51:36 I think make its appearance so perhaps
51:37 in the future there might be like a DBT
51:40 Berlin yeah I think there should be so
51:43 one of the people who helped me with the
51:46 questions is Victoria so Victoria was a
51:48 guest on this podcast like more than a
51:50 year ago and now she works at DBT and I
51:53 think she is she is or will be
51:55 organizing something soon I think maybe
51:58 maybe she will tell us
52:01 um I see that it's almost
52:04 yeah it's almost time to finish so I
52:07 wanted to ask you last one last thing so
52:10 you mentioned that you are subscribed to
52:12 some new starters so there are good blog
52:14 posts good newsletters and these
52:17 newsletters are quite useful for you
52:19 what kind of newsletters are you
52:21 subscribed to so if I want to
52:24 um keep an eye on what's happening in
52:26 this in this area what kind of
52:28 newsletters a do I subscribe to
52:32 uh it's a good question there's one I
52:33 think I'm subscribed to uh analytics
52:36 engineering one that's called like the
52:38 route I think I think it might be the
52:40 DBT one I think it's called like the
52:41 Roundup or something
52:44 analytics engineering Roundup
52:48 um I think it's
52:49 I think it's I think it might be the DBT
52:51 actually newsletter I think
52:55 um there's another one I just subscribed
52:57 to like a week or two ago that's called
53:01 um Lenny's newsletter
53:04 um Lenny's newsletter so it's Lenny is
53:06 the name of the person yeah double NY
53:10 um and I don't
53:13 um I've only just subscribed to it
53:14 recently I think it was slightly more
53:15 like kind of product
53:17 um analytics Focus
53:20 um and then the
53:23 there is a Blog that I'm sure most of
53:27 your readers will know I've just
53:28 forgotten the name of it it's like
53:31 it's got a like profoundly optimistic or
53:34 something it's called locally locally
53:36 optimistic yeah
53:38 that one yeah they have us like coming
53:39 into yeah yeah that um yeah sometimes
53:44 the time I'll check that that profoundly
53:47 optimistic is also a good name yeah
53:50 I think
53:53 okay so if somebody has questions uh for
53:57 you how can they find you is it LinkedIn
53:59 or you have some other well there are
54:02 some other ways to contact you
