4:16 yes at the moment yes yes so welcome to
4:21 our
4:22 interview nice to see you nice to see
4:25 you again I hope you have your soilent
4:27 with you
4:30 it's um was it soilent right it was um
4:35 wood wood yeah that's the brand that
4:37 they have here the meal replacement
4:39 because how we met right yeah that's how
4:43 we met yeah so there like for background
4:46 so this is how we met so there was a
4:49 Meetup uh I think it was actually Co
4:51 organized by data talks Club but the
4:53 only thing we did to co-organize the
4:55 event is place our logo there it was
4:57 mostly done by DT Hub which is M which
5:01 bought
5:02 food what else they provided the
5:07 office and food and drinks very
5:10 important Yeah so basically they did the
5:12 whole thing and they just asked me to
5:14 show up like how can I say no to that
5:16 right yeah and it was so funny because I
5:18 knew about data talks and after the
5:21 event I was like wait a second is this
5:23 person that I met actually from
5:26 dat yeah yeah so it was a bit noisy
5:29 there
5:30 like um they have a how do you call it a
5:34 room for meetups right it's not the
5:38 largest room for meetups and when many
5:40 people start speaking there it gets loud
5:43 so of course I was trying to hide in a
5:47 CL room and then there was Sabina also
5:50 hiding and um yeah I had this woot
5:54 bottle which is like a meal
5:56 replacement uh it's just you drink and
5:59 it has like 500 calories and then your
6:03 comment was like I'm more like a he
6:05 person heal person yeah because I was
6:08 very into meal replacement at some point
6:10 like I drank hu for lunch every single
6:14 day ah so it was that uh
6:18 into yeah yeah I mean I still have like
6:22 hu at home but I just find it difficult
6:25 to have it nowadays on a regular basis
6:27 otherwise I would still love to have
6:29 it's great like time saer mhm yeah I
6:34 just drink it after gym usually or when
6:36 I don't have enough like I I I want to
6:39 consume a certain amount of protein per
6:41 day and when I don't uh hit the number
6:44 so then I just drink this cuz like they
6:47 have a lot of protein anyways so this is
6:50 how we met then we got we talked a
6:53 little bit about sabina's work and that
6:55 was pretty interesting so when we
6:57 connected later on LinkedIn I thought
6:59 but I have to interview her so that's
7:03 why we're here talking
7:05 today and yeah as always the questions
7:08 for today's interview are prepared by
7:10 Johanna Bayer thanks Johanna for your
7:12 help so let's start
7:16 and before we go into our main topic we
7:20 start with your background can I can you
7:23 tell us about your career Journey so
7:25 far yeah I think the bio was quite uh
7:29 well put already like I've been in the
7:34 work workplace for very little time but
7:37 I've already had quite a few career
7:39 switches um so yeah I started I studied
7:43 um chemistry at the University of
7:45 Cambridge started off with natural
7:47 sciences and then specialized in organic
7:50 chemistry afterwards I decided that uh
7:53 lab work was not really my thing I was
7:56 think I much more preferred the thinking
8:00 work of organic chemistry compared to
8:02 the grunt work of doing experiments and
8:06 working in the wet lab so then I thought
8:09 that I would like to do uh something
8:12 either in Consulting but then this
8:14 opportunity appeared to work as a data
8:16 analyst in tenie and I had to take it
8:19 because it's uh quite rare to get to
8:22 work on something very interesting also
8:26 for Mission driven companies and also in
8:28 a lovely place to live in yeah and then
8:32 from Finance I realized I didn't like
8:36 Excel that much I didn't want to work
8:38 all of my life in Excel it wasn't really
8:40 my thing I was very keen on python since
8:43 the pandemic I got like I'm not sure if
8:46 you know about hypers skill but uh
8:49 they're super
8:50 cool yeah so but you know about Jud
8:53 brains by any chance brains yeah yeah so
8:56 like they've worked with hypers skill on
8:58 creating uh this learning platform for
9:01 Python and lots of other programming
9:03 languages and I think it's one of the
9:04 best I've seen and that's how I started
9:06 learning Python and I knew I likeed
9:09 scale right hypers skill skill ah H
9:13 hypers skill yeah I highly recommend it
9:16 it is quite pricey but I think they
9:18 offer a lot of value as well um yeah so
9:22 I started learning Python and I thought
9:25 hey I mean I've already worked in data
9:27 analysis in finance and I already like
9:29 know a bit of programming and then I
9:32 sort of went for iron hack like um and
9:36 study data analytics with them and since
9:39 I've been taking data analytics
9:42 positions switch to freelancing because
9:44 I find it more suited to my interest I
9:49 like dipping my toes into multiple
9:52 fields and yeah right now my main focus
9:56 is Frontline 100 because I think the
9:58 work that we do is very important and
10:02 very impactful and I really really love
10:04 it I think obviously the topic is quite
10:07 heavy so saying it very enthusiastically
10:10 might come across as weird but I think I
10:13 really love having the opportunity to
10:15 contribute to such a
10:18 topic and right now I want to ask you of
10:21 course the topic but I want to give a
10:23 warning a disclaimer not a disclaimer
10:26 probably a warning would be a better
10:27 word the that TW we are going to talk
10:30 about a sensitive topic which is
10:33 domestic abuse and
10:35 violence um and if you know somebody who
10:39 is experiencing domestic abuse you
10:42 should seek for help and if you live in
10:44 Germany there is a national helpl line
10:47 available at
10:50 11616 and if you live somewhere else
10:53 please find a number to contact and um I
10:58 think this is an important topic that's
10:59 why when I heard about what Sabina is
11:01 doing I have not heard about AI
11:04 applications to that topic so that's why
11:07 we're here I wanted to talk about that
11:09 so yeah please tell us about Frontline
11:12 100 and what you're trying to
11:15 solve right so well the main purpose of
11:19 Frontline 100 is to end domestic abuse
11:22 sooner and as you very correctly pointed
11:25 out AI in this field is not something
11:28 that's quite very common which is why uh
11:32 what we're bringing to domestic abuse uh
11:38 prevention is quite relevant most of the
11:42 domestic abuse risk Assessments in the
11:44 field are on paper only so I think that
11:49 having um an AI tool involved in this
11:52 especially with all of the hype around
11:54 Ai and having in general
11:57 um an application
11:59 of AI into social issues is very
12:02 relevant so I was very excited when I
12:05 first saw the Frontline website I was
12:07 like this is incredible like I've never
12:09 thought of using uh AI for such a cause
12:13 so I was very excited from the
12:16 GetGo how did you find them or did they
12:19 find
12:20 you it's very funny because I found them
12:24 through a telegram group so one of the
12:27 previous uh data scientist Joy like he
12:32 uh po posted in Te like the computer
12:37 science University alumni telegram group
12:41 and then uh yeah
12:44 my one of my friends who also studied at
12:48 sent me this
12:51 uh this job job post and I was like wow
12:54 this is incredible this is exactly what
12:56 I want because I was looking for many
12:58 positions at the time so it's yeah was
13:01 very fun I usually well I'm not actively
13:06 looking for a job but sometimes I come
13:08 across different uh job descriptions
13:11 positions typically it's in L on
13:13 LinkedIn and usually it's like
13:16 e-commerce or you know internet
13:19 companies like at Tech or marketing or
13:24 like the the the usual thing right so I
13:27 don't typically come across
13:29 social initiatives like that one so yeah
13:32 it's pretty interesting like how people
13:35 can find it like uh for example if I
13:38 want to also contribute to a similar
13:41 project where would you suggest to find
13:44 for jobs in this
13:46 area to be fair what I started doing now
13:49 is simply to look for organizations that
13:53 I'm interested in and see if they have
13:56 openings because I think as you said
13:59 it's very rare that you would find these
14:01 job adverts and I remember I saw one I
14:05 follow our world in data quite a lot
14:07 because they post very interesting
14:09 reports and data
14:10 visualizations um yeah and at some point
14:13 I just found a job post that was
14:16 expiring the same day so I was like okay
14:19 I have to code something now so I can
14:22 apply uh so yeah I would suggest to
14:25 actively look for organizations in the
14:28 causes that you're interested in be it
14:31 uh data transparency be it accessibility
14:33 social impact whatever and follow them
14:37 and look for updates or even uh message
14:40 them because if they're small
14:41 organizations they're more likely to
14:43 answer than if they're
14:46 bigger and uh I diverged a little bit so
14:49 we talked
14:50 about domestic abuse and he said that
14:54 it's very rare that AI is used to for
14:59 risk assessment of domestic abuse and
15:01 I'm wondering how is it done usually
15:04 like you said it's done on paper but how
15:06 exactly what is the process and what the
15:08 risk assessment of what like are they
15:10 looking at a family and think like How
15:13 likely that in this family there is this
15:17 problem like I'm trying to figure out
15:19 what's
15:20 the how to put it correctly like
15:23 typically in a usual settings I would
15:24 say business case but like it sounds
15:26 very weird to say like that here yeah
15:30 yeah a use case maybe use case yeah
15:33 right yeah so or maybe a
15:36 scenario
15:38 scenario yeah I would say like what uh
15:41 happens at the moment is um you have
15:44 victims interacting with
15:47 uh institutions be it's police be it uh
15:51 healthc care practitioners be it social
15:53 workers and um the people that they're
15:57 in contact with they usually administer
16:00 a survey which has been um studied
16:05 previously and shows High correlation
16:07 with abuse uh usually physical and
16:11 sexual abuse that's uh typically what
16:15 um is being tested uh however and it's
16:20 usually just uh about the victims
16:23 experience there have been qualitative
16:25 studies as well but it's mostly very
16:28 academ mic and what's currently used by
16:32 uh police officers in Germany and uh in
16:37 Germany it's a mixture of
16:40 um risk assessment tools that were built
16:45 in North America for people uh in that
16:49 demographic Based on data that they've
16:52 collected uh and it's used on the German
16:57 population and it's used usually yeah
17:00 administered a set of question and then
17:02 based of that whether the person is at
17:05 high risk or medium
17:08 risk but
17:10 usually so there is a victim right and
17:14 somebody is talking to them police
17:16 Healthcare uh Personnel social workers
17:20 but if the victim already approach them
17:23 they already know that there is a
17:24 problem or they approach them with a
17:26 different uh with something different
17:30 what do you mean by approach them like
17:32 if I already go to the police and say
17:34 look like my husband is beating me up
17:38 like they kind of already know that yeah
17:41 so what can happen is that some people
17:45 yes like at that point it already is
17:47 quite a big problem we have already uh
17:51 R2 is also meant for cases that are not
17:56 like that but in that case even then
17:59 because a victim might still be in love
18:01 with their partner they might not
18:02 disclose everything that has happened in
18:05 the relationship so for example maybe
18:07 they come because of financial abuse or
18:11 maybe because of physical abuse but they
18:12 haven't disclosed that there has been
18:14 sexual abuse happening as well and this
18:17 is uh what we're trying to predict using
18:20 our tools because yeah even if they come
18:23 maybe they change their minds as well
18:25 right because it's a very high pressure
18:28 environment that they're in right then
18:30 being asked questions about the police
18:32 very personal questions as well and they
18:34 might tone down on the things that they
18:36 might disclose so then it's quite
18:39 important to have these risk assessments
18:41 not only to see uh what will happen in
18:44 the future but also what is likely
18:46 happening right now that a person might
18:49 not disclose in that
18:52 moment okay so in this scenario like if
18:56 I'm a police officer I would have
18:59 something like that and with yes very
19:01 serious face ask tough no not tough but
19:05 like this questions and maybe put some
19:07 pressure on the victim on the person
19:10 like I can imagine like a room maybe
19:12 without Windows like and then like if
19:16 you put in this environment and then
19:17 somebody with a piece of paper see his
19:20 face yeah like taking notes so this is
19:22 how it's done right now yes yes very
19:25 very much so yeah yeah and how are you
19:30 approaching
19:31 it right so first off we're taking
19:34 things off paper we already have an app
19:39 built to uh for right now for uh people
19:43 interacting with victims to also track
19:46 cases of domestic abuse which I think is
19:49 also another plus added because besides
19:52 having the paper tracking of what
19:54 happened you can also look over time uh
19:57 at what case
19:59 uh occurred like how many are high risk
20:01 how many are medium you can also look at
20:04 the person's history as
20:11 well yeah I mean um I think in terms of
20:16 interaction with the victim itself at
20:20 the moment given that the survey is
20:22 still administered by
20:25 uh a social worker or police officer
20:28 there's still trainings that we do with
20:31 the people so that they administer it in
20:34 the way that it's meant to
20:37 be uh we cannot eliminate that human
20:41 part or make it better but we can create
20:43 the interface to help release relieve
20:46 the load of the social workers and
20:50 police officers which are obviously
20:51 overworked as well which might come into
20:54 play when it comes to uh their
20:55 interactions with victim
20:59 and hopefully in the future it might uh
21:03 work on that as
21:04 well so it would be a police officer
21:08 sitting with a phone and talking to
21:11 victim and then taking maybe marking
21:14 questions right answers to the question
21:16 yeah yeah we have been thinking about uh
21:20 maybe an llm version of that given LMS
21:22 are so popular at the moment you know
21:24 like where you'd have a chat Bots uh
21:28 that interacts directly with the victim
21:30 and directly extracts the answer but
21:33 that is already like a very high
21:36 involvement and requires much more
21:38 funding um but we would be very keen on
21:42 doing that and make maybe making it
21:44 easier for victims to come
21:46 forward yeah and you mentioned that
21:49 currently what is happening is that
21:51 there are these paper surveys with
21:53 questions coming from the United States
21:56 from Canada from North America right and
21:58 and they are applied to Germans yes and
22:02 this is something you
22:05 also change right so do you do something
22:08 specific to geography to the country yes
22:12 yes yes so uh we already have uh done
22:16 two surveys looking at domestic abuse
22:19 first on a sample of
22:22 7,400 people so I would which is
22:25 nationally representative and we also
22:27 use weight meeting in order to ensure
22:30 that we have uh all of the demographics
22:34 our national representative as well uh
22:37 and then we did a second survey looking
22:39 only at uh people who have been victims
22:43 in the first one and seeing whether
22:45 they've re-experienced abuse uh after
22:48 three months and this again is another
22:51 Innovation that we're doing because what
22:53 happens at the moment is when people are
22:55 looking at uh reoccurrence of domestic
22:58 abuse they are looking at reoccurrence
23:00 after a year or more like some tools are
23:04 after seven years can imagine and
23:07 looking at fre months brings it in more
23:09 immediate attention and makes it uh
23:13 better for resource management as well
23:15 because you can know like you have to
23:17 act within three months not within a
23:22 year and AI here means that you do some
23:26 sort of machine learning or what exactly
23:27 exactly exactly yeah I mean obviously
23:31 for the audience like for a general
23:33 audience AI already means machine
23:35 learning but if you're a data audience
23:38 you know that AI is an if El
23:42 but because like now when I hear AI to
23:46 me it's like all this llm stuff right so
23:50 right you can actually feel like that
23:53 this thing is somehow intelligent right
23:55 when I talk to chpt like it feels like
23:58 I'm talking to a very smart
24:00 person right yes a very literate person
24:05 maybe yes literate yeah like cuz like
24:08 the expression it uses
24:10 are like much better than ones I use
24:14 honestly well I don't know it's better
24:16 but like it's different like I I don't
24:19 know if people speak like that but yeah
24:21 it's different I think it's fantastic
24:23 for writing text I I find it so useful
24:27 for writing text mhm so you use machine
24:30 learning and then you said you had the
24:32 survey with 740 people that you
24:35 interviewed
24:38 7,400 yes very
24:42 important more yeah yeah okay this is
24:45 serious and this is what you use for
24:47 your as your training data right yes yes
24:51 yes and U so the target variable here
24:55 was uh uh where the it was repeated like
25:00 the the abuse happened again in three
25:03 months right that's one of them yes
25:06 that's one of them they have multiple
25:08 and I guess the features uh are the
25:11 answers to
25:12 questions exactly yes I mean the
25:15 features and the targets are answers to
25:17 questions right so we're looking at uh
25:21 five different types of abuse so it's
25:23 digital emotional Financial physical and
25:27 sexual and the this again is another uh
25:30 plus that we have compared to what's
25:32 happening at the moment because perhaps
25:34 some intervention tactics might need uh
25:37 for you to look at uh the different
25:40 types of abuse and one example of that
25:42 would be a person experiences physical
25:44 abuse uh intense physical abuse and then
25:47 the immediate course of action would be
25:49 leave your partner however if you're
25:51 financially dependent on that partner
25:54 then that is very tricky to do um which
25:59 important to be able to dis distinguish
26:01 between these
26:02 categories
26:04 um sorry I'm trying to remember where
26:08 we're oh the targets yes sorry uh yes so
26:11 we have the the targets for from digital
26:13 to sexual abuse and we're using
26:15 questions from um questions do not Point
26:20 directly to that type of abuse so what
26:22 we call proxy questions in order to
26:25 figure out whether that abuse is
26:27 happening or not at the current moment
26:31 or whether it will happen in three
26:32 months so we have basically 10 targets
26:37 no yes 10 targets so five types of abuse
26:42 and identification and recidivism as we
26:44 call it
26:50 internally and I imagine like coming up
26:53 with this survey was the most difficult
26:55 part right or and then interview people
26:58 cuz like I imagine if I as a data
27:01 scientist try to come up with this
27:03 survey it will probably not be a very
27:06 good survey while like you have to have
27:08 proper social scientists right who know
27:11 how to ask questions yeah so I mean for
27:16 this I wasn't part of the data
27:18 collection because that happened before
27:19 I joined the company uh but basically we
27:24 took the literature for this because
27:26 there's already a huge body of lure
27:28 looking at surveys and uh creating these
27:32 risk assessments and we tried to use the
27:36 questions that were most re relevant in
27:38 those risk assessments and in addition
27:41 some questions that we wanted to test
27:43 out and to see whether they have any
27:46 correlation with
27:50 abuse and I imagine you also need to
27:53 work closely with police and social
27:55 workers
27:57 right so at the moment we're piloting
28:00 and we're working closely with police
28:02 and social workers and we also have a
28:04 lot of uh advisers on our team who work
28:08 in uh criminal law and uh domestic abuse
28:13 and also econometrics like you name it
28:16 if you look at our website I think we
28:17 have around 12 people that have advised
28:21 us along the way because our CEO like
28:23 he's
28:25 um the main domain expert exp ERT is
28:29 also a domain expert as well uh a social
28:33 scientist so she's been my uh first
28:38 point of contact when it came to
28:40 Technical and social science questions
28:43 but obviously like the CEO he has been
28:46 working like in the field for 15 years
28:49 and knows a lot of the
28:53 nitty-gritty that we should take into
28:55 account when we create these tools
28:57 because it can get very theor times and
29:00 I think with that as a data scientist
29:03 you can get very technical and very into
29:05 your world of developing a lot of models
29:09 and like looking at all of these
29:11 features but then in reality you don't
29:13 need as much
29:15 technicality
29:17 MH so the founders so it was CTO SEO
29:24 right uh well so we have
29:28 and Co uhuh so there were three
29:31 co-founders right they do they all come
29:34 from this
29:36 um how to say business domain like it
29:38 sounds that doesn't sound very good but
29:40 like do they all come from this um this
29:46 domain so yes the CEO definitely like
29:49 he's worked 15 years in the charity
29:51 sector uh Balin I think I mean she's
29:55 been working mostly on Frontline and
29:58 she's done research before intoxic
30:00 masculinity if I remember correctly that
30:03 was her master thesis and then Adam the
30:06 CTO um I think his background is more in
30:10 business he takes care of all of the
30:13 development aspect of
30:16 Lizzy Lizzy we didn't talk what Lizzy
30:19 means I have it in my
30:23 notes to right yes yes yes yes why it's
30:27 called isy
30:29 well I will assume you don't know how
30:32 the different risk assessments are
30:35 called they're just abbreviations odara
30:39 Dash da and we thought we might make
30:42 something a bit more humanizing in this
30:45 area especially as it's quite a
30:47 grueling uh experience to go through so
30:50 this is why we went for
30:53 Lizzy so Lizzy is just a name yes it's
30:57 it doesn't for
30:59 anything well no it's not an acronym
31:03 okay uh so coming back to like we were
31:06 discussing the co-founders and you said
31:09 that CEO is a domain expert and he's
31:12 been in this area for quite some time
31:15 like 15 years you said yes and was it
31:18 something that he noticed in his line of
31:20 work that this could be optimized that
31:23 right now was just a paper survey and
31:26 the pressure it puts on people people
31:28 it's not working and we can make it
31:30 better and he decided that there should
31:35 be a company right yes like there should
31:37 be a way to solve this problem
31:39 differently yes yes yes and I mean like
31:43 uh yeah so Babs like he's a he also has
31:48 a background some background in
31:49 statistics and Balin like being the data
31:52 scientist as well like you can see how
31:54 these two uh Fields can merge and come
31:58 up with this idea and especially in
32:00 Germany as you all know in Berlin you
32:03 have to carry cash everywhere
32:05 digitalizing is probably not that bad of
32:08 an idea it's something that Germany is a
32:11 bit behind on in some
32:15 sense it some sense yeah well right now
32:18 even p is like these late night shops
32:21 start accepting cards so yeah we're
32:24 slowly getting there it's moving in the
32:27 right direction but like I
32:30 remember in Poland 12 years ago it was
32:34 already possible to pay everyone with
32:37 just you know touching your card to
32:40 really 12 years ago with with the phone
32:42 are you serious no way
32:45 yeah and then like in Germany it
32:47 appeared only after Corona cuz like you
32:50 weren't supposed to touch the the this
32:54 part so only because of Corona in
32:56 Germany it was it was it started to be
32:59 possible to pil with you know just yeah
33:02 but it's still like I find it now I have
33:05 an reverse culture shock when I go to
33:08 different countries and I'm so surprised
33:10 they accept
33:11 card after living in Berlin yeah yeah
33:16 like I remember in France in a village
33:19 like I wanted to buy an ice cream and
33:21 there was a terminal so I could just pay
33:23 for this ice cream it was like a just
33:26 usual ice cream stand minimum 5€ 10
33:30 something like this yeah yeah anyways uh
33:34 so and this is just one of the areas
33:37 where digitalization is lagging behind
33:40 right but in other areas uh especially
33:42 like this is consumer facing so this is
33:44 is kind of this one is kind of moving
33:47 forward slowly but moving right but in
33:51 other
33:53 areas like social areas police like it's
33:58 probably behind right yes yes and there
34:01 is obviously lots of skepticism right
34:04 when bringing in AI to uh yeah to help
34:09 officers but that's the thing like I
34:11 think um there has been lot of uh news
34:16 criticizing the way that AI has been
34:19 used in order to make decisions and this
34:22 is why we don't use we haven't created
34:25 Lizzy to make decisions for police
34:28 officers but to help them it's a tool
34:30 for them to make a decision however it
34:33 has been shown in practice that risk
34:35 assessments are more effective than uh
34:38 an expert
34:40 judgment so this is why I think it's
34:42 quite important to have these tools but
34:44 not use them as the decision
34:48 makers which means that instead of just
34:51 saying the probability of abuse
34:55 occurring again is very high
34:58 you also explain why right or how what
35:01 does it mean in practice that you don't
35:04 use it to make decisions but to guide us
35:08 that we that we're looking at the risk
35:12 of uh the abuse occurring but the we are
35:16 not social workers we're not police
35:17 officers we're a research company so we
35:20 can tell you that's based on the
35:24 research that we've done this person is
35:27 likely experiencing abuse and you as an
35:31 expert you can say okay if they're
35:34 experiencing High uh Financial abuse and
35:37 high physical abuse this is what I
35:40 should do in this scenario we don't give
35:42 recommendation like we give suggestions
35:45 like okay this is something that may
35:48 help but we are not there to make
35:50 decisions okay and the users like the
35:54 police officers the social workers they
35:57 go through the survey then they see the
36:00 results I imagine immediately right they
36:02 don't need to send the results anywhere
36:04 and wait for a month to oh yeah
36:06 obviously
36:07 obviously and they don't need to
36:09 calculate it themselves they don't need
36:11 to put the points yeah so like they go
36:15 through this array they get the results
36:17 immediately and they see that like for
36:21 this types of abuse the probability that
36:24 this abuse is happening is high and then
36:26 there are some sest
36:28 of what they can do next right and then
36:31 it's up to them to decide what to do
36:34 like minimal suggestions because again
36:37 we're not the ones who are dealing with
36:39 the victim we're here to like say that
36:42 from our research we've seen that these
36:44 are good indicators of abuse and if
36:46 these are happening at this frequency
36:48 then then it's likely it's very very
36:51 likely that this person is experiencing
36:53 domestic abuse does it help to address
36:56 this uh the skeptic ISM you
36:59 mentioned what do you mean oh like you
37:01 said that it was met with skepticism
37:04 because people say like Ai No it's not
37:06 going to help yes obviously like we're
37:08 we're transparent about the metrics
37:10 we've use and we've been for many many
37:13 iterations in order to make this as good
37:15 as possible Right like we've been
37:17 looking at the typical standards in the
37:21 industry like the Au score we've looked
37:23 at false positives false negatives
37:26 obviously we've tried to to put the
37:28 weight on uh removing false negatives as
37:32 much as possible but at the same time if
37:34 we don't uh reduce if we say that
37:39 everything is high risk then that's not
37:41 very useful either so we've tried to
37:44 strike a balance as much as possible
37:45 thinking about the typical metrics that
37:48 are used and also thinking about the
37:51 types of questions that we selected in
37:53 our survey and what's more likely to be
37:55 answered by someone in those situations
37:58 ah so this is also important CU not like
38:01 maybe there are good questions that can
38:04 show you that this these sort of abuses
38:07 happening but the victim might not
38:11 answer them right yeah might be less
38:13 likely to answer however we yeah we're
38:17 hope the thing is like in different
38:20 settings you will have different answers
38:22 and this is also why like the survey
38:24 that we did was uh online rather than in
38:27 person because in person you already
38:29 have some biases occurring from like
38:32 when the interviewer asked the questions
38:34 to uh yeah receiving the
38:39 answer and these biases
38:41 are so here it means that because a
38:44 person is asking there could be some
38:46 pressure like even though the person
38:49 might be like the friendliest person on
38:51 Earth still because like somebody is
38:54 asking and then you might think okay
38:55 like there's another person like why why
38:57 are they asking that right it might not
39:00 give the I think humans are very
39:02 complicated and have complicated
39:04 emotions so it's very difficult to
39:06 predict that right so removing this
39:09 intermediate
39:11 Reep is likely to reduce such biases
39:14 there's also such a thing as social
39:16 desirability bias so for example
39:19 if uh you might not like if you're a man
39:23 and you disclose that you've been
39:25 experiencing abuse that might not
39:27 farewell right you might not want to be
39:29 seen as a weak man mhm I see and when
39:35 it's online there is less cuz like I
39:39 imagine if like that there is this like
39:41 big police officer cuz in Berlin like
39:44 the the infield police officers they
39:46 have to be quite strong MH and I see
39:48 that they are like usually tall like
39:51 they have muscles and if this person is
39:54 ask asking you like you maybe don't want
39:56 to admit that your week yeah but it's
40:00 just if it's just a screen and you take
40:04 boxes there it's less likely that
40:07 you give incorrect answers this is what
40:10 you're saying right yes this is this is
40:12 what I would expect right like you're
40:14 you're simply interacting online you
40:16 don't have your identity disclosed right
40:18 we're also taking care to not have the
40:21 identity of the people that uh we we
40:24 have surveyed so yes
40:27 we're hoping to reduce we to reduce that
40:30 bias that is already happening and this
40:33 is also important uh because a lot of
40:36 studies in domestic abuse sector are
40:39 also based on police data right and
40:42 police data will be inherently biased
40:45 because of the way it's been collected
40:47 right so this is where the biases come
40:51 and we hope to
40:53 eliminate uh at least those biases
40:55 through having this on
40:59 survey like how
41:01 do how do people get to fill the survey
41:04 is it something like they are in police
41:06 and then the police officer says okay
41:09 there is this tool I will leave now but
41:11 please while I'm away can you please go
41:14 through the website and answer questions
41:17 or how how does it no no no they I think
41:21 they ask the questions so uh yeah they
41:23 ask the questions and fill in the survey
41:26 or our admin
41:27 given a tablet where they can answer
41:30 these questions but yes we're piloting
41:33 and we're
41:34 Lear because if person is if a person is
41:37 asking then you have these biases right
41:40 like even even if they are sitting with
41:42 a tablet and then like I'm asking you
41:44 and then making some notes here it's
41:46 still me asking you yeah so actually I'm
41:50 not completely sure about this because
41:53 I've been kept very uh much in the
41:56 development side of things I would say
42:00 uh poten it could be either or but uh
42:04 yeah I think I will stick with the data
42:07 side well yeah maybe let's go into the
42:09 development side of things
42:11 then well I imagine that
42:15 um in order to like we talked about
42:18 skepticism right and in my experience to
42:23 reduce this level of
42:25 skepticism a person needs to understand
42:28 what is happening inside and usually you
42:31 want to use Simple models like usually
42:34 you can explain like linear regression
42:36 or logistic regression to like in late
42:39 terms to anyone if you're um if you have
42:43 enough patience uh typically this is the
42:47 case so I imagine for you you need
42:50 to use uh models like decision threes
42:53 maybe or linear models right or another
42:58 so actually logistic regression Works
43:00 quite well like
43:03 surprisingly uh yeah we've tried a
43:05 couple of model models we've tried uh
43:08 decision trees we've tried the boosting
43:10 algorithms we've tried support Vector
43:12 machines because it's like some
43:14 somewhere in the middle of the data set
43:16 but we found that actually logistic
43:19 regression has performed best like with
43:23 the features that we selected and the
43:26 number of features that we selected and
43:28 by best I mean both in terms of the
43:31 overall performance and in um having a
43:35 lower likelihood of overfitting because
43:38 this is what typically happens with
43:40 trees if you go to random forests and XG
43:43 boost and
43:46 whatnot actually there was now when you
43:49 talk about that I remember there was a
43:50 competition kagle also on survey data I
43:53 don't remember what was the target but
43:56 it was some social
43:57 Al social
43:59 sciences and their linear models worked
44:03 best too like the wi solutions they used
44:06 linear models yeah yeah so I'm actually
44:09 not surprised but also like as a side
44:11 effect or not maybe side effect but like
44:13 as a
44:14 benefit you can explain in simple
44:18 terms yeah why it works like why at the
44:21 end the result is high risk cuz you say
44:23 like this
44:25 answer has this sort of weight this
44:28 answer has this sort sort of weight CU
44:30 like this person said true to that
44:33 statement and false to that statement we
44:36 think that maybe this is a pencial abuse
44:41 right or maybe this is emotional abuse
44:44 and then because they understand now how
44:46 it works then they are more likely to
44:48 use the tool and trust it right yeah
44:52 yeah this is this is what we're hoping
44:54 and we're trying to get like the
44:58 uh some of the decision like we are yeah
45:03 it's much easier to explain for sure
45:06 because you just have like the
45:07 coefficients and you can get the odds
45:09 ratio from
45:12 that and what else do you do on the
45:15 development side of
45:18 things
45:20 everything when it comes to model
45:22 development like yeah it's funny because
45:25 I started the mlops uh course that you
45:27 do and I'm I'm still I'm still at the
45:30 first homework because I built the mlops
45:35 workflow let's say like with ML flow I
45:38 started with pie carat and then I left
45:41 it because it was too heavy like for the
45:45 the the app itself um yeah so I did like
45:49 the whole model development cycle
45:51 obviously like with a lot of input from
45:54 both Balin and Babs in terms of like
45:56 what outcomes we want like what
45:58 statistical tests maybe we should focus
46:00 on like when doing X and Y but in terms
46:03 of yeah model development it's kind of
46:05 been like yeah and and what uh my
46:10 previous colleague Joy did in the past
46:12 like in terms of recording data the
46:14 analysis he did and the initial
46:18 models
46:20 so you would say that your main focus is
46:23 on the modeling side like definitely
46:26 like my Main and only focus really yeah
46:30 yeah my colleagues were laughing that
46:31 I'm really bad at selling and that's
46:34 because I have a
46:36 practice right uh what is the most
46:40 challenging thing for
46:44 you I think
46:47 um yeah I think the very pragmatic
46:51 aspects of data
46:54 are is challenging and the sense
46:58 that I can build all of these models and
47:01 I can have all of these metrics and I
47:03 can run thousands of models I can put
47:05 them on AWS la la la all of those stuff
47:08 but then what does that that actually
47:10 mean like what what happens afterwards
47:13 if a person answers XY Z on a question
47:16 what happens right and being able to
47:19 test that and validate that I think is
47:22 uh the testing of the final models like
47:26 having the setting in mind is definitely
47:28 the hardest thing because I think also
47:30 like testing for ML models I feel it's
47:34 not as developed as unit testing or
47:37 integration testing as it is in software
47:40 development so I found it quite
47:42 difficult to like wrap my mind around
47:44 that and figure out a way to do it but
47:48 yeah I'm working on that and like making
47:50 we're working on scenarios in order to
47:54 um make that happen and make sure that
47:57 even like sure like our models work on
47:59 the bulk of the data but we also want to
48:01 make sure that for each individual we're
48:04 getting answers in the range that we
48:06 expect so this is another thing that we
48:09 do in addition to other tools because
48:13 we're really our main goal is to be
48:17 there and help every single victim of
48:19 domestic
48:21 abuse and yeah it was a bit packed so
48:25 I'm trying to like a bit lost so like
48:29 for sure I I took some notes so you said
48:31 like you want every individual to answer
48:35 in the range we
48:37 expect something like that no so we want
48:40 that that things make sense right like
48:44 if uh like the models they output a
48:49 probability right that's all they do
48:52 what that probability means is something
48:54 that we interpret is that high low
48:57 medium risk that's one thing second it's
49:02 uh regarding the severity of abuse right
49:05 because a machine learning model will
49:07 not make the difference between someone
49:09 controlling your finances and or
49:12 checking your um Facebook account or
49:15 hitting you so this these are all things
49:18 that we're we're taking into
49:21 consideration and we want to make sure
49:24 and I think this is uh kind of of a bit
49:27 of data validation you know like the
49:29 output of the model is within what we
49:31 would expect as humans to see as a high
49:34 or low probability but the probability
49:37 is outputed by a logistic regression
49:39 that's they're just they're just there
49:42 to optimize for victim or nonvictim
49:44 they're not giving more detail detail
49:47 than that so that's what we need to
49:49 do I think I'm starting to understand so
49:52 here the idea is that like a model just
49:55 gives a number
49:57 yes but we need to also remember that
50:00 well there is a human there yes to which
50:04 we kind of to who we calculate the
50:07 number but also like this number what
50:09 does it actually mean right yeah EXA how
50:13 high it is uh because like in the usual
50:16 logistic regression case like if it's
50:20 0.51 51 right then you predicted this is
50:25 like uh
50:30 y equals one right otherwise
50:33 yeah yeah and obviously as you know like
50:36 when you do model optimization you play
50:38 with the thresholds right you see what
50:41 gets you better results or not but that
50:44 doesn't really tell us like is this
50:46 person like a high risk does this person
50:48 need immediate intervention so this is
50:50 why we need all of this post modeling
50:54 testing okay in order to
50:57 yeah uh what you're saying is there
50:59 could be two people for one the risk is
51:02 zero point like 60% for other is 90 but
51:05 it doesn't necessarily mean that the 90%
51:08 case needs more urgent
51:11 help
51:13 right um no no I think like in terms of
51:18 relative scale that's definitely the
51:20 case but like at what point do you say
51:23 is it high risk I think that's more what
51:26 I'm with yes okay so one thing is
51:30 predictive predicting positive okay like
51:32 there is an instance of I don't know
51:35 digital abuse but also like to what
51:38 extent like after which cut off point we
51:41 need to actually intervene as soon as
51:43 possible
51:45 exactly I see and also what types of
51:48 abuse has the victim already um admitted
51:53 to so for example if a victim has been
51:55 choked at some point that's already
51:58 quite a a severe
52:01 thing so in that sense like that person
52:04 is already high risk even though it a
52:06 model might not see it like as uh fully
52:10 high risk but usually this this does
52:12 happen
52:14 fortunately but the thing is you don't
52:17 know until you test like all of these
52:20 different scenarios right like you
52:23 have what model metrics give you is oh
52:26 overall performance and I do trust that
52:29 because but it doesn't give you the
52:32 individual um results and those tend to
52:36 be more important and this is why we
52:38 want to focus on them so I think that's
52:41 quite a difficult thing I think it's
52:42 very underdeveloped like in uh machine
52:45 learning but it's something that we're
52:47 focusing
52:49 onh how many data scientists are working
52:53 on this it's me and Balin working
52:57 on it yes and a lot of advisors to help
53:00 us like shape it in the right
53:04 direction and then like you mentioned
53:06 mlops and all that but uh like I'm
53:09 wondering to what extent you need these
53:12 tools uh right now or more it's more
53:15 like right now it's more modeling heavy
53:17 because there are so many
53:19 unsolved problems or questions like I
53:23 mean like maybe now your focus is on
53:25 modeling side but once you have a very
53:27 good model then you focus more on
53:28 deploying this model this is what I mean
53:31 so we've already deployed the model and
53:33 we're piloting and we're working on uh
53:37 ensuring that the model is stable over
53:39 time but yeah the mlops part and like
53:43 setting up an experiment tracking has
53:46 been very
53:47 important for sure you use something
53:51 like ml4 for that right yes yes yes mhm
53:55 okay and uh the the survey that you
53:58 mentioned is it open the what the
54:02 results of the survey like there are
54:05 7,400 people who took part like are the
54:08 results open in any way or it's no not
54:11 at the moment okay like I'm I I'm just
54:15 wondering like if it's okay to ask you
54:19 about some things you found out in this
54:21 survey but maybe you can share but if it
54:23 was open then you probably can share
54:25 that
54:27 yes I'm happy
54:29 to yeah I'm happy to share what I've
54:31 shared already I think like with the
54:33 flow of the conversation like uh yeah
54:36 everything has been like within the
54:38 Realms of what I can share so more
54:40 specific statements I'm very happy to
54:43 yeah I'm just curious like
54:45 usually probably more women than men
54:48 have this problem but like are there men
54:52 who like because we talked about that uh
54:55 there is this bias
54:57 um social disability bias was it
55:00 desirability bias
55:02 yes how can you can you say it again Des
55:06 social desirability by desirability yeah
55:09 so maybe men even
55:11 like don't even think that they need to
55:15 seek
55:16 help I I would say that it's the case
55:20 for both women and men about seeking
55:22 help just because it's in intimate
55:24 partner violence that's like a very
55:26 difficult topic and I think one of the
55:29 misconceptions is that the person can
55:31 just leave the relationship which is
55:34 absolutely not true because they have
55:37 become partners with this person because
55:39 they love them so maybe they think the
55:42 person will change uh or that things
55:45 will be different so maybe they reach
55:47 out at some point but then they change
55:48 their minds and it's usually quite
55:51 difficult for people who are close to
55:53 them to intervene as well mhm
55:57 and percent wise like in this date uh do
56:00 you remember how
56:01 many men and women I I will tell you
56:05 that uh so men typically experience more
56:09 emotional abuse whereas women experience
56:12 more physical and sexual abuse and
56:15 overall women experience more abuse
56:18 overall uhuh I see yeah and for you as a
56:22 person like must be quite difficult to
56:24 work with this data like cuz like every
56:26 l in this data is a person is AA tragedy
56:30 right cuz like they have to live with
56:32 this
56:34 situation yeah I mean it's
56:38 um I think it's I would say it's a bit
56:41 similar
56:43 to well I don't want to compare myself
56:45 to a doctor but I think that as a medic
56:48 for example you get to dis sensitized at
56:51 some point based on the amount of uh
56:56 things you see and I won't say that I
56:58 got desensitized but I think sometimes
57:00 like I just look at data I don't look at
57:05 what actually has happened I look at
57:07 numbers because at the end of the day
57:09 these models are fed with data and I
57:11 think about okay how can I get these
57:14 metrics higher so when I do the model
57:17 development bit I don't really think
57:19 about it I just think about how awesome
57:21 it is that I get to help these people uh
57:25 and yeah but when I go into the analysis
57:29 bit and starting to think about like oh
57:31 what correlates with physical abuse and
57:33 you see like how abuse doesn't happen in
57:36 isolation and you're thinking about all
57:38 of these experiences of victims when I
57:40 go into the analysis bit that's when I
57:41 feel it the
57:44 most okay yeah thanks for sharing that
57:47 uh I think we should be wrapping up yeah
57:50 so usually one question that I ask most
57:52 guests is uh if there are any
57:56 recommended literature or material
57:58 around the topic um so maybe there is
58:02 something that you can recommend not
58:04 necessarily about domestic abuse uh but
58:06 maybe about social sciences or things
58:08 that helped you in your career um or
58:12 something like that like any book or
58:14 other resource that you can recommend to
58:16 the listeners many I think I have data
58:20 basis of resources so I think in terms
58:23 of domestic abuse actually two net nli
58:26 shows that approach this uh thing quite
58:30 well would be be reindeer most recently
58:33 and um made looking at domestic abuse
58:37 both well or abuse in general through
58:41 both uh the lens of man and a woman then
58:45 uh I think one of the recommended
58:48 readings uh I still have on my reading
58:51 list is look what you made me do in the
58:54 area of domestic abuse and then in the
58:57 area of other areas uh so many I think
59:01 the first thing that comes to mind is
59:03 the networking website called the
59:05 portfolio Collective which is quite
59:08 Niche it's usually for people having uh
59:12 multiple skills that they leverage
59:14 usually Freelancers doing all sorts of
59:17 different things maybe in the same field
59:19 maybe in different fields and they have
59:22 great social events and obviously data I
59:26 think is actually a great resource so I
59:29 would recommend that but I think it goes
59:32 without saying because it's free and you
59:36 can work and get a certificate at the
59:38 end so that's
59:40 wonderful and ion hack because I know
59:42 the teachers
59:45 so just Shameless
59:49 promotion yeah okay how did it feel to
59:53 be on that side of the podcast
59:57 good I think uh yeah it's interesting
1:00:00 and
1:00:01 uh it's interesting when you get lost in
1:00:04 the middle of the point and you're
1:00:05 trying to take it back in uh it's a
1:00:08 learning experience for sure for me it's
1:00:11 easier because like I keep notes I oh
1:00:14 wow there's are so structure look at
1:00:17 that do you have diagrams is that a
1:00:19 decision
1:00:21 tree no but
1:00:23 like some sort of diagrams yeah like I
1:00:27 was also uh drawing that like there's a
1:00:30 person who is asking a survey oh
1:00:32 right I was just trying to visualize
1:00:35 like how it actually help so for me it's
1:00:37 a bit easier because you do most of the
1:00:39 talking and I'm just asking questions
1:00:41 and then taking notes and then like
1:00:43 based on the notes I took I ask other
1:00:45 questions and if I run out of ideas I go
1:00:47 back to other notes and then okay I
1:00:49 wanted to ask about that okay so thanks
1:00:52 a lot for joining me today and thanks
1:00:55 everyone to for joining us today for
1:00:58 listening in and thanks for sharing
1:01:00 Saina um thank you for the
1:01:03 invitation yeah and with that we should
1:01:07 finish should be finishing so have a
1:01:10 great rest of your day and of the week
1:01:12 and see you soon likewise see you soon
1:01:15 bye take care
