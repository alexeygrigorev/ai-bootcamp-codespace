3:02 maybe just briefly mention things that
3:04 you worked on
3:07 uh like in your life and maybe let's
3:10 spend more time talking about what
3:12 happened uh in uh one year and a half
3:15 and I I forgot to mention one thing
3:17 sorry that the questions for today I
3:19 prepare are prepared by Johanna Byer
3:21 thanks Johanna for your help so now
3:23 let's start Dimmitri so tell us about
3:26 yourself. Sure. Uh um hi everyone. Um
3:30 basically I'm I started off in 2013. Uh
3:36 basically after I graduated in business
3:37 administration, I fell in love with uh
3:40 data after my first internship
3:43 basically. I loved Excel and so on so
3:45 forth. So that was basically my entry
3:48 drug into the world of data. And then uh
3:50 slowly after a few years um uh as a data
3:54 analyst working for different types of
3:56 companies um large corporations,
4:00 startups, a bit of everything. I uh kind
4:03 of did the next step did a master's in
4:06 data science basically to kind of level
4:08 up my skill set became a little bit more
4:12 technical and yeah so after I did all
4:15 that about six years of work experience
4:18 I found myself in a situation where I
4:21 reflected back on my career journey. I
4:24 saw that on average uh I mean until then
4:26 I worked for four companies on average I
4:29 were I worked uh one and a half years
4:31 with each employee uh employer and I
4:35 figured out that I'm not really good on
4:37 stick sticking around as an employee and
4:40 yeah so that was basically the my
4:41 decision to make a yeah make a change
4:45 and figure out something that I kind of
4:47 enjoy more doing and I thought that if I
4:50 could work on my own um that would be
4:52 the right solution. So yeah, I basically
4:54 in 2019 I basically bet on myself. I
4:58 quit my job and became a full-time
5:01 freelancer. I had no clients basically
5:04 ready. I had no transition plan,
5:06 anything like this. And I just thought,
5:08 let's give it a try. Um, let's try it
5:10 out for a year and if it works, great.
5:12 If not, I'll probably have learned that
5:15 I'm probably not as good on my own as I
5:18 thought and I would just go back.
5:20 Luckily, it worked out well. and about
5:23 six seven years in now as a freelancer.
5:25 I really enjoy it. Um really fits me uh
5:28 to my lifestyle and everything. So
5:30 that's why I also have the pleasure to
5:32 talk about the topic because I'm just
5:34 really in love with what I do. Mhm.
5:38 Yeah. I want like apologies I'm going a
5:41 bit off the script but isn't it fun?
5:44 Right. So you mentioned a few things uh
5:46 and I want to ask you about these
5:48 things. The first thing you said it's
5:50 that on average you stayed one year and
5:52 a half at each company when you were a
5:55 full-time employee. And I kind of had
5:58 the same situation uh for quite some
6:01 time until I found a company where I
6:04 managed to stay way longer.
6:07 And I'm wondering like isn't it becoming
6:09 a new norm to stay like uh I don't know
6:12 a year year and a half cuz like in one
6:15 year you can do a lot for a company
6:18 right
6:20 well it depends it depends I think I
6:21 mean some some probably uh people say
6:24 you probably need about six seven months
6:26 first of all to get started to do some
6:28 let's say damage or to really provide
6:30 value because at the beginning you have
6:32 to get to learn the people the product
6:34 um the tools and everything uh I mean
6:37 like this. So it takes time to really be
6:40 a let's say a valuable employee. But I
6:42 mean you can always I mean have
6:45 different opinions about that and then
6:47 and then yeah um I think that that takes
6:49 time but I have um I've thought a lot
6:52 about this and I've talked a lot about
6:54 uh this with friends and uh people and I
6:58 think first of all in tech it's probably
7:01 more common uh to switch jobs more
7:04 frequently and not stay on let's say
7:06 because it's also like to be frank sorry
7:08 for interrupting to be frank switching
7:10 jobs frequently is one of the best ways
7:13 of increasing your salary. Mhm. Yes,
7:16 probably. But uh when I did that, I
7:19 thought if I would switch a job again,
7:22 um maybe uh the company during the
7:24 interview process, they will ask me the
7:25 typical question given that you have
7:27 switched so often, how long do you think
7:29 you will stay with us? You know, and I
7:31 thought that's kind of it's a fair
7:33 question, but I also felt it was kind of
7:34 embarrassing to get asked that question.
7:36 So again that all moved along but I
7:39 think also it has to do maybe also
7:41 something to do with our generation
7:44 um you know older generations when you
7:46 hear how they talk about their employer
7:47 they maybe have worked for life or
7:49 decades you know for them and they have
7:51 given a gut or you know like their liver
7:54 you know to support them even in bad
7:56 times and everything and nowadays we
7:58 feel like if uh we don't get to work
8:00 from home if we don't get a certain I
8:02 don't know employee benefit you know
8:04 then the company uh you know they don't
8:06 value us you know and we make it so much
8:08 about ourselves and you know about the
8:10 employer so I think it's a mind mind uh
8:13 shift uh mindset shift and uh yeah it's
8:18 it's different nowadays but again you
8:20 can't change it if we are how we are
8:23 today in this generation if the work is
8:25 like how we are and if it again if it
8:28 permits that um big tech companies or
8:30 generally tech companies accept people
8:32 to switch that off I mean why not Mhm. M
8:36 but also like one of the things you
8:38 mentioned is um yeah it takes time to
8:41 become like a valuable employee in the
8:45 sense that you need to learn the ropes
8:47 you need to learn the people you need to
8:48 learn the tech some customuilt tech too
8:52 every company has that and you need like
8:55 at least 6 months for that but as a
8:57 freelancer doesn't it apply to you too
9:00 like that you need to like learn all the
9:01 ropes to do your job well Or the
9:06 assumption is that the employer the
9:08 somebody uh the the person or the team
9:11 who is hiring the freelancer kind of
9:13 prepares the the groundwork for the
9:16 freelancer to just come and for the
9:19 freelancer to just focus on their thing.
9:22 Um yes and no. I would say yes for there
9:26 are different types of freelancers and I
9:28 would say the two types that I would
9:30 generally say are the ones that sell
9:32 their skill and the other one that sells
9:35 their expertise. The one that sells
9:36 their skill for example is someone that
9:38 is good in Python you know is a data
9:40 analyst know I don't know PowerBI and so
9:44 on and so on. So you can really define
9:46 them by the types of skills they have.
9:48 And the company uh might say, "Hey, we
9:50 need someone with those skills. What we
9:52 going to need here is more supporting
9:54 role. So we're going to hire you for 6,
9:57 12, 18, 24 months or whatever." So it's
10:00 a long-term project and um yeah, you are
10:03 kind of as like treated as an employee,
10:06 but like on the pay role, you're not. So
10:09 in that sense I agree you have to come
10:11 on board you have to learn about all the
10:13 things because the project is not much
10:15 defined it's very open you know they
10:18 they know the skills you need so that's
10:21 the one thing if you are the other type
10:23 of freelancer that basically selling
10:25 their
10:26 expertise you work on a very specific
10:29 problem that you want to solve and you
10:30 have done it more like often more often
10:33 so you know exactly how what basically
10:34 the input variables look like of your
10:36 job what you need from a client you know
10:38 exactly what the client expects, you
10:39 know, so what the output or the product
10:41 at the end is and you basically optimize
10:43 for that. Um yeah, so I think it's a
10:46 little bit different um on the type of
10:48 service or product that you're trying to
10:50 sell as a freelancer.
10:53 But if you don't know how to solve the
10:55 problem like this specific problem but
10:58 you kind
10:59 of so my assumption but it works for me
11:02 as an employee employee that you can
11:05 fake it till you make it that you can
11:08 say okay I know how to solve this
11:09 problem and you start solving this
11:10 problem you start researching this
11:11 problem and eventually you solve it. It
11:14 also works with freelancing too, right?
11:17 Or maybe in this case, your expertise is
11:19 the problem solving skill.
11:22 I mean, now we're we're getting a little
11:25 bit like this, but I mean, you can
11:27 always the as you said there there are
11:29 always projects where you don't know
11:31 everything and there's a part where you
11:34 basically have to figure it out while
11:36 you go along and that applies to uh
11:39 employees or freelancers. It's basically
11:41 it's the task that needs to be um
11:44 delivered. Um so
11:47 yes, don't know how to further add on
11:50 this because again maybe we shouldn't go
11:52 there. But uh also lately I've been
11:55 doing some freelancing uh or maybe
11:57 should I call it contract projects but
11:59 anyway so I'm helping some companies
12:01 with doing courses. So I have been doing
12:03 courses for quite some time and now
12:07 companies thought this and say okay like
12:09 you're doing courses really cool like
12:11 your courses are really cool can you
12:13 come to us and also help us create some
12:16 courses. So I guess in this case the
12:18 expertise is uh I know how to create
12:20 courses but then I don't necessarily
12:23 know to like
12:25 100% the content that they need to
12:28 create. I know how to create courses in
12:30 general but maybe the specific
12:32 technologies that they want me to use I
12:33 don't know like and I have to you know
12:35 learn them and this is cool right I mean
12:38 yeah but I assume in that sense you know
12:41 how to create courses that's your
12:43 expertise how do you build a course you
12:46 probably have let's say I don't know if
12:48 you have a documented process or if you
12:50 have it just in your mind but I assume
12:52 that there's a in order to get a course
12:54 you probably first define who's the
12:55 course for um who's the audience Um what
12:59 are you trying to achieve? Where do you
13:00 like this transformation that you want
13:02 to give the audience through your uh
13:04 through the course? So where they're at
13:05 now, where where you want to bring them?
13:07 Um how do you do that? Um do you use a
13:11 specific technologies where the course
13:12 might be um hosted? Um what budget do
13:16 you have in terms of you know do you
13:18 just shoot it in like in your room? Do
13:20 you go into like a studio to record it?
13:22 So on and so forth. And that's probably
13:24 just like a nice framework. But that's
13:26 the expertise that you have and that's
13:27 basically the input and you just have to
13:29 fill the input you know with the
13:31 information that you get from the
13:32 client. So here you don't have to
13:35 compare it again to let's say uh a data
13:38 analyst that uh knows PowerBI and they
13:40 are part of a company and now they ask
13:42 them uh create this dashboard now help
13:45 us analyze this data now you know every
13:47 time the question is completely
13:48 different whereas you're selling the
13:50 expertise at the end is they want to
13:52 have a course and at the end of your
13:54 engagement they have a course that they
13:56 are selling to a client. Mhm. Yeah.
13:58 Right. Yeah. Makes sense. And uh you
14:01 said that freelancing worked out well
14:03 for you. So like how how did you know
14:06 that that it worked out well? You were
14:08 happier or like I mean the first thing I
14:12 think uh and what's the most important
14:14 part is if you make money. Um and when I
14:17 started out I again I had no client. I
14:19 had no idea. I the last the last uh
14:22 let's say employment engagement I worked
14:24 for a consulting company. So I already
14:27 got to see a little bit how consulting
14:28 works um what's the dynamic with the
14:31 clients and so on and so forth and I
14:33 always thought I could do it better you
14:34 know that's the typically I think the
14:35 motivator that you have that ego that
14:37 you think you can do it better and um
14:41 yeah so when I started out I gave myself
14:43 basically that deadline of 8 months um
14:47 to basically
14:48 get enough money or clients or something
14:51 like some signal that shows me hey I can
14:54 make money with this uh in the first
14:55 eight months and then if it doesn't work
14:57 I can have another four months to find a
14:59 job and with this I would basically more
15:01 or less complete 12 month where I
15:04 basically um had those savings for the
15:06 next 12 months to cover my living
15:07 expenses and everything like this. So
15:09 this was this was basically um um my uh
15:12 my goal or my strategy when I started
15:15 out. Luckily I one of my very first
15:18 let's say bigger projects was a
15:19 contracting project where I was hired as
15:21 a data analyst. Um so again that would
15:26 gave me the right feedback you know I
15:27 got directly let's say basically some
15:29 money and um and some good money
15:32 basically so I told in that moment you
15:34 think like oh I I made it you know I'm
15:36 successful I I got a client nice and I'm
15:39 actually making so much money but then
15:41 slowly you also figure out it's just one
15:43 client and I'm so dependent on them so
15:45 now how do you get other clients but
15:47 then I slowly also got other clients and
15:49 I was like oh look these are basically
15:52 the the um the signals that you want to
15:56 receive. But at the end, I think it's
15:58 making the money and that's the most
15:59 important part because if you don't make
16:01 it then you probably go to back to
16:03 another alternative and that's probably
16:05 employment and I think this we actually
16:08 talked about this already and um I was
16:10 asking you how exactly you got your
16:12 first client and um did you work with
16:16 recruiters back then like who helped you
16:18 find clients? So that is uh how easy was
16:21 it to find these recruiters?
16:24 Um find the recruiters
16:27 um let's say like this um the way I've
16:30 done it was um right before I became a
16:33 freelancer. I sometimes was getting some
16:37 um like on LinkedIn some um recruiters
16:40 asking me you know if I would be willing
16:42 to work as a freelancer because they
16:44 have some projects and that's basically
16:45 where I saw oh look there's like what I
16:48 do there are people that pay me with a
16:50 as a freelancer and that's basically how
16:52 I got in touch with the first recruiters
16:55 and then I basically saw the basically
16:57 the keywords like uh uh how they
17:00 advertise themselves or they post
17:03 projects on LinkedIn and and under
17:05 specific like let's say contracting, you
17:07 know, that's one of the key terms, you
17:09 know, that's always been used. So then I
17:12 was doing some research and I found some
17:14 more and some more uh um recruiting
17:16 agencies basically and I reached out to
17:19 them, sent them my CV, asked them to um
17:22 get on calls, you know, so I can also
17:24 ask them questions and yeah, learn more
17:26 about the situation. Mhm. Yeah. And um
17:32 so you've been in the industry for quite
17:35 some time and also I was observing the
17:38 trends and the industry changing. Um so
17:41 a few years ago very popular I think was
17:44 Malops. Now I don't see many like it's
17:48 not let's say a hot term anymore
17:52 that the problem is still there. People
17:54 still need to solve these problems that
17:56 Malops was solving. uh but because we
17:59 have AI, we have new hype, new terms
18:01 like other things are more in demand,
18:03 more popular popular in your opinion
18:05 from your point of view, what are the
18:07 things that
18:08 um are hot on the market right now where
18:12 if if I want to start freelancing, I'll
18:16 have better chance to find clients in
18:17 these areas.
18:20 It's tough on with a hot because again
18:23 my job is to let's say feed my own
18:25 pipeline and I'm not let's say the the
18:28 market research guru that should we even
18:31 care about this uh should we chase the
18:34 terms like should we chase the hot
18:35 topics or maybe there are some topics
18:37 that are good enough they have been good
18:40 enough and they're going to continue
18:41 being good enough and that's enough and
18:44 I'm coming to that is um because I don't
18:47 know the hot topics because hot topics
18:48 probably always there's this component
18:51 of again they are hot that's why they're
18:52 in the news let's talk about let's say
18:54 the last few years with generative AI um
18:58 just because it's a hot topic do also
19:00 now companies look for freelancers with
19:02 those skills um yes no might be I'm not
19:04 that freelancer so I'm not looking into
19:06 this uh always but what I've seen and I
19:09 found it funny because you just
19:10 mentioned MLOps I felt um because I I do
19:13 have a let's say a job board for
19:16 freelancers and I have created some
19:18 statistics around that and I always look
19:20 into that and what I find funny is that
19:23 I generally see let's say lots of
19:26 freelance projects for the title of data
19:29 analyst or data engineer but I see fewer
19:33 and fewer for the for example the data
19:35 scientist and I thought like is a data
19:37 scientist disappearing
19:39 um or did the data scientist over time
19:42 uh for example um rebranded itself to ML
19:47 engineer here. Um, and then again, now
19:50 it's something else. Now it becomes an
19:51 AI engineer. Uh, I have I haven't I
19:54 haven't spotted that one yet, but I can
19:56 still see that let's say the basic um uh
20:01 data analyst or data engineer titles,
20:03 they are they are going pretty strong.
20:04 And that's probably what most people
20:06 also that are not that are hiring those
20:09 roles and they're not always uh that
20:11 technical. they kind of understand that
20:13 the data analyst is the person that
20:15 basically visualize the data gets the
20:16 insights out of it and the data engineer
20:18 is the one that basically does all the
20:20 um infra infrastructure behind that
20:22 might that much be more behind that you
20:24 could have a data architect and so on so
20:26 forth but they don't know that so that's
20:27 why I think those umbrella terms of data
20:30 engineer datalist are still going very
20:32 strong
20:34 you see do you see ML engineers right
20:37 now
20:39 um I see it sometimes but again I I I I
20:43 haven't um looked into it that closely
20:46 to be honest. So So what is this job
20:50 board? Is it something that you're
20:51 doing? You're maintaining. Yes. Um
20:54 basically well a few years just to give
20:57 context a few years ago like two years
20:59 ago after while I was on paternity leave
21:02 I was sharing more my journey as a data
21:03 freelancer like as I'm doing it right
21:05 now. And
21:07 um so I basically um started learning
21:11 how other freelancers find their jobs
21:12 and so on so forth. And one part was
21:15 that um again how do we get clients and
21:19 the most visible let's say projects out
21:22 there are being posted by recruiting
21:24 agencies that all have their um
21:27 individual job board basically on their
21:29 websites. Um there are people that post
21:31 it for example on LinkedIn. there are um
21:34 some projects that say on Upwork and so
21:35 on so forth. So I build basically um I
21:38 basically crawl all these websites and I
21:40 basically aggregate it all into one um
21:43 freelancer or data freelancer dashboard
21:45 um sorry job board and um that helps
21:48 basically to always stay on top to see
21:51 what's the basically the newest um
21:53 project out there and then of course
21:55 crawling those information you get
21:56 information um on average how much uh
22:00 some of the projects what is the budget
22:02 for them uh so you can start doing some
22:05 interesting statistics around that. Um
22:08 and I also follow there are some big
22:10 let's say um organizations that also
22:14 help freelancers get uh a project with
22:17 um with clients you know like freelancer
22:19 map that is basically the know the like
22:21 this umbrella company where all those
22:24 agencies can also basically post their
22:27 projects and they also publish uh some
22:29 market research studies that I also
22:32 particularly enjoy and it's nice
22:33 sometimes to see similar trends that
22:35 they talk about um on freelancers that I
22:38 kind of sometimes also see in in my job
22:41 board, you know. So, it's becoming
22:44 bigger. Yeah. Yeah. Your job board is
22:47 specifically about data freelancers,
22:48 right? So, you don't do dev ops, front
22:50 end, back end. Correct. I mean, I I
22:53 segment a little bit on on the um on the
22:56 job title. Um so sometimes I have to
22:59 update it a little bit because I crawl
23:01 much more, but I try to kind of put it
23:03 down, let's say, more filtered way in
23:05 the job board. Sometimes I I also let's
23:08 say have some bad filters on place. So
23:10 sometimes if there's an AI company
23:12 looking for designer gosh I got a
23:14 designer in my in my in my job board but
23:16 that's rare uh rarely happen but yeah um
23:20 sometimes I have to update it if you
23:21 know LLM's LLM engineer becomes like a
23:24 cool thing now I have to add it
23:25 basically so it appears there otherwise
23:27 I get tons of also let's say more
23:30 software engineers that have less to do
23:32 with data. So tried to really try to
23:34 really uh um pin it down to um data
23:38 freelancers and I focus on and I try to
23:40 segment it by data analyst, data
23:42 engineer, data architect, AI specialist,
23:45 um web analyst and so on so forth.
23:49 Do you think it would it could be more
23:51 valuable to start freelancing as
23:54 a more like um generic software engineer
23:59 not focusing on data and then transition
24:01 to data or maybe when it comes to
24:03 freelancing cuz in freelancing you sort
24:06 of specialize you sell your expertise
24:09 right so is it a valuable approach or
24:11 maybe it's better to actually you know
24:14 learn data engineering properly first
24:16 and
24:17 and start freelancing.
24:21 It's hard to basically say what's the
24:22 best route. Um I would always look at
24:25 what does the market have and go kind of
24:27 backwards from there. Yeah, this is
24:29 where the question actually how it came
24:31 to my mind because we were talking about
24:34 um you parsing these scrolling these
24:36 different websites and then uh throwing
24:39 away things that are not related and my
24:42 assumption was that there are quite a
24:44 few
24:45 uh backend engineers or general software
24:48 engineering positions that you throw
24:51 away because they are not data related.
24:53 Mhm. And I was thinking if there are so
24:54 many maybe it actually makes sense. It
24:57 might make sense for somebody who is
24:58 looking to start their freelancing
25:00 journey to start
25:03 there or no what do you think but we can
25:08 all I mean it also depends on the skills
25:10 one one have you know like if if I'm a
25:12 data analyst I I probably won't just
25:14 become a software engineer from
25:16 tomorrow. I mean it takes time to learn
25:17 those skills you know. Mhm. I mean but
25:19 do you have the
25:21 numbers? Um I could pull up numbers but
25:25 again not as so fast. I mean again on
25:28 the um you see a little bit if if you
25:31 would go to the website there's now the
25:33 freelancer rates section and which has a
25:35 little bit of uh let's say some
25:37 distribution of how much different the
25:39 data freelancer right the data the data
25:42 freelancer.com and then when when you're
25:44 on the website on in the header you see
25:46 freelancer rates and that's where you
25:49 see your face
25:53 there freelancer rates cool yes and and
25:57 Now I basically do like a distribution
25:59 of basically the hourly rate of those
26:02 projects and the skills basically that
26:05 are basically the top performing skills
26:07 or the most frequently occurring skills
26:09 per job title. Um and also the ones that
26:13 basically pay the most but those are the
26:15 ones probably they have the least count
26:17 um but not in order now to confuse uh
26:20 some people who can see that it's
26:22 basically um that's the more or less the
26:24 data that I have. So yes, I could
26:26 technically um go and see how many
26:30 software engineering roles am I throwing
26:31 away and so so on so forth. But um but
26:35 yeah, again it's it's part side project.
26:38 Um it's part uh it serves my own purpose
26:42 because again the the the job board I've
26:45 built it for me you know for myself but
26:47 again I I can also first of all I cannot
26:50 99
26:52 uh% or even more you know are projects
26:54 that I cannot work on my own or not
26:56 applying on it because I'm busy myself
26:59 but once in a while I I do open it and I
27:01 do apply for projects that I haven't
27:04 there because again why should I go to
27:06 all those different recruiting agency
27:08 websites or um why should I go to um
27:12 other uh job boards or tools that I know
27:14 that exist? It's just a waste of time if
27:16 I now built a crawler and adding a new
27:19 source for me is is now a fraction of a
27:21 second because I built my little system
27:23 and again I came from a Excel I mean I
27:26 came from a business uh I first studied
27:29 business then I went to Excel then
27:30 slowly learned Python. So again, while I
27:33 do know a little bit how to code, I'm
27:35 still a terrible coder. And if I can
27:37 build a tool like this, like a crawler
27:39 and everything, it teach me a little bit
27:40 about data engineering myself. And um so
27:43 again, it's it's also a learning pro uh
27:45 pro project basically for me. Then I'm
27:48 looking at the rates and then you have a
27:50 section with top paying skills. And by
27:52 the way, the website looks pretty neat.
27:54 Uh it's it's very cool. Um so the the
27:58 first co-pay skill is data management
28:00 and the second is AI development. So for
28:03 data management the average rate is
28:06 $120 and AI development is
28:11 $116. So what is data management like
28:14 data man? Yeah that that's a good one. I
28:16 have to I have to better define them out
28:18 on the website. So usually data
28:19 management are the ones that have
28:21 basically in the title something with
28:22 data and something with management.
28:25 Uh is it like I guess organizing the
28:29 data stoages right like should you use
28:32 S3 should you use my SQL should you use
28:34 I don't know um Hadoop whatever it could
28:38 be it could be pro it's a little bit of
28:40 again I have to be better in those
28:42 filtering um uh that for sure but still
28:46 usually the way it works is when I see a
28:48 project I have like this very simple
28:50 let's say case when statement and you
28:52 can imagine like the first ones I always
28:53 like if let's say data analyst is in
28:55 there then it's a data analyst if it's
28:57 data engineer it's a data engineer and
28:58 so on so forth and then so one of the
29:00 very last ones is if I if I'm not able
29:02 to categorize it because there's
29:04 something else in there then I always
29:05 check if there's something with manager
29:07 or lead uh in there so those projects
29:09 could be either let's say um a database
29:12 manager for example which might be much
29:15 more technical but it could also be uh
29:17 for example uh data strategy project you
29:20 know where you might need a little bit
29:22 more business data skills uh than being
29:25 a technical person. Those goes also into
29:27 the data manager because you're kind of
29:29 a team or sometimes they look for a
29:32 fractional uh data lead. Uh so now
29:35 you're more a team lead position and
29:37 that's why it's more manager. Yeah. Now
29:40 it makes total sense why it's the top
29:41 paying skill, right? So if you throw in
29:43 the management uh scenario here when you
29:48 team the top the top paying skills
29:51 usually are the ones that have the
29:52 almost the least count. So again they
29:55 might appeared maybe once or twice but
29:57 in a project that paid a lot. So now
29:59 it's paying up. I still have to put some
30:02 weights uh basically to that to show
30:04 that one. But again I just launched it
30:06 and again it's but it's it's I thought
30:08 why do you always have to wait to show
30:10 the perfect data? Um sometimes I can and
30:14 and data people sometimes I think they
30:16 can see that they can smell the they
30:18 they see the job board they can smell it
30:19 and if you have a little bit of
30:21 experience and that's again someone who
30:23 goes into freelancing shouldn't be the
30:24 student from day one it should be
30:26 someone that has a little bit of
30:27 experience and they can I think they can
30:29 see the job board and or even the
30:31 statistics right now they can see hey
30:33 there's some truth to it um it might not
30:34 be the perfect visualization but the
30:36 beauty is that those people usually
30:38 reach out to me and tell me like hey why
30:39 don't you add this to the um uh to the
30:42 freelancer um visualizations and and
30:45 then slowly if I get the time I'll I'll
30:47 add them uh because my goal is to again
30:49 make it available to anyone.
30:53 Okay. And then right now I'm checking
30:55 the other section of your website which
30:57 which is the job board. Mhm. That's
31:00 pretty cool. Thank you. H do you plan to
31:03 publish any of the historical data in
31:05 open source so people can do like
31:07 analysis trends and then see what was
31:09 trendy what is now trendy
31:12 um I haven't thought about this because
31:13 no one has asked me so far um maybe
31:17 maybe I should maybe yeah cuz like maybe
31:19 you can just put it on cargo data sets
31:22 and then because like some of the
31:24 questions that I asked you what is treny
31:26 what is not trendy it's difficult to
31:28 answer without data right but when you
31:30 have the data and you actually do then
31:32 it's just a matter of somebody taking
31:35 time and digging into the data and then
31:37 finding the answers and perhaps um cuz
31:39 we do courses and uh for these courses
31:42 there are projects and people the course
31:44 participants are always looking for
31:46 interesting data sets to d to dig into.
31:49 So this could be a nice I like that
31:52 idea. It's no it sounds nice especially
31:55 um let's say especially freelance jobs
31:58 postings overall they don't have a long
32:00 lifetime val value so the data gets
32:03 let's say uh irrelevant really fast
32:05 because someone is looking at some at
32:07 the freelancer right now they look for
32:09 probably one two weeks and that's
32:11 probably when they found someone and
32:12 then basically that job posting is
32:14 basically now irrelevant for new ones
32:17 that's why also the job board only shows
32:20 um projects that are I think up to one
32:22 month old. Uh but again, usually I cut
32:25 off. I started doing it in
32:29 uh I think around March last year. So
32:31 now starting to get like a full year of
32:33 data um and slowly. So yeah. Um Okay. So
32:38 yeah, it's a nice idea. I uh I'll think
32:41 about this and then maybe uh get back to
32:43 you offline, you know, on how should I
32:45 structure it or put it up there, you
32:47 know.
32:48 I would be super happy to help because I
32:52 we have published a few data sets on
32:53 Kaggle and we ask the community to do
32:58 things with this. So anyways, the topic
33:01 is not publishing data sets. The topic
33:02 is freelancing. We talked a lot about uh
33:05 starting getting started with
33:07 freelancing. I don't think we should go
33:09 and repeat uh these things again. But um
33:13 okay, let's imagine I found a few
33:15 clients um and it's been a couple of
33:18 months since I started freelancing. So I
33:20 kind of have clients
33:22 uh and I know what to do to find a new
33:25 one. What's next? like should I just
33:27 continue doing this and just be a
33:30 freelancer or there is something else
33:32 like can I start a business of
33:35 freelancing or maybe it's a just good
33:38 thing to just continue doing what I do
33:40 cuz um I think you mentioned that it
33:43 allows you to live the lifestyle you
33:45 want and this is already a cool thing so
33:47 why not why why ruin it right if it's so
33:50 cool I think it depends first of all
33:53 everyone has is built differently um
33:55 everyone has different aspirations and
33:58 uh again um I think first of all if
34:00 someone starts out freelancing and they
34:02 have had their first initial success
34:04 with the first clients and they see it's
34:06 working and it's working for them as a
34:08 let's say as a source of supporting
34:10 their um uh their lifestyle their life
34:14 and everything because that's why I
34:15 think for me it's I call it a lifestyle
34:17 business
34:19 um if you get to that stage you have
34:21 that confidence that you don't worry oh
34:24 will I get the next client and so on so
34:25 forth for so that's probably the moment
34:27 where you ask yourself should I grow as
34:30 a business um and that's something that
34:33 I've done myself uh in my second year
34:36 because I thought the first year went so
34:37 well uh now the next natural step is to
34:39 become let's say an agency where I'm
34:42 pretty good on sales I get more clients
34:44 and now I outsource to other freelancers
34:46 who do the job for me and some people
34:50 are pretty good at that and they enjoy
34:51 that um for me it was a lesson that I
34:55 learned that I'm not that type of
34:56 person. I've uh basically um had two
35:00 very let's say I would say larger
35:03 projects with two clients uh where on
35:05 the one side I uh the first project I uh
35:08 hired or subcontracted four freelancers
35:10 and the second project I had uh nine
35:12 freelancers. So that's already a big
35:15 number or bigger team to um to manage.
35:19 And for me those two experiences were
35:22 crazy pain points uh to manage people,
35:25 follow up, check if everything was fine
35:27 and deliver something to to the client
35:30 and kind of help them to keep things
35:33 alive, you know, the maintenance part of
35:35 it. And yeah, so I figured out for
35:37 myself that uh I'm not the the agents
35:40 type of person. Um and therefore I
35:43 personally discarded this that idea or
35:45 that path for me. But uh some people are
35:49 good at it and make it work and it I
35:51 mean there are data agencies out there.
35:53 Um so it's it's possible just uh not for
35:57 me. Um and then what other path are are
36:00 there? Again
36:02 um for me uh I came to the realization
36:05 that I want to be basically the the one
36:08 person uh um a one person team. Uh I
36:12 don't mind sometimes collaborating uh if
36:14 there's a um if there if there's a right
36:18 opportunity, but
36:19 usually I I I work with clients as a
36:22 freelancer to be honest. You don't need
36:24 100 clients. You don't need to have to
36:26 chase clients. Once you get your fair
36:28 share, a handful of good clients, um
36:31 basically they can support you for a
36:33 long time, for a good time. Um again,
36:36 getting new clients is is a hassle. It's
36:39 a challenge. Doesn't matter if you just
36:40 started out or if you're there after 10
36:42 years or probably 20 years. New clients
36:44 is always a new challenge. Um but
36:46 usually uh from my experience is
36:51 um if you have clients, they help you to
36:53 get new clients because they refer you
36:55 and again you don't want to chase always
36:58 new clients. You want to chase the
36:59 projects and usually the projects are
37:01 within your existing clients. So you
37:02 basically want to milk the cow as as
37:05 much as you can basically. And um yeah,
37:08 so that's that's usually the the
37:11 journey. And with all the let's say AI
37:14 tools out there nowadays, um I feel like
37:17 uh a one person business can become so
37:19 much more effective. again um Claude
37:22 call codes a lot of I don't know SQL
37:25 statements for me if I have to do
37:26 something really fast and instead of me
37:28 figuring it out I I just ask Claude to
37:31 come up with a query and usually with
37:34 just triggering a little bit I I get the
37:36 one that I needed instead of spending
37:37 maybe 10 15 minutes I spend two minutes
37:39 you know and that's a huge uh timesaver
37:42 uh same for coding but also same for
37:45 coming up with ideas or approaching a
37:47 problem having this AI sparring partner
37:51 on your side, you know, is uh is super
37:53 helpful and especially if you're a one
37:55 person business, it's uh it's something
37:56 that uh we didn't have 5 years ago.
38:00 Definitely. Yeah. I also noticed that my
38:02 product productivity skyrocketed once I
38:05 incorporated this AI tools in my
38:08 workflow. So I don't need to write a lot
38:11 of SQL but like code. Yes. Do you use
38:13 any other tools um except cloud?
38:17 um so far clawed because that like when
38:21 I started using it few months ago or a
38:24 couple months ago already now um they
38:26 were kind of the best ones that I found
38:28 for 3.1 model is amazing for coding is
38:32 pretty pretty good. Um now of course the
38:35 chat GPT AI model with a pretty funny
38:38 images you know came out. So of course
38:40 uh I uh I always buy CHP and then I
38:45 cancel it again after a month and then
38:47 after a few months I again I use it
38:49 again. Um it's more of yeah creating
38:52 some images or just playing around
38:54 basically and I I use it for example
38:57 also for the data freelancer um um
39:00 because I also crawl projects that are
39:02 basically uh in German or in French or
39:05 in other languages and uh what I do is I
39:09 um I ask it to basically translate that
39:11 or for example um read the job
39:13 description and give me the ski the text
39:15 skills out of it in like comma separated
39:17 lists and to do things like this. Uh I
39:21 think uh for example, it's pretty good
39:23 and again chpg was there from day one.
39:25 So it's also the one I'm most familiar
39:27 with when I use it as an API. Do you
39:30 don't use cors or lovable or things like
39:33 that? Uh no, not yet. Uh again there are
39:36 so many sometimes I think like should I
39:38 spend more time to figure it out but
39:39 again than cuz uh I
39:42 recently yeah I I recently cancelled my
39:46 clot subscription and so I was paying
39:49 like was it 20 bucks I think and then I
39:51 started I put this 20 bucks per month to
39:54 Corsor cuz I think like I was using it
39:57 for coding mostly and now I have the the
40:00 chat inside my Visual Studio. Oh, it's
40:03 Corsor, but it's like Visual Studio Code
40:05 4. So then I don't need to switch
40:07 between the browser and the uh my
40:09 environment. So I can just chat
40:11 immediately there. That makes sense.
40:13 Especially if you if you're coding a
40:15 lot. Yeah. Well, I wish I code uh more I
40:18 coded more than right now cuz like I do
40:21 a lot of operational stuff. But uh and
40:24 um other thing is you mentioned that um
40:28 for you it's a lifestyle business. What
40:31 exactly do you mean by a lifestyle
40:32 business?
40:35 Um what I mean again lifestyles for me
40:38 is how you live your life and uh if I
40:42 don't have to um answer to nobody um
40:45 just by just basically to myself on uh
40:49 where do I want to work when do I want
40:51 to work
40:52 um do I want to work on my couch or in
40:54 my bed I mean nowadays it's different
40:57 it's slightly different because some
40:58 people say that after the covid uh
41:00 pandemic uh so many uh jobs are now
41:03 working from home and or working from
41:06 your home office is so much more
41:07 acceptable. But again, just because
41:09 you're a freelancer, it's not just you
41:11 can work from home. Um uh also I
41:15 switched companies in the past because I
41:17 switched uh country and sometimes I
41:19 proposed the my employers um to keep
41:22 working for them just from a different
41:23 country and that often they always say
41:26 like oh no that's kind of a legal issue
41:28 or whatever. Now again, if I switched uh
41:32 uh country, there's no problem. I just
41:34 do it and I stay uh I keep being a
41:36 freelancer. I keep working with the same
41:38 clients. There's not this issue.
41:40 Um so that's something um that I think
41:44 plus I feel like as an employee um let's
41:48 say employee versus a lifestyle business
41:50 um again you have specific task you have
41:53 to work on that
41:55 um once you are a freelancer and like
41:58 there's this let's say entrepreneurial
42:00 aspect to it because you are your own
42:02 business you start working on things
42:05 that don't always let's say move the
42:07 needle but you start experimenting you
42:09 create this new mental map in your head
42:12 of what is possible basically to let's
42:14 say make money or to fulfill any other
42:17 pleasures and that could be a good
42:19 example for example of the data
42:21 freelancer where I said oh um let me
42:24 build a a job uh like the job board let
42:26 me also now slowly start to build
42:29 because at the end the the data
42:30 freelancer is basically my online course
42:33 uh for data professionals who want to or
42:35 who are interested in uh becoming a
42:37 freelancer
42:39 and um basically building it up. I
42:42 thought I mean I could put it on uh
42:45 Gumroad or any other uh online platform
42:47 to sell these things but I thought hey
42:49 why not building it myself. Um so
42:52 there's this one aspect where I said I
42:54 want to code it myself especially in
42:56 JavaScript which I haven't done before
42:57 so I had to learn it partially also
42:59 using AI tools helped me a lot to code
43:01 as well. Um but again I see also people
43:05 again paying for the course and every
43:07 time uh someone pays and I get the small
43:09 stripe notification. It's like this
43:11 little thing of pleasure. Again it's not
43:14 uh you don't become rich you know or at
43:16 least I don't become rich through that
43:18 but uh it's like this little thing where
43:20 you think like oh I just woke up
43:22 and someone uh I just made some money
43:24 you know. Um and it's different from the
43:27 let's say freelancer mindset of working
43:29 uh um for an hourly rate. I mean not all
43:33 projects have to be hourly rate but it's
43:34 that mentality where most freelancers
43:37 start from working with an hourly rate
43:38 and now you you make money while you
43:41 sleep and you think oh now I basically
43:44 I'm not a data analyst in in this case
43:46 I'm more a course builder and a
43:49 marketeteer. So now you figure out new
43:52 skills and passions that you have and uh
43:55 yeah so now I see that uh I learned
43:57 about uh scraping. So now I have um a
44:01 specific let's say product that I sell
44:03 to some of my clients where I use the
44:05 code that I already pre-built for the
44:06 scraping and I tell them hey if you want
44:08 to scrape I don't know your competitors
44:10 or something else let's do that you know
44:12 because now I learned about scraping and
44:14 so I start integrating little things and
44:16 I um upsell my clients and again at the
44:18 end it's this entrepreneurial mindset or
44:21 a map that I have in my mind and uh and
44:25 now I say maybe I should do something
44:27 like a drop shipping business. I know
44:29 like some other things but whatever
44:31 let's say idea you have as a freelancer
44:35 you have the time just do it try it out
44:36 if it doesn't work well didn't work but
44:38 uh it's this it's this uh yeah it's this
44:41 freedom of trying out things and I think
44:42 that's part of the lifestyle business
44:44 that I uh that I enjoy. Yeah, makes
44:47 sense because you're at 10, you're your
44:49 own boss and you decide, okay, like this
44:51 day I will invest in trying something
44:54 new and these two other days I'll invest
44:56 in working with existing projects,
44:58 existing clients and maybe this one
45:00 extra day I'll invest into looking for
45:02 new projects whatever whatever it is
45:04 right but then you have the freedom you
45:06 may realize that this day I spent will
45:09 not necessarily bring me money
45:11 immediately but at least I have the
45:12 freedom of saying this is day for me I
45:15 want to explore new things I to build a
45:16 course or maybe I want to see what's
45:18 possible there. I'm make I'm not making
45:21 money right now but it's okay and nobody
45:23 can tell you that you cannot do this
45:25 right because it's on time.
45:28 Yeah. And you mentioned you have a
45:30 course. What this course is about? Um
45:32 again it's data freelancer. It's um a
45:35 online course for data professionals who
45:39 are have been employees basically and
45:41 now they are considering about going
45:44 freelancing or they want to discover
45:45 this world of freelancing because for
45:47 many people they don't know how to
45:49 become a freelancer. Uh what what are
45:52 the considerations they should do before
45:53 actually doing the move? Um what how do
45:56 you actually get clients as a
45:58 freelancer? What are the steps? Um what
45:59 are let's say little strategies that you
46:01 can use? So it's not just for um data u
46:05 professionals who want to become
46:06 freelancers but also maybe those who
46:08 just started out and they just want to
46:09 see hey how are others doing it and it's
46:12 basically it's an online course that
46:14 gives a foundation online course plus uh
46:16 basically a PDF where I put on all my
46:18 knowledge
46:19 and apart from that we are a small
46:22 community of uh like-minded freelancers
46:25 uh and who want to be freelancers uh and
46:28 basically we get together we have we
46:30 answer each other's questions questions
46:31 on how do you do I don't know how do you
46:34 apply for these types of clients um how
46:36 do you do with uh I don't know your
46:38 taxes uh whatever question it is so
46:40 we're trying to support each other and
46:43 uh on the side I also organize um I try
46:46 to do it twice a month uh some community
46:49 events where I invite anyone related to
46:53 let's say our freelancing uh activities
46:56 so most of the times we are already
46:58 let's say data people so I don't like to
47:00 invite people that teach us any data
47:02 skills, but often someone that tells us
47:04 about how to do branding as a um as a
47:08 freelancer or how to do maybe outreach,
47:11 how to um yeah, improve your let's say
47:14 LinkedIn uh your LinkedIn game, anything
47:16 that's more marketing related usually
47:18 because those are usually the skills
47:19 that we need and uh we want to improve.
47:22 And again yeah we don't necessarily have
47:25 the skills uh we don't develop the
47:27 skills use working full-time job right
47:30 as a I don't data engineer I don't learn
47:33 how to market myself this is something I
47:35 need to pick up if I want to be a
47:37 freelancer yeah and uh and it's always a
47:39 good exchange with uh again you have you
47:41 have the course basically that is the
47:43 foundation you know so people get the I
47:45 think I I would say the good basics
47:48 covered to understand what freelance is
47:50 about and how one should tackle it
47:52 because there's so much to it and then
47:54 there's the part where you if you want
47:56 to make it uh um reality, you have to do
48:00 the action and that's where we have
48:01 basically the community to support you
48:03 know to and also with the events to kind
48:05 of keep up and show like hey there are
48:06 other freelancers out there um that's
48:09 how they do it and and yeah and the
48:12 website is the dataf freelancer.com the
48:14 same website where you host a job board
48:17 and the freelancer rates right correct
48:21 And that's cool. Awesome. And uh I guess
48:25 this is um so we have a section here in
48:27 the questions
48:29 um of diversifying your business. And
48:31 this is one way of doing this. So the
48:33 main let's say your main focus is
48:35 working with your clients but then you
48:37 set working with your clients on
48:39 projects but then you set aside aside
48:41 some time to see what else is there. And
48:44 one of the things that came up u out of
48:47 this time is the course. Do you do
48:49 anything else?
48:51 Um, again that's a good part of
48:53 diversifying because again as I
48:54 mentioned client work is one thing. Now
48:57 basically trying to get this online
48:59 course um um a little bit more promoted.
49:02 So that's another thing. Um what I've do
49:05 as well is um it's I wouldn't call it
49:08 diversifying that much but still
49:10 improving my lifestyle business because
49:12 I used to work much more on a client
49:15 basis or much more also on uh hourly um
49:19 uh based obviously hourly pricing
49:22 projects and uh again 2023 I became a
49:26 father. So um 2024 was big learning on
49:29 because in 2024 I was doing everything
49:32 uh the same as I was doing before and I
49:34 figured out that um while you can make a
49:37 really good living I prefer to kind of
49:41 calm things down. I want to spend more
49:42 time with my family. So I I want to have
49:44 my freelancing business much more
49:46 stable. And that's what I'm currently
49:48 working on is basically um I introduced
49:51 the subscription basically subscription
49:53 model uh to my freelancing business
49:56 where I basically offer myself uh as the
50:00 data analytics let's say command center
50:03 or the data analytics oneperson team to
50:06 um uh to my clients and they basically
50:08 have full access um they can ask me
50:11 anything I uh often join some of their
50:14 meetings with the team so I can learn
50:15 also about the business But basically
50:17 I'm there 24/7 technically for them and
50:20 um it's on a subscription uh fee. We do
50:23 6 or 12 month contracts with those
50:25 clients. Uh I do them and um and yeah
50:30 and that basically is helping me um to
50:33 build something much more predictable,
50:35 stable and again uh the beauty of those
50:39 projects and I often get this asked by
50:40 people when they say don't those clients
50:43 kind of abuse you? Um uh no because the
50:47 client I work for are let's say
50:49 founderled e-commerce businesses. They
50:51 are very small e-commerce businesses uh
50:54 five to 15 people usually. Um they are
50:56 cash flow rich so they are investing a
50:58 lot of money in uh marketing activities.
51:00 They are busy with their um promoting
51:03 their business but they are not data
51:04 people. So they don't know what a data
51:06 person really does. They believe the
51:09 data can help them. Uh so they don't
51:11 have enough power to abuse me on do
51:14 this, do that, do this. Um they kind of
51:18 do this as an experiment to see if data
51:20 actually uh you know does this really
51:23 bring value and they kind of I built up
51:25 this trust with them so that they say
51:27 let's do this engagement. let's see what
51:29 you bring to uh to the table. And they
51:31 kind of want me to kind of push them.
51:33 And that's basically how that's why I
51:35 think it uh it works so well um at the
51:38 moment uh this type of business because
51:39 again I it's not like I build dashboards
51:42 every day for them. But uh it's really
51:44 much more telling them, hey, change
51:46 this, do this, and then wait for the
51:47 clients to actually do the changes. If
51:49 they don't do it right away, I have more
51:51 time to relax and do other work with
51:53 other clients. So, and I assume there
51:56 are probably some safeguards in your
51:58 contracts that prevent them from abusing
52:00 you. Um, right? So, you just tell what
52:04 kind of work you do, what kind of work
52:06 you don't don't do, right? So, if they
52:09 want to use you as a coder, um, then
52:12 maybe like it's not something you can
52:14 do. But if a consultant when you tell
52:17 them, okay, this is what you should do,
52:18 I think, then it's another thing, right?
52:21 Yes. Correct. again and I also tell them
52:23 like if I can I mean they know me and
52:25 they are a small team so it's it's they
52:27 have this relatable thing they don't
52:29 want to work with an agency because
52:30 sometimes agency is too expensive for
52:32 them it's too much for what they
52:34 actually need. So if you I position
52:36 myself as a the one freelancer for them
52:38 that's really gives them the
52:40 understanding that I can also only work
52:41 on one task at a time. So if I tell them
52:44 hey let's for example build this um
52:47 dashboard that incorporates all your
52:48 marketing activities I'll work on that
52:50 and as soon as I have that you will hear
52:52 back from me and usually so far I've
52:55 been in now four months in this to this
52:57 experiment with three clients and um
52:59 it's been great now one of them has
53:02 pushed me um actually it's fun how you
53:06 don't need data science skills but just
53:08 by very basically filtering a table and
53:12 doing in a way that they were not able
53:14 to use spot things where
53:17 um with one client that is a
53:19 subscription business basically I mean
53:21 they sell also courses on a subscription
53:23 uh mo model and one of their for example
53:26 payment uh providers had some issues or
53:30 some bug so for a couple of months they
53:32 were not pulling money from those
53:34 clients and the clients had access to
53:36 their uh course so just by looking at
53:40 the data as we data people and do it in
53:42 let's say either a spreadsheet or you
53:44 know in a notebook or whatever um on
53:46 this granular level we can spot those
53:48 things and we can highlight them and
53:50 they quickly figure out that oh we
53:53 basically lost uh 20k by not charging
53:56 people let's change this quickly you
53:58 know and that's a return on investment
54:00 for the for those small companies you
54:02 know that is uh I mean for them it's
54:05 incredible and for them it almost sounds
54:06 like magic but it's really about
54:08 understanding the client working with
54:09 them and kind of building trust and I
54:11 think That's why this um yeah the
54:14 subscription uh model works uh that well
54:17 for this type of business. I don't think
54:19 it works for all data um tasks but um
54:24 yeah and uh this reminds me of a book
54:27 called million million dollar
54:29 consulting. I don't know if it was you
54:30 who recommended me this book or it was
54:33 one of the guests of the of the podcast
54:37 and there um it's written by Alan Vice.
54:40 So Alan ah Alan Wise yeah he's one of
54:43 the godfathers of those types of books.
54:47 So one of the things he mentions there
54:49 in the book is that you can have a
54:52 retainer. You put your clients on the
54:54 retainer. So you did a project for them
54:56 but then you don't just you know part
54:59 ways. You stay on retainer and retainer
55:03 is exactly your subscription model I
55:05 think cuz they no but it looks like so
55:08 there is a project and they want you to
55:12 continue supporting this project right
55:14 and this is the retainer the retainer
55:17 usually I mean yes they are very similar
55:19 but not the same because the retainer
55:21 usually is tied to a specific let's say
55:24 uh hourly commitment for example I stick
55:26 around for 5 10 hours a month uh if you
55:31 use like you pay for them up front uh if
55:34 you use them great if not you basically
55:36 lost them and you know I'll charge you
55:38 again at the beginning of the next month
55:39 or period or whatever you want to do and
55:41 you have to pay them upfront
55:44 um which is different to when you work
55:47 hourly. Um just saying and what I do
55:50 basically is mine is not tied to the
55:53 hours I work in for the client. So the
55:55 client knows I'm there like a retainer.
55:57 The only thing is there's no hourly I
55:59 don't have to report on clients like hey
56:01 I was there for 10 hours or I was there
56:03 for you know you don't just um lock
56:06 every Friday uh in a call with me or
56:09 something like this. So, it's much more
56:10 relaxed, much more laid-back. Um,
56:12 because I didn't want to get into this
56:14 retainer model because again, if I if I
56:17 have retainer model, I only have 40
56:19 hours a week that I can sell. With this
56:21 other model, you know, I I have the
56:23 ability to basically sell more because I
56:26 I know later on how to manage the
56:28 clients. Um, and some clients again need
56:31 one hour of handholding and for them
56:33 it's such a value. For the other client,
56:35 they need 10 hours of handholding and
56:37 it's less value. So it really depends on
56:40 the client and that's why I I call it
56:42 also more subscription because again
56:43 it's a retainer but not tied to ours.
56:46 Mhm. Yeah. And I think one of the other
56:48 things I remember from this book is
56:49 again we talked about you mentioned
56:51 early rates. And so this is something
56:53 that you are trying to get away uh get
56:57 um like how to say stay away from like
57:00 move to other models. And this is what
57:03 he's also talking about um in the book
57:05 that you you need to try to package your
57:09 projects as a
57:10 like a package right you say okay this
57:14 is what I do and this is how much it
57:15 will cost and then uh you don't do this
57:18 by hours you do it by delivering a
57:21 project which I guess is thicker right I
57:25 mean this is how it feels to me I feel
57:27 like
57:30 I feel like that's um I I mean it makes
57:33 sense that uh if you work on an hourly
57:35 basis um there's only so much that you
57:38 can make unless of course you can bump
57:40 up your price that's that's the the
57:42 other variable that you can basically
57:44 make more um whereas if you sell it as a
57:47 project you know um you know how much
57:50 you spend uh in the project so
57:52 technically your margins are much bigger
57:54 um and that's usually what uh and also
57:57 working on an hourly base if I want to
57:59 make more money from a client I want to
58:01 work more hours for them. Um and
58:04 basically it uh rewards inefficiency
58:06 because someone who's really good and
58:08 really fast and wants to move on to
58:09 another project, they will earn less. So
58:11 from that sense um that's what all the
58:14 let's say the
58:16 um the experts consultants say you know
58:19 go away from the hourly um uh model. But
58:23 I also have the opinion that it's
58:27 a it's a it's a way or it's a mentality
58:32 of going away from hourly. It's easy be
58:35 it's easy to be said but harder to be
58:37 done. Um and I don't hate hourly. I
58:41 think they have a time and place and um
58:44 if it's useful especially for someone
58:47 who wants to get started and the client
58:48 only wants to do hourly um uh hourly uh
58:53 um basically the pricing model. Why why
58:57 do you want to put that project in
58:59 jeopardy if that's one of your first
59:00 project and it gets you paid and it's a
59:02 trustworthy client. It's just the way
59:04 they prefer um to handle things
59:06 sometimes like this. Hey, go go go the
59:08 hourly. There's no shame in it. you
59:10 know, it's it's totally fine and even
59:12 sometimes there are some projects where
59:13 you don't know exactly um how to manage
59:17 uh how much input it needs from your
59:18 site. So, it's totally fine to go with
59:20 hourly. But yes, in theory, if you want
59:23 to make more money, have greater
59:25 margins, um the hourly is the least
59:28 efficient one. And I just noticed that
59:31 we actually have a question from the
59:33 audience and I did not notice it. Uh
59:35 Dimmitri, do you have like maybe Sure,
59:37 sure, sure. Yeah. Okay. So then I'll get
59:41 to ask this question. Now I have a
59:44 suspicion that we might have discussed
59:46 already in the previous episode and by
59:48 the way I have just sent the previous
59:50 episode in the live chat. I will also
59:51 put it in the description uh of this
59:54 video but let me ask the question
59:55 anyways. How do you transition into
59:58 freelancing with a notice period of 3
1:00:00 months? So in Germany this is very
1:00:01 typical when you work at a company uh
1:00:04 you give a notice and then you still
1:00:06 have to stay with the company for 3
1:00:08 months and it works both ways. So if a
1:00:09 company wants to fire you then you get
1:00:12 to stick uh around or at least get three
1:00:15 months worth of salary right. So most of
1:00:18 the projects require short-term
1:00:20 availability and actually I also had a
1:00:22 conversation with the recruiter like
1:00:23 that. So the recruiter contacted me and
1:00:26 he said look I have a project and then
1:00:28 he quoted like I don't know 1,000 per
1:00:31 day or something like this. So it was a
1:00:34 very good rate. Uh but then there was a
1:00:37 catch that I need to be available right
1:00:39 now and I was not like and I said okay
1:00:42 look I can quit my job and then I need
1:00:44 to wait for 3 months and then he said
1:00:46 nobody will wait for 3 months like and I
1:00:49 asked okay what can I do and he said
1:00:51 well you can quit now and then contact
1:00:53 me in 3 months and I'm like nah
1:00:56 nope so how do you deal do you deal with
1:00:59 this uh problem?
1:01:02 Um well let's say the way I did it is I
1:01:07 quit had the notice period I think even
1:01:09 at that time I had I had a uglier
1:01:11 contract so I think even I had six month
1:01:13 uh of period I believe but uh anyways uh
1:01:17 you quit your job and um uh what you can
1:01:21 do some people they have they are lucky
1:01:25 and they they are on a very good terms
1:01:28 with their company so they can ask the
1:01:30 company Hey, I really want to go
1:01:32 freelance. That's the way I want to do
1:01:33 it. Um, I want to quit, but um, instead
1:01:37 of losing me after 3 months, why don't I
1:01:39 stick around as and you become my first
1:01:41 client. If that's if that's a
1:01:44 possibility for you, I think that's a
1:01:46 very secure way of then quitting your
1:01:48 job.
1:01:50 Um, else if you work especially in
1:01:52 contracting, as you said, they want
1:01:54 they're looking a client is looking for
1:01:56 someone and you're looking for someone
1:01:58 right now, not at 3 months. uh so
1:02:00 therefore um that's a little bit harder
1:02:03 but what you can do I think and that's
1:02:04 the part that I uh go into in depth in
1:02:08 my course is really the research part of
1:02:10 becoming a freelancer and especially if
1:02:13 you're based in Europe or Germany which
1:02:14 is the largest company in Europe uh the
1:02:17 largest country in Europe basically for
1:02:19 contracting work is um you want to reach
1:02:22 out to those recruiters as soon as
1:02:25 possible you want to show them your
1:02:27 profile you want to get you're really
1:02:29 like on the phone with them and ask them
1:02:30 like uh do you see projects um popping
1:02:33 up for my type of profile? Um how should
1:02:35 I improve my CV or my profile uh in
1:02:38 order to land more clients? You want to
1:02:39 get this feedback because those people
1:02:41 are people that are again in touch with
1:02:43 the with the clients. They have a really
1:02:45 good market sense and they can give you
1:02:47 the feedback. And at that time when I
1:02:49 was um handing in my resignation, I got
1:02:53 so much feedback that everyone was
1:02:54 saying like oh I see projects every
1:02:56 every day. Look at this. If if you were
1:02:58 a freelancer today, I would apply or
1:03:00 would introduce you to these three
1:03:02 companies or four companies and that
1:03:04 gave me confidence. Um, of course in
1:03:06 four month or five month things can
1:03:08 change but that's a little bit you know
1:03:10 the the research risk you know that's uh
1:03:12 that we cannot predict uh how the market
1:03:15 will change uh in the future but even in
1:03:17 my case I started in uh 2019 and then
1:03:20 again in the beginning of 2020 we were
1:03:22 hit with a co pandemic where most
1:03:24 companies cut the contracts with all
1:03:27 their external partners and I still
1:03:28 managed to get a I had a really really
1:03:31 good year that year.
1:03:32 So, I think it's really about can you
1:03:35 get uh anyone in your network or your
1:03:38 current employer to kind of agree to
1:03:40 becoming your client and maybe you're
1:03:43 better off signing uh some contract like
1:03:45 this. Um you could also spend some time
1:03:49 on let's say either from your network or
1:03:52 let's say places like Upwork or
1:03:54 something like this on those places to
1:03:56 slowly build up your um uh reputation on
1:03:59 small projects. um that will give you
1:04:01 also a good uh feeling. Um, and yeah, I
1:04:04 think that's that's the most secure way
1:04:07 because yes, like I was doing something
1:04:10 risky, but I don't think it was that
1:04:13 risky because I did the research, you
1:04:14 know, I I I I got the feedback from um
1:04:18 uh from the recruiters. I identified
1:04:21 other freelancers and that's the beauty
1:04:22 of the my data freelancer community is
1:04:24 that you join and you know that there
1:04:27 are other freelancers in Germany, in
1:04:28 France, in the UK, you know, or in
1:04:30 Spain, you know, that are making it as a
1:04:32 living. So you can reach out to them,
1:04:33 you can talk to them and they usually we
1:04:35 are friendly group. We take the time to
1:04:37 meet up with people and we also have our
1:04:39 events. So we get together, we talk
1:04:41 about this and everyone from beginner to
1:04:43 pro, you know, contributes or ask
1:04:45 questions and I mean it's it's it's it's
1:04:48 a lifelong uh learning basically. So but
1:04:52 at the end of the day you still need to
1:04:53 take this leap of fa faith and do it
1:04:56 right like cuz uh yeah otherwise you
1:05:00 cannot do this. Yes, but it's the risk
1:05:03 like you could switch uh to a new
1:05:06 company and get laid off, you know,
1:05:07 during your uh uh during the probation
1:05:10 period, you know, sometimes and
1:05:11 especially over I think the last two
1:05:12 years there were lots of layoffs. So
1:05:15 sometimes we argue that is being an
1:05:17 employee like an employee really that
1:05:19 secure because if they want to get rid
1:05:21 of you because there are pro there
1:05:23 there's some issues they they do that.
1:05:25 Yeah. Okay, Dimmitri, thanks a lot uh
1:05:28 for answering your questions. Thanks a
