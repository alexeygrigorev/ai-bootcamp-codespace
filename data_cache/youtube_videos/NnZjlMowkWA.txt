1:42 anyways
1:43 okay so it means you're ready right
1:46 I'm ready man boom ready
1:51 okay this week we'll talk about
1:52 preparing for a technical data science
1:54 interview and we have a special guest
1:56 today look look is a co-founder of
1:58 neural AI a company that specializes in
2:01 recruiting data scientists and other AI
2:03 professionals he has over 10 years of
2:05 experience working with the recruiter
2:07 and
2:09 what is more Luke is also at podcasts
2:12 podcast post so he's posting the AI game
2:16 changer
2:17 pleasure to have you
2:19 pleasure to be here man for the second
2:21 time I feel like you and I we just do
2:25 podcast episodes with each other now we
2:27 really need to get out of the guests I
2:28 think exactly yeah I was going to
2:31 mention that Luke is actually second
2:33 time today so Luke is one of our very
2:36 first guests thank you for like third or
2:39 fourth I don't remember like but it was
2:42 last time
2:44 I interviewed her with you it was two
2:46 years ago when data talks about podcasts
2:48 just started it's been a while and yeah
2:51 before we actually start I want to
2:52 mention that the questions for today's
2:54 interview are prepared by Johanna Empire
2:57 so thanks Johanna for account and let's
3:00 start so Luke tell us what's up what
3:03 you've been up to since uh with sport
3:06 last time yeah
3:08 um yeah maybe also tell us a few words
3:11 about yourself before that yeah so um
3:13 maybe I can give you in the listeners a
3:15 bit of background about me so um as you
3:18 quite broadly mentioned I've been in
3:19 recruitment for uh well over a decade
3:22 now so
3:23 um I've got the gray hairs and the
3:25 Crow's eyes fee uh to prove it
3:28 um but historically I used to help
3:29 companies find data professionals but
3:32 more from kind of like a traditional bi
3:35 descriptive analytics you kind of focus
3:39 um but over the past 10 years that's
3:40 kind of transitioned and I've kind of
3:42 worked with the market so over the past
3:45 maybe six years now I would say that
3:47 I've had three key focuses so number one
3:51 um machine learning or deep learning at
3:54 the core of all of the engineering highs
3:56 I've made and obviously that would
3:58 encapsulate all of the other bits around
4:00 that so traditional data science or data
4:02 engineering and everything else in
4:04 between
4:05 um
4:06 I've worked pretty much exclusively
4:08 exclusively with early to mid-stage
4:11 startups
4:13 um so I don't do much in the corporate
4:14 space anymore as I say I tend to work
4:17 with smaller organizations that really
4:19 need me
4:21 um and then lastly
4:23 I do most of my work in Germany I'd say
4:26 that 90 of my work is in Germany
4:28 um but since the pandemic I've kind of
4:31 broadened out to kind of Central Europe
4:33 as a whole but I've still got my kind of
4:35 core client base in uh in Germany so
4:38 yeah that's me
4:40 um
4:42 no I mean Ken if anyone knows where that
4:45 is it's a really beautiful part of the
4:47 UK so uh yeah I don't know if you can
4:50 see actually but the background I've
4:51 just had the office uh renovated and
4:53 stuff so uh yeah really happy about that
4:57 I'm just curious how does it happen that
5:00 the recruiters from the UK work in
5:02 Germany
5:04 well this is a bit of a long story
5:08 that's the only equator from the UK who
5:11 works in Germany like it's quite a trend
5:13 I don't know actually many Germans
5:16 yeah um so the story is I'll try and
5:19 condense this as much as I can so I
5:21 can't remember what it was but I don't
5:24 know what year it was but long story
5:25 short I was moving to Australia and in
5:27 the time I joined the company in
5:28 Australia and in the time period of me
5:30 waiting for my visas to come look why
5:33 don't you join us and work with our
5:35 German business and help us do some
5:36 business development and win some
5:38 clients and do some recruitment in
5:40 Germany and call it the interim of you
5:42 moving over to Australia
5:44 in that interim period I met Rachel
5:46 who's my co-founder girlfriend
5:49 and life partner
5:52 um and uh yeah as I say it got to a
5:54 stage where I was like well I've got to
5:56 move into Australia and blah blah blah
5:58 so uh yeah long story short it kind of
6:01 worked out that actually I just stayed
6:02 in the UK and I really enjoyed working
6:04 with German clients and German people in
6:06 general so
6:07 um so yeah it just continued from there
6:09 that was a very convinced version but
6:11 yeah serendipitous I guess but um yeah
6:14 it was cool man
6:16 okay
6:17 um do you remember what we spoke two
6:19 years ago
6:22 standing out as a data scientist was the
6:24 topic right but it wasn't that big yeah
6:26 yeah the specifics man you're gonna have
6:28 to remind me I don't remember but uh
6:32 yeah what video we're up to this little
6:35 change
6:37 um
6:39 yeah I mean um to be honest with like
6:42 not much has changed since we last spoke
6:44 in terms of what I do on a day-to-day
6:46 um I think now as a individual and a
6:50 business I feel a lot more like embedded
6:51 into the community like obviously I've
6:53 been running a podcast
6:55 um I've already released a lot of
6:57 content on a weekly basis and I feel
6:58 like I'm much more well known in the
7:00 industry now than what it was three four
7:03 five years ago
7:04 um I think that's largely due to
7:06 [Music]
7:12 as well but I think largely when I used
7:16 to work for other organizations that
7:18 were
7:19 um a lot more corporate and bigger
7:22 um I had to kind of be a recruiter for
7:24 that business but now I feel like I can
7:27 be exactly who I am and all of my
7:29 content and what I do and how I work
7:31 with customers and people
7:33 um it reflects that
7:35 so um yeah I feel like I'm just much
7:38 more
7:38 like much more bone Loan in the industry
7:40 now than what I was when we we first
7:42 spoke
7:43 um but yeah as I say I think that's
7:45 largely due to just being able to be
7:47 myself and do what I do
7:49 um without having
7:51 Ultra amounts of pressure from directors
7:53 and the organization to make placements
7:56 at all costs
7:58 um so yeah but I mean on a day-to-day
8:00 basis man I do Recruitment and I work
8:02 with my customers and we make placements
8:03 and it's some really good fun but um
8:05 yeah as I say it's been fun I mean
8:09 did we talk at the beginning of the
8:11 pandemic I can't remember when we
8:13 actually recorded that podcast but that
8:15 was probably the worst thing to your
8:17 recruitment career yeah so two years ago
8:19 so now it's 2023 right it was 2021
8:23 January yeah so we we'd probably just
8:27 come out of the worst year of my
8:28 recruitment career
8:30 um and we were probably just stepping
8:31 into the best year of our recruitment
8:32 career so
8:33 um yeah it's been fun man it's been good
8:38 so I typically hear that so tell us
8:41 about your podcast
8:43 uh yeah so the podcast was spun off of
8:47 um
8:48 in the midst of the pandemic my job
8:51 became pretty redundant uh I mean I
8:54 didn't know many companies that were
8:56 hiring and the ones that were were
8:59 definitely not using external
9:01 Headhunters to find Talent so for
9:03 probably about nine months
9:05 I just I was like [ __ ] I just don't know
9:08 what I'm going to do now because most
9:09 companies don't want to use me and
9:13 it's all I'm known for right so what
9:14 what am I going to do
9:16 um so yeah the podcast found out I've
9:18 learned in that time period I need to do
9:20 something for the community
9:23 um right now I can't offer them jobs I
9:25 can't help them get into jobs
9:27 so what I was going to do and I've
9:29 always toyed with the idea of running a
9:31 podcast but um to be honest it was kind
9:33 of always like a side note for me like
9:36 if I get time to do it then it'll be
9:37 something I will do but
9:40 um yeah it kind of always been pushed it
9:41 aside so
9:43 um yeah I think 2020 was the best chance
9:44 to kind of launch something like that
9:46 and um yeah I'm really glad I did so
9:49 it's really cool
9:51 um again I just talked to AI
9:54 um data science and machine learning
9:55 learning leaders in Germany and Central
9:57 Europe about their journey within
10:00 um the space that we were working
10:01 [Music]
10:03 um typically I'll talk to like early
10:04 stage Founders and we'll talk about
10:07 their Journey from the first initial
10:09 concept
10:11 um up to where they are today and their
10:13 journey to get there
10:14 um so yeah it's going well man
10:16 um but yeah to be honest like after
10:19 after the pandemic work like completely
10:22 exploded so I take a bit of a backseat
10:24 on the podcast for a bit
10:26 um
10:26 which was probably not my best decision
10:29 because we got it up to a really good
10:30 stage and then I kind of dipped off
10:32 because I was just so busy with work
10:35 um and now we're gradually getting it
10:36 back up there now so we run everything
10:38 on video now and um yeah it's a slightly
10:40 different angle than what we had before
10:42 but um yeah if anyone's Keen
10:46 the difference between what you do and
10:48 what I do is that yours is very
10:51 practical right people can actually
10:52 learn from the data tools Club podcast
10:55 in one way shape or form
10:57 my podcast is a little bit more about
10:59 stories so I really want to explain kind
11:01 of the Journey of organizations and give
11:03 people
11:05 um an opportunity to kind of share their
11:07 story what the business does
11:10 um and ultimately just like illuminate
11:11 the companies that are working in the AI
11:14 community in Germany
11:16 um so yeah if you're interested in
11:18 stories maybe not necessarily learning
11:20 but like interesting conversations then
11:22 it's probably cool to check it out but
11:24 if you want to learn stuff stick with
11:26 Alexa
11:26 [Music]
11:28 one does not exclude another right yeah
11:31 wondering if we look at the number of
11:33 podcasts three over a year or like each
11:36 year and there must be a spike in 2020
11:39 right because this is where data talks
11:41 about podcast also started
11:43 apparently everyone was like okay
11:45 pandemic what do we do let's start yeah
11:48 it's probably like boredom had a bit of
11:51 Parts playing in that right it's just
11:52 something to do but I don't know if it's
11:55 just boredom but I don't need to be
11:57 connected maybe
11:59 yeah yeah
12:01 okay so well we said during the pandemic
12:05 times you wanted to do something for the
12:08 community but you couldn't help them get
12:09 jobs so you decided to do a podcast but
12:12 now you can actually help them get jobs
12:15 right so how do you do this
12:18 um so clients typically work with me on
12:21 positions that they find really
12:23 difficult to fill so
12:26 um traditional kind of data science
12:28 positions I don't get a lot of work in
12:30 that kind of space anymore usually what
12:33 happens with most markets is
12:36 um as new things come into
12:39 the machine learning data Science World
12:40 there are fewer and fewer people at the
12:42 beginning of that kind of bell curve
12:44 right of
12:45 um uh like that particular thing so
12:48 usually
12:49 um clients work with me right at the
12:51 beginning of like new things that
12:53 happening in the market so to give you
12:55 an example like mlops is a really hot
12:57 topic for me right now
12:59 um most companies that I'm working with
13:01 are looking for someone or people to
13:02 help with like infrastructure and the
13:04 operational side of ml
13:06 um but if you ask me that like the
13:08 typical roles that I recruit for like
13:10 five six years ago I'd say data
13:11 scientists Big Data Engineers
13:14 um so my role kind of transitioned with
13:16 the market
13:18 um but yeah customers work with me to
13:20 find Niche hard to find people
13:23 um and my role essentially is an
13:27 intermediary between the customer and
13:30 the individuals I'm representing so in a
13:33 slightly different way than what most of
13:37 the recruitment industry works like
13:39 I only work with two to three customers
13:41 in [ __ ] I'm only one person so
13:44 I can't work with 100 customers in one
13:47 satellite I just wouldn't be able to
13:48 service them
13:50 um but yeah so I work with two to three
13:52 customers at once and I work really
13:54 really closely with them so the way that
13:56 I typically try and frame it with those
13:58 customers is that I'm your embedded AI
14:00 Talent specialist for the time that
14:03 we're working on a particular project
14:04 together
14:06 um but externally with the candidates
14:08 that I represent
14:10 I try and be as involved in the job
14:14 search with the individuals that I work
14:15 with as possible so what I don't want to
14:18 do is just be kind of like a a job
14:20 filterer for people to just send them
14:22 job specs and just coordinate interviews
14:24 that's really not what I want to do what
14:28 I actually this is going to sound a bit
14:29 cheesy but what I really want to kind of
14:31 become and be known for is that
14:33 I'm a seminar career coach that does
14:36 sound super cheesy but ultimately I
14:38 think if you've ever worked with with me
14:40 before
14:41 um you'll know that I pretty much help
14:43 you with every single stage of the
14:45 process be that the intro stage be that
14:49 technical
14:50 um how to speak to VPS and like Senior
14:52 Management offer negotiation and closing
14:56 and pretty much I'll hold your hand
14:58 through the entire into process from the
15:00 very very get-go
15:02 um and I'll pretty much walk people
15:03 through the stages within all of the
15:05 companies I work with so
15:07 um yeah if you've ever worked with me
15:08 before I hope you would agree with that
15:11 um but yeah so as I say I work pretty
15:14 much in the middle between customers and
15:15 candidates
15:17 um but what I try to do is work really
15:19 really closely with the people that I
15:21 work with
15:23 I cannot say publicly if I worked with
15:26 you
15:33 should go through each of these like you
15:36 said that it's intro stage technical
15:38 stage talking to management negotiation
15:40 I definitely want to cover all that but
15:42 before that
15:44 very interesting question
15:46 so now the market for all the tech jobs
15:49 seem to be like
15:52 a ghost
15:54 sound right I mean what I want to say is
15:56 like I see companies doing layoffs uh
15:59 getting a joke is harder
16:02 um like there are now the market is
16:04 shifting from the candidates
16:07 being a candidates Market to the
16:09 company's market so
16:11 it's harder and harder to find positions
16:13 for you as a recruiter what changed in
16:16 the last six months
16:19 um
16:20 I can only talk from my own personal
16:22 experience but being really honest I've
16:25 not noticed any difference okay
16:27 um in big Tech yes of course
16:29 everything's on fire at the moment
16:31 there's tons of layoffs happening and no
16:33 doubt people are already affected by
16:35 that but the work that I do right now
16:40 honestly it's not it's not any different
16:43 um I mean this week
16:45 I've brought on well I mean there are
16:48 potentially another two to three
16:49 customers that want to work with me
16:51 right now
16:52 um so I'm still at capacity all the time
16:55 um that says you know I don't work with
16:56 everyone so I might have a very small
16:59 window and what the market actually
17:00 looks like
17:02 um but for me that meant like
17:05 I mean the customers that I'm working
17:06 with are still hiring
17:08 um they've got the funding to do so
17:10 maybe I'm just lucky in the fact that
17:13 the customers I do work with are in
17:14 really good positions like no doubt
17:18 um there's different stories across the
17:19 whole Market but for me personally
17:22 um it's pretty good I mean touchwoods uh
17:26 I hope that continues
17:29 um but yeah as I say man like right now
17:31 well I mean I feel like I'm in a pretty
17:33 good position and I feel like the
17:34 clients I'm working with are in pretty
17:35 good positions
17:37 um so it's really difficult because I
17:39 don't know the entire market right but
17:41 this small subsection of the clients I
17:43 work with and who I know are in the
17:45 market
17:48 um seems fairly similar
17:51 um bar a couple of little events that
17:53 have happened but
17:54 generally
17:55 [Music]
17:57 I can see the market kind of bouncing
17:59 back within the next couple of this like
18:00 I've seen this happen throughout my
18:02 career at pretty much every single
18:04 company that I work with to get huge
18:06 layoffs
18:07 um there's tons of [ __ ] on LinkedIn
18:09 about the markets and fire and there's
18:10 going to be a huge recession period and
18:12 stuff
18:13 um and then in six months time
18:14 everything is kind of back to normal so
18:17 um I'm not I'm not worried about what's
18:20 happening out there I guess but um maybe
18:22 that's super naive and really ignorant
18:24 but
18:25 um yeah from where I'm sitting right now
18:26 man the Market's still on fire
18:27 especially if you're good at what you do
18:30 um I mean there's always going to be
18:31 opportunities if if it's not there it's
18:34 going to be somewhere else right
18:36 um so yeah I mean from where I'm sitting
18:38 man it seems pretty good but I people
18:41 are probably shaking their head at me
18:42 right now and thinking well you don't
18:44 know what I know but
18:45 um I don't so yeah well it's good to be
18:49 an optimistic
19:00 budgets are still the same right so they
19:03 are not reducing budget so you can the
19:05 candidates can still get salary it's the
19:07 same salaries they were getting
19:09 previously you still have clients
19:11 clients have money
19:13 um they are in a good position so for
19:15 now you don't see any business for it
19:17 I don't think we've seen the full like
19:20 flow down effect of what's happened in
19:21 my it's too early to say right now right
19:24 um so it could be a very very different
19:27 Market in the next six months
19:29 um what I know right now is that not
19:31 much has changed from my side
19:34 um
19:35 so yeah I'm not really seeing any kind
19:37 of electrical down effects just yet what
19:39 that looks like in six to 12 months I'm
19:41 not sure
19:42 um
19:43 well what about um like maybe it became
19:46 easier to close positions because there
19:48 are more and it's on the market or still
19:50 for the positions you work
19:52 um on it's asparagus
19:56 like nothing yeah yeah
20:01 like you know we wouldn't I don't think
20:03 I would have a job if it ever became
20:05 easy because what like if there were a
20:08 huge influx of candidates on the market
20:09 that made them redundant and
20:12 um people would get them directly right
20:13 and they would just hire them directly
20:15 but I think the True Value in working
20:17 with a heads Hunter is not necessarily
20:19 the presentation of candidates
20:21 um it's much more about the kind of
20:23 process ownership from end to end both
20:25 from a client and from a candidate
20:27 perspective so
20:29 um there might be more
20:31 people on the market right now
20:33 um
20:35 but then there's still the same amount
20:37 of competition going after that Talent
20:39 so that doesn't change
20:41 um I mean it's a bit messy right now
20:43 right I don't you know I don't know
20:45 exactly how that's going to kind of
20:46 transition over the next six to 12
20:48 months but
20:49 um
20:50 yeah for me I've not I've really not
20:52 seen anything where I'm like oh [ __ ]
20:54 this is a big change so to give me an
20:57 example
20:59 when covered here that was the biggest
21:01 shock of my entire career where I was
21:03 like this is
21:05 awful we could potentially go out of
21:07 business and I could run out of money
21:09 and right now we're looking at the
21:12 client pipeline that we have
21:14 um just what's happening like generally
21:15 the energy in the market
21:18 if anything I'd probably hear a little
21:20 bit more from a candidate perspective
21:23 they're a little bit more apprehensive
21:25 about going to startups and companies
21:27 that don't necessarily have
21:29 um a route to profitability and they're
21:31 very
21:32 um there's a lot more questions that are
21:35 uh focusables are funding and stability
21:37 and stuff like that that I didn't really
21:40 get in 2021 I did but not as much as now
21:45 um so it's probably a little bit more
21:47 kind of like Risk on the side of the
21:49 candidates right now but generally
21:51 um as I say compared I compare
21:53 everything to covered now right and I'm
21:55 just like is it as bad as March 2020 no
21:59 so it's
22:00 it's not too bad let's see okay well the
22:05 topic today is a technical interview
22:07 right just
22:09 I think there is and he said that you as
22:12 a recruiter you're quite involved in the
22:14 interview process and what you do you
22:18 help the candidates at every stage which
22:21 you mentioned introduction stage then
22:23 technical interview then speaking with
22:26 top management like the P directors and
22:30 then finally the negotiation stage so
22:32 can you walk us through the stages what
22:35 happens at which the stages and how do
22:37 you help and events yeah
22:39 yeah
22:41 um
22:42 that's quite I want to work out where we
22:45 need to start with that so people don't
22:47 get like kind of like overwhelmed with
22:49 information because if we do the whole
22:50 thing it so if we kind of break that
22:53 down I guess and we just do one stage at
22:55 a time
22:56 um because personally I think that
22:57 there's different expectations for like
23:00 obviously all of those stages right and
23:02 I think the prep needs to be Associated
23:04 to what we're trying to achieve in the
23:05 individual stages so
23:08 um I think if we just make some
23:10 assumptions now right because I'm going
23:11 to talk really broadly and this isn't
23:15 necessarily there are going to be some
23:17 companies out there where this doesn't
23:19 it's not going to make sense and there
23:21 are going to be some situations where
23:22 they're a bit abstract and a bit
23:24 left-wing and
23:25 um I think the challenge with interviews
23:28 is is that if you interview a hundred
23:30 different companies you'll probably get
23:32 100 different experiences right or at
23:34 least 50. so
23:37 take everything that I'm saying now with
23:39 like a pinch of salt and I think I put a
23:42 post out not too long ago about if
23:44 anyone wants this document then I'll
23:46 happily send that to them and if anyone
23:48 wants to talk to me about it directly
23:50 um and ask me specific questions about
23:51 specific interview processes that I'm
23:54 more than happy to help
23:55 um but so anyway just that's a bit of a
23:58 caveat but I think the assumptions that
24:00 I would make not that I've made are
24:03 this is pretty much focused on what's
24:05 kind of Junior to senior ish level hires
24:07 right anything principal lead management
24:11 uh any of those kinds of highs that's a
24:14 different level of prep and different
24:16 levels of expectations so I'm kind of
24:19 push that to one side
24:21 um number two is that in the interviews
24:23 you're going to you're actually capable
24:25 of doing that role and it's a logical
24:26 step so you can't if you're a junior
24:29 engineer in your program for a CTO role
24:31 I mean you can prep until your eyes fall
24:33 out but that's probably not going to
24:34 happen right so number two the roles
24:37 that you're interviewing for you're
24:38 capable of doing
24:39 um it's a role that you want not just an
24:42 interview
24:43 um and the process is fairly standard so
24:48 I mean what three stages intro technical
24:51 final stage Senior Management VP ish
24:55 kind of
24:57 uh interview that's typically what I see
25:00 maybe two stages in the technical part
25:02 but generally that's the kind of process
25:05 um
25:06 and then yeah the last kind of
25:07 assumption that I make is that you're
25:08 working with someone who's semi-decent
25:10 at giving you some information so you're
25:12 working with either a good recruiter
25:15 um a good internal person and you know a
25:18 good HR person internally or the manager
25:21 that you're working with from a
25:23 technical side of things is a good
25:24 person
25:25 um
25:26 or the founder or whatever but you've
25:28 got a contact that's associated to that
25:30 business that you can strip information
25:32 from in some sort of way it's not always
25:34 the case but nine times out of ten
25:36 there'll be someone in that chain that
25:38 you'd be able to speak to right
25:42 um does that make sense I feel like I've
25:44 rambled my way through that but uh maybe
25:47 we can go to the actual stages right
25:49 yeah yeah yeah yeah do you think they're
25:51 fair or something but yeah of course so
25:54 um
25:55 so the intro meeting is obviously going
25:57 to be obviously the first stage but it's
25:59 all coming together right or
26:02 um I don't class me as a stage in the
26:04 interview process so it's like stage
26:07 zero sort of like the chat with your the
26:09 initial one when you reach out to bid
26:11 you say okay I'm working with this
26:13 client I have this awesome role how
26:16 about him right yeah that's fine you
26:19 reach out then you have a conversation
26:21 that's like stage zero then you
26:23 understand okay the candidate wants to
26:24 move uh to to try this position right
26:27 and
26:28 you
26:30 what do you do you show this the CD of
26:33 the candidate to the company they said
26:35 okay let's interview that person
26:37 and then you arrange the interview and
26:39 then this is where the introduction the
26:41 intro stage happens right yeah correct
26:45 um so typically well I mean the
26:47 companies that I work with now
26:49 I've worked with them for quite some
26:51 time so usually I'll just put people in
26:53 onto the Diaries because I've got such a
26:55 good understanding of what they're
26:56 looking for
26:58 um I'll send the CV as you know just to
27:01 be polite just be like hey man I'm
27:02 booking this guy in with you
27:04 um
27:05 if you've got any questions let me know
27:06 but I'm kind of at a stage now where the
27:09 customers I work with I just know them
27:11 inside out so
27:13 um there's not really there's not really
27:15 much guesswork in terms of the work that
27:17 I do now but anyway yeah exactly so the
27:19 way that you should look at me is I'm a
27:22 filter between the client the end client
27:25 and the candidate so
27:28 um I'm not an interview like for me I
27:30 really want to understand what makes you
27:32 tick as a candidate right because you
27:34 might say some things to me that I think
27:36 do you know what them that's not going
27:38 to work with this customer or that's not
27:39 going to work and that's not the right
27:41 role for you so there's going to be
27:43 better opportunities out there that will
27:44 give you that kind of thing that you're
27:46 looking for right and then vice versa
27:48 if there's
27:50 Parts about the cultural fit or if
27:52 there's Parts about the technical skills
27:53 that I know that they definitely need
27:56 um that are going to be like an instant
27:57 reject then that's my job to not put
28:00 forward people that are just totally
28:01 irrelevant right so
28:03 um that's where I said so um yeah first
28:06 stage is obviously always going to be
28:07 the intro meeting right
28:10 um again there are going to be different
28:12 ways that companies run this but
28:14 typically what 30 40 minutes of
28:17 conversation and I guess the key thing
28:20 that most people are trying to get to in
28:22 the intro stage of an interview is is
28:26 there Synergy between us as an
28:28 organization the role that we have open
28:30 and from a personal perspective does
28:32 this make sense right
28:35 um that's kind of the main goal but from
28:37 both sides so the prep of that I mean if
28:42 you've got any specific questions that
28:43 you want me to answer about that or
28:45 yeah like what does it look like is it
28:48 uh like tell us about yourself or
28:51 there is more structure yeah so I guess
28:54 we'll get into the well the typical
28:57 questions that I see in that are really
28:59 broad open-ended questions like that
29:01 right
29:03 um but if we're talking about prep
29:05 specifically
29:07 for me I think it breaks down into
29:10 three four elements so number one the
29:16 person and character that you're going
29:18 to be speaking to because ultimately in
29:20 an intro meeting as much as it's about
29:22 outlining the skills of who you are and
29:25 what you do it's about building the
29:27 relationship with that person because if
29:29 you get off a call with someone and you
29:31 have that kind of internal feeling like
29:33 yeah kind of that's kind of the thing
29:36 that we're looking for from both sides
29:37 but he she was a dick then that's not
29:41 really going to go past that first
29:42 initial stage right so Point number one
29:45 is about the character that you're going
29:47 to be speaking to and the relationship
29:48 between those people
29:50 Point number two is
29:52 sorry go ahead I'm just starting to
29:55 understand like how does it help me as a
29:57 candidate like uh okay I know that the
30:00 person I will be speaking to is I don't
30:03 know data science manager in this
30:05 company
30:06 so what are my actions like do I
30:08 research them on LinkedIn do I think
30:11 what is interesting to them like do I
30:15 um like the way I told to tell my story
30:18 I use the same language that they relate
30:21 to they they would relate to or how do I
30:23 how do I use this information yeah so
30:26 there are two elements to that so it's
30:29 the pre the the free research and the
30:33 immediate things that you do on the call
30:34 with that person right so if I was going
30:36 to interview with you Alexa I mean
30:39 you're a brilliant example of someone
30:41 that you can actually research
30:43 um yeah a lot of people it is difficult
30:45 but the first thing I do is I really try
30:47 and understand the person that I'm going
30:50 to speak to so number one I would ask
30:52 the recruiter the internal person that
30:55 I'm working with what's a Lexi like like
30:57 really really simply what kind of
30:59 characteristics does Alexa have or some
31:02 type of communication style or so let's
31:04 you got I really want to try and gauge
31:06 who you are before we jump on the course
31:08 there's as little surprises as possible
31:11 um so the person internally that you
31:13 work with or externally as a header
31:14 Center I would be stripping that person
31:17 for information because
31:19 I want to know that when I jump on that
31:21 call is this guy going to be an
31:23 extroverted hands wavy in the air kind
31:25 of person is he going to be super direct
31:27 and just get straight to the point like
31:29 what type of character and rights are
31:31 you actually going to be speaking to
31:32 here because I think that the key thing
31:35 that you need to do in that scenario is
31:38 you really need to kind of work with the
31:41 person that you're talking to so if
31:43 we've got an ultra direct straight to
31:45 the point manager of something and you
31:48 go in there and you want to kind of
31:50 shoot the breeze You're just going to
31:51 annoy that person but then equally if
31:54 it's the other way around and you're
31:55 super direct and you just like want to
31:57 get straight to the point and get to it
31:58 but the other person is like hey man
32:00 Mike how's your day going like yeah
32:01 would you get up until the weekend if
32:04 you don't match or try to at least match
32:06 the energy of the person that you're
32:08 speaking to
32:10 there's going to be friction and the
32:12 point I'm trying to make about
32:13 researching the person before you
32:15 actually jump into the interview is
32:17 there are a lot of signals in terms of
32:19 how people communicate so it would be
32:21 very easy to work you out because you've
32:23 got podcasts so
32:25 you can watch them and you can see how
32:26 you can communicate right but doesn't
32:29 mean they behave like that yeah right
32:32 I probably I probably have no problem
32:35 yeah I would imagine you probably do but
32:40 maybe there there would be a slight gear
32:43 shift but I would say that eighty
32:45 percent
32:47 um but anyway so the way that people
32:49 communicate online it gives you a lot of
32:51 signals about how that person
32:53 um is going to communicate in real life
32:55 so even the way that they would explain
32:58 what their roles are on LinkedIn for
33:00 example for me I mean I do this all the
33:02 time right but if I jump onto a LinkedIn
33:05 profile now and I'm making huge
33:07 assumptions here but like usually I can
33:10 get a really good feel for that person
33:12 before we even jump on a call and then
33:15 when we jump on about oh yeah like that
33:17 kind of makes sense right so just in
33:19 terms of like the communication style
33:20 how they write about what they do just
33:22 their their writing communication will
33:24 typically fold over to who they are as a
33:26 human being so
33:28 um what's the point Sorry I'm rambling
33:30 here but before the intro meeting I want
33:33 to really understand or try to gain as
33:36 much information about the type of
33:37 person I'm going to be speaking to not
33:39 about the topics and
33:42 so I guess in this case when you're
33:45 helping the candidate when you're
33:47 working with the client your candidate
33:49 you already did this homework right so
33:51 then you would tell the candidate hey
33:53 this is this is the person you're going
33:55 to speak to well so this is his uh this
33:58 is their personality
34:00 right so
34:01 like they prefer to be direct so they
34:03 have to
34:05 get to the point
34:07 yeah but let's say if somebody is not as
34:11 lucky to work with you
34:13 quite different process then this is
34:16 something they can do on their own right
34:18 take a look at the LinkedIn profile look
34:21 up the person in Google right maybe
34:23 there are some custom appearances maybe
34:26 there's uh I don't know talks maybe
34:28 there is something that can help to
34:30 understand that
34:31 Personality yeah I mean and don't get me
34:34 wrong this is not only exact science
34:35 right so it's not something that if you
34:38 follow this process you're going to get
34:39 it right 100 of the time because you
34:41 know some people just don't even post on
34:44 LinkedIn and they've got no online
34:45 community right so how can you work out
34:47 anything
34:48 at all right yeah exactly so like don't
34:51 get me wrong but you want to use these
34:52 as signals right so you don't want to
34:54 make any like absolutes before we jump
34:55 into that call you want to think I think
34:58 this is the type of person that he's uh
35:00 he or she is going to be like so if you
35:01 can kind of get to a stage where you
35:03 like right well this is the type of
35:04 person I'm going to be talking to this
35:06 is the type of character this is the
35:08 type of personality you can start to
35:09 adjust who or how you communicate to
35:12 that person right the second part
35:16 in terms of the intro meeting is you
35:17 need to really quickly assess the person
35:20 on the other end of the zoom call or
35:22 directly in front of you or on the phone
35:23 call within literally seconds of
35:26 speaking to that person because
35:29 people will tend to like communicate in
35:32 the way that they want to communicate
35:34 right so if you ever have a zoom call
35:35 with me I'm like hey how's it going and
35:39 that's how I communicate as a person so
35:41 I'm full of emojis and I'm like super
35:42 expressive and that kind of stuff right
35:44 when someone links with me on that the
35:46 calls are really like they they do well
35:48 right but when I have a call with
35:51 someone and I'm like hey they're like
35:53 hello I'm like I need to change the way
35:56 I am right now otherwise I'm going to be
35:58 jarring for this person and they're
35:59 going to think I'm a dick right so
36:02 there's a website that I'll send I'll
36:05 put it on the document but it's called
36:06 16 personalities
36:08 um it's essentially like a
36:10 psychoanalysis of different personality
36:13 types different communication Styles I
36:15 recommend it to anyone who's
36:16 interviewing to really try to understand
36:18 at least their own but have a good
36:20 understanding of what other people or
36:23 who other people can be and how they
36:25 like to communicate because the first
36:27 initial 10 seconds of conversation if
36:30 you don't pick up on that and then you
36:32 continue going down a road of jarring
36:35 completely different energy level be
36:38 that one way or another
36:40 the cool
36:42 again I don't want to talk in absolutes
36:44 but nine times out of ten people will be
36:46 on that opposite ends of the kind of
36:48 spectrum in terms of how they're trying
36:49 to communicate to each other so for me I
36:52 always try and work out the personality
36:54 character and the person before I do any
36:57 prep
36:58 um because the way that you communicate
37:00 to that person is going to be one of the
37:02 most important things you can do the
37:04 content is obviously important but if
37:06 you deliver it in a way that doesn't
37:08 land it's kind of irrelevant but also
37:11 it's important not just for interviews
37:13 right but pretty much everything else
37:15 still
37:19 yeah or like I don't know meeting
37:20 networking right yeah yeah exactly like
37:24 you there's probably been times in
37:28 everyone's life where they've had a
37:29 conversation with someone and they just
37:31 instantly click they're just like we get
37:34 each other we just we're on the same
37:36 wavelength right this is probably we've
37:38 got the same personality
37:40 yeah it's the same communication
37:43 you're singing from the same hymn she
37:45 and you're communicating in a way that
37:47 the other person likes to communicate
37:49 and understands and it's natural but in
37:52 interviews obviously don't have the
37:54 privilege of choosing who interviews you
37:57 right so it's not like they're one of
37:59 your friends or whatever so you have to
38:01 deal with the person in front of you and
38:02 I think that understanding the
38:04 personality type of the person that
38:06 you're talking to doing your research
38:08 about that individual will give you a
38:11 good at least a good start right
38:14 um I took a look at the time and
38:16 realized that the topic for this uh
38:18 interview is technical or like technical
38:21 right yeah I love the topic like this
38:24 this is really interesting like it's 16
38:25 personalities of like you know oh you're
38:28 assessment
38:30 um anything else you want to mention on
38:32 the intro meeting before we move on to
38:35 definitely yeah there's one more thing
38:37 so typically you'll have standardized
38:40 questions tell me a bit about you what's
38:42 your background tell me about some
38:44 projects that you've worked on what
38:45 you're looking for or the normal kind of
38:48 everyday recruitment stuff right one
38:50 more final thing on the intro call is
38:52 well there's a lot more in the document
38:54 but one more for now
38:57 um I would highly recommend
38:59 standardizing your answers to that and
39:01 practicing them so they are really
39:04 fluent and you can articulate who you
39:07 are what you do while you're looking
39:08 projects you've worked on examples of
39:10 things that you've done in a just just
39:12 on demand so if someone says Alexi
39:15 says Alexa tell me about a project
39:18 you've worked on that you're proud of
39:19 cool here it is would be like in the
39:22 elevator pitch for pretty much
39:23 everything right like yeah tell you
39:26 about yourself like I don't know a bunch
39:28 of projects you worked on so you should
39:30 have a story prepared for that like ties
39:33 to the point where and if they ask for
39:35 the company
39:36 yeah so like the star methodology if no
39:39 one's ever heard of that it's situation
39:41 task action result
39:43 um it's a good thing to kind of um work
39:45 towards but if you practice enough you
39:48 can it can sometimes feel a bit rigid if
39:50 you like hey like this is the situation
39:52 this is the task this was my action it
39:55 that's going to come across a bit a bit
39:57 manufactured but if you can stick to
39:59 that and wrap it into
40:02 um the normal way that you communicate
40:04 so you've done it so many times it just
40:06 becomes second nature
40:07 it's a good kind of framework to work so
40:10 I guess but yeah standardized questions
40:12 you know pretty much what they're going
40:14 to talk to you about and what they're
40:15 going to ask you it's going to be a get
40:16 to know there's going to be some
40:17 standard questions get some good
40:19 examples work on them have them so
40:22 they're on demand ready to go and you
40:24 come across really articulate because I
40:25 think
40:26 you don't want to get caught out on hey
40:29 man tell me about you and it's
40:31 I mean they might like if they don't
40:34 practice uh like it would say last time
40:36 I had interview was four years ago
40:39 I might be oh and then start like the
40:42 story from my childhood
40:44 yeah yeah
40:48 exactly man
40:50 um but yes the internet for me is like
40:52 quite
40:53 um that's one thing obviously this is
40:55 about technical interviewing right so
40:57 um
40:59 the key okay
41:01 I noticed that I cannot access slider so
41:05 if any of you are asking questions
41:08 slider just doesn't load so please put
41:11 them in the live chat and I will be able
41:12 to see them from the live chat I don't
41:14 know what happened to slider but I
41:16 imagine that there are 30 43 people on
41:20 this stream right now and
41:23 yeah probably a couple of questions I
41:24 unfortunately cannot exist down so
41:26 please put them in the live chat and
41:28 yeah we can maybe move on to the
41:30 technical part
41:32 so
41:33 where should we start
41:35 so
41:36 yeah like what is it like what what is
41:39 the what do we usually have in the
41:41 technical part like it's like recording
41:43 hearing questions uh what else
41:47 yeah so
41:49 I think probably there's mainly three
41:53 maybe four key things in the technical
41:55 thing
41:57 um number one binary questions what's
42:00 the answer to this what is the correct
42:02 answer to this thing
42:04 um number two
42:06 what would you do or what if situations
42:09 so what happens if this happens how
42:12 would you deal with that
42:14 um example based questions so tell me
42:17 about the time that you did this
42:19 and then lastly coding challenges coding
42:24 like tasks and stuff like that right
42:27 um
42:28 so yeah that's typically what's in the
42:30 technical interview but um I mean again
42:32 this is why we need to be fairly generic
42:34 here is that most companies or all
42:36 companies are quite different from how
42:39 they run their interviews
42:41 um so this isn't like this isn't the
42:43 blueprint of how it works but generally
42:46 there'll be some kind of like technical
42:48 session in the middle how companies
42:50 frame that is different from business to
42:52 business
42:54 what a typical questions that ECF of
42:57 course companies are different if you
42:59 interview with other companies you will
43:00 look at probably 100 different
43:02 questions but well some of these
43:05 questions will be probably similar like
43:06 in your data scientists you will see
43:09 something that come up comes up
43:12 right so do you know what what kind of
43:15 questions there are usually
43:19 kind of theory coding yeah I'm with
43:22 geometry um it's probably it's very
43:24 closely aligned to like those four types
43:27 of things right so again all companies
43:30 and this is part of the prep
43:32 um all companies will have different
43:34 expectations and what they're going to
43:35 speak to you about so
43:37 for me I would never prepare for
43:39 specific questions I would practice
43:41 questions in case they come up but when
43:44 it comes to preparation for technical
43:46 interviews you what we need to do is
43:50 really under or try to understand the
43:52 expectations of the individual customers
43:55 that we're trying to work with right or
43:57 the individual companies that we're
43:58 trying to join so the questions I mean I
44:02 could tell you something but they're not
44:03 going to be relevant for everyone else
44:04 right but what is relevant is
44:08 um
44:09 setting the expectations or under trying
44:11 to understand the expectations of the
44:13 clients that you're interviewing with so
44:15 again if you had someone on the inside
44:17 or a HR Talent person that you're
44:19 working with or a recruiter when you get
44:21 to a technical interview the first thing
44:24 that you should be asking is what are
44:25 the expectations of this interview you
44:27 should never ever in my opinion go into
44:30 an interview and say it's a technical
44:33 interview and that's all you know that
44:35 is blasphemy here my word
44:38 um
44:39 every single time you go into any
44:41 interview you should really understand
44:42 at least from an agenda perspective
44:46 the context of what you're going into
44:48 and speaking about right because you
44:50 need something to base your prep offers
44:54 um so yeah number one I'd always do this
44:56 before so let's say
44:59 and working with you so I am over like I
45:03 passed this introduction stage and now
45:05 you set
45:07 an interview a technical interview with
45:10 oh like somebody I don't know senior
45:12 data scientist
45:14 so what I do do I ask you or do I ask
45:16 that person like what are your
45:18 expectations in email before the
45:20 interview so I know what to expect
45:22 yeah this is what you're saying yeah so
45:25 let's say you got through the the intro
45:28 stage and that went really well look I'm
45:30 really Keen to continue
45:32 um what's the next stage and what are
45:33 the expectations so if we're in that
45:35 technical stage I should be able to give
45:37 you a very strong or at least some
45:40 pointers in terms of what they're going
45:41 to be looking for within that technical
45:43 stage right and that's the kind of
45:45 Baseline for your preparation what we
45:47 don't want to do is go really broad
45:49 really generic and kind of not really
45:51 know what goal we're shooting at and yes
45:54 there are some really good sites out
45:56 there where you can go and practice like
45:57 coding questions and Link code and
46:00 hackarack and code forces and stuff like
46:02 that but generally I think when we are
46:05 prepping for
46:06 an organization we want to keep it as
46:09 focused towards our business as we
46:10 possibly can which leans back on to
46:13 I would only recommend that you do this
46:15 if this is like the role that you
46:17 actually want and this is the company
46:18 that you actually want because it takes
46:20 time and you need to look at the
46:22 organizations and think well firstly you
46:24 want to ask the question because that's
46:27 going to give you the good Baseline to
46:28 work on but then secondly you want to
46:31 start looking at the individual job
46:33 specs and roles that you're applying for
46:35 in interviewing for and start to work
46:37 out
46:39 um
46:40 the levels of
46:43 um
46:44 essential the secondary the ideal skills
46:49 because that's going to give you the
46:51 prep and that's going to give you the
46:52 direction of how much time you put on
46:54 the prep because for me I'd much rather
46:57 the candidates that I work with spend a
47:00 ton of time focused on really getting up
47:03 to scratch on the core Essentials of the
47:05 role spending 20 of their res like their
47:09 prep time on like secondary skills and
47:12 then if we've got any time left over
47:13 throughout that prep stage
47:16 work out what else is the like ideal
47:19 other things that might be really
47:21 beneficial to the role but aren't
47:22 essential or secondary
47:24 um so the questions for me are they're
47:26 important because with the customers I
47:28 work with now I do know some of the
47:30 specific questions that they would ask
47:32 um but
47:34 I don't typically I don't share them
47:36 with candidates because then it will
47:37 become unfair like if I said this is
47:39 exactly what they're going to ask you
47:40 then that's not fair right but um yeah
47:44 so I'll give people pointers about the
47:47 areas of what's going to get spoken
47:49 about
47:50 um and then I'll set the expectations
47:52 for how much they should know
47:55 or how much they should be able to
47:58 articulate themselves within those
47:59 particular things right do you mean like
48:02 how deep in theory should go or like you
48:04 can just uh cover the basic concepts
48:07 like we don't need to go to the things
48:09 like that right yeah official so I
48:12 always think it's like if you look if
48:14 you imagine like three Circles of like
48:16 depth so the first point is you know
48:19 um
48:20 uh fairly basic
48:23 um everyone should understand points
48:25 about this then I would never skip over
48:29 those points because candidates
48:30 sometimes when you think that you know
48:32 if you've not been asked to articulate
48:34 it for a while
48:36 um the fundamentals are always really
48:37 important right so I never say skip over
48:41 um the kind of basic questions and the
48:43 basic knowledge because I think that if
48:45 you get asked the question that's fairly
48:47 simple and something that you probably
48:48 do on a day-to-day basis but you you
48:50 like you don't know how to articulate
48:52 that in a really fluent way
48:55 how they read that is do you actually
48:56 know that's correct yeah exactly it
48:59 doesn't answer but it's like um you will
49:01 start rambling and then you don't beat
49:03 answered them right yeah so like um to
49:06 give you to give you an example one of
49:08 the questions that catches like loads of
49:10 candidates out and one of the clients
49:11 that I work with is what do generators
49:14 and decorators do
49:16 um
49:18 yeah and tons of people use them and
49:21 they know them but to articulate what
49:24 they do is some people get really caught
49:26 up on that and then they look at that
49:28 Candlelight and think didn't really know
49:30 it
49:30 like didn't really explain himself very
49:32 well or herself very well on that
49:34 particular point and then it's just a
49:36 little it's not obviously a red flag but
49:37 it's a it's a cross next to your name in
49:39 terms of one of the particular things
49:41 right so I always say definitely think
49:43 about the fundamentals you don't get
49:45 caught up on anything that you know that
49:46 you could easily work with but
49:49 just for some reason interview nerves
49:52 being pressured in an interview whatever
49:53 you just you [ __ ] that part up right
49:56 anyway so first circle like essential
49:59 things that are real high priority in
50:01 the fundamentals secondary how do we
50:03 level that up now like what's the more
50:05 difficult versions of this and if I was
50:08 interviewing you
50:09 what would what would my question be
50:11 that's going to be a follow-up question
50:13 to what I've just answered like how do
50:16 we make that question I've just answered
50:19 correctly 10 times harder like what's
50:21 the what's the natural follow-up stage
50:23 there that's what they'd be usually like
50:25 I don't have at least questions they ask
50:26 I just uh yeah tell me about the project
50:29 you worked on and then the person tells
50:31 about the project and they say okay I
50:33 use this model like I don't know random
50:35 course I'm gonna tell me about around
50:36 the poor sports yeah man
50:39 um and then I like to start digging like
50:41 every time you say something I try to
50:44 you know follow up and then yeah exactly
50:48 I guess some people have different
50:49 individuals that's right some people
50:50 just get those questions and then maybe
50:52 don't dig deeper but want to check your
50:56 in like the breadth of your knowledge
50:59 right yeah but then if that is the case
51:01 we should know that right if so if
51:06 if someone's going in for like a breadth
51:09 interview where they want to see how
51:11 much you know in cloud and X and Y and Z
51:14 and all of these areas then that's what
51:16 we should be prepping for but we can't
51:18 do that if we don't know the
51:20 expectations from the business or from
51:23 the recruiter or from the internal
51:25 Talent person right so for me I always
51:27 think that all businesses should not
51:29 give people the answers and not give
51:31 people like so much information that
51:33 they can kind of
51:35 they come up for the into process easier
51:37 because it does need to be in my opinion
51:39 it needs to be tough and we need to work
51:40 out if people can actually do it and
51:41 they can think from themselves and all
51:43 of that sort of stuff but
51:45 you can't set people up to phone like
51:48 you can't be like Turn Up For a
51:49 technical interview and we'll see how
51:50 you go like that for me is [ __ ] so I
51:53 think we definitely need to at least
51:55 have context about what's going to get
51:56 spoken about
51:58 and then you can prep for it right but
51:59 then it still follows the same principle
52:01 in my eyes like what's the follow-up
52:03 question to this particular thing like
52:06 what kind of flowchart would I ask
52:07 candidates or would I ask myself if I
52:10 was interviewing that will make this
52:11 difficult and then that gives you a lot
52:13 more of a kind of like free throw at
52:15 free flowing prep rather than being like
52:18 I think they're going to talk about this
52:19 I think they're going to talk about this
52:20 realistically
52:22 if we're talking about this particular
52:24 subject most companies interview in the
52:26 same sort of ways you do so let's talk
52:28 about this particular question let's see
52:30 how they answer it and then let's stem
52:32 from that particular answer
52:35 um so if I was prepping for like if I
52:37 was a machine learning engineer a data
52:38 scientist this is how I would I'd be
52:40 like right let's start on something that
52:42 we definitely know is going to get
52:43 spoken about outside of that how do we
52:46 work around that to build more of a
52:49 um breadth but also depth within that
52:52 particular thing right
52:54 um
52:55 I'm rambling now but
52:58 um I'm just thinking how do I stop you
53:03 that was fine I'm joking so I see that
53:05 we have three questions say maybe it's
53:07 time we actually covered them so the
53:09 first question is what do you think of
53:10 companies that mainly ask very
53:12 theoretical questions as if data
53:15 scientists should all know mathematical
53:17 and statistical for laws
53:22 I think it's if it's relevant for that
53:24 business
53:25 then it's valid
53:27 but I think
53:30 how often is it relevant sometimes I
53:32 feel like people don't know what to ask
53:34 for the internet and just just Google a
53:36 list of questions and this list is
53:38 theoretical and just fire these
53:40 questions
53:40 yeah so if it's completely abstract
53:43 these are our interview questions for no
53:45 other reason apart from these are kind
53:47 of the right things that you would ask
53:48 in an interview for a data scientist
53:50 then no that's [ __ ] like all of the
53:53 interviews in my opinion should work
53:57 backwards from the job responsibilities
53:59 and what they're going to do on a
54:00 day-to-day basis so if that's something
54:02 that they're never going to touch or
54:04 don't need to know then why why ask it
54:07 like what's the point what's your
54:09 schedule yes at University
54:16 yeah I mean I've I've heard that before
54:19 from clients I work with
54:21 um but
54:23 how much impact does that have on a
54:26 candidate's ability to do the job right
54:28 now if they can recall something that
54:30 they left like learn six seven eight
54:32 nine years ago of a very like specific
54:37 like the thing what impact is that going
54:40 to have on if they can do that right now
54:42 I guess the
54:44 the flip side to that is no I don't even
54:47 miss Cliffside actually
54:49 um I think they're [ __ ]
54:50 [Music]
54:53 I'm checking the second position
54:56 so how do you keep going with an
54:58 interview if you've locked in between
55:00 and feel uncomfortable
55:02 um what does what mean it's like when
55:04 you felt like if they've just if they
55:06 bonded
55:08 um all depends to like if you're kind of
55:10 failed right if you didn't do that yeah
55:13 um now it's uh 18 plus podcast
55:16 sorry man
55:20 um so I guess it depends sorry I know
55:23 it's already awful answer but
55:25 um I I guess it depends on
55:29 how you've Bond and like
55:32 how that feels in the scenario like it
55:36 would be good if they can be a little
55:37 bit more of a specific but and it
55:39 depends if you really want that job so
55:41 if I've bombed and I've bonded an
55:43 interview before like absolutely and
55:47 um but I really wanted to work there so
55:49 my it didn't it didn't work out in the
55:51 end but I've got nothing to lose at this
55:53 stage right so if you've bond in an
55:55 interview and you think I can do better
55:56 than that that was a really bad day for
55:58 me I'd tell them I would go back and
56:01 I've had multiple people that I've
56:03 worked with who have Bond interviews and
56:06 I've said look take four weeks we're
56:08 gonna prep on these particular things
56:10 that you absolutely bombed on and then
56:11 we're going to retake that interview
56:13 with Declan
56:15 um and people have got jobs from that
56:17 um
56:18 something
56:26 yeah when I failed something then I just
56:28 okay I should have to answer it this way
56:30 and then I do some research and I was
56:32 like okay like this is
56:33 this is what the answer should be right
56:35 and then I just don't do anything else
56:37 just next time this question comes up
56:39 maybe I answered better but that's
56:41 that's it but what you say is instead of
56:44 you know just uh you know working
56:46 through this and think you know better
56:48 answer you reach out to the company and
56:50 say look I had a bad day this is uh like
56:54 I need a bit of uh thinking and I want
56:56 to retake it and some companies actually
56:59 agree to
57:00 the interview for for example and then
57:04 that and then they take those people in
57:06 the end yeah so there's three examples
57:08 I've got in my mind right now of people
57:10 that have done that over the past like
57:12 year with me
57:13 um but anyway so if you if you've bombed
57:16 an interview this all depends on if you
57:19 really want it if you really want it
57:20 then what have you got to lose right you
57:22 should definitely go for it but
57:25 if you bumped an interview and you think
57:27 oh this is
57:28 it's not for me anyway I mean I would
57:30 just wrap that interview up really
57:31 quickly and then just get out there but
57:33 if you think I bombed that and I want it
57:36 exactly how you said I would message the
57:39 person that's just interviewed me
57:41 another like Alexa I've actually bombed
57:44 that interview and that was awful
57:46 um I can 100 do better than that will
57:48 you just do me a favor and give me three
57:49 to four four weeks let me come back and
57:51 retake that
57:53 can we do that most people would say
57:56 yeah
57:57 um just wondering what would I do what
57:59 if I get if I receive the requests like
58:01 that
58:02 against what uh our recruiter would tell
58:04 me to do I never received the request
58:06 like that
58:11 listening to this interview right now
58:13 and then we'll have an interview with me
58:15 and hopefully you don't want it but in
58:18 case it happens
58:19 but I risk that sometimes sorry just one
58:23 more thing on that so the risk there is
58:25 that you do that and then you bomb again
58:28 oh yeah oops
58:30 um I've had that and it is heartbreaking
58:32 to be like sorry man you still wasn't
58:35 good enough
58:37 um that's the risk that you take but if
58:40 you really want the thing that you're
58:41 going after I mean I would take that
58:43 risk every day
58:46 questions from Alvin is the key to apply
58:49 to different roles in the same company
58:50 within a short amount of time
58:53 if it's relevant
58:55 um
58:57 yeah but I wouldn't like pepper Garner
58:59 company and apply for everything like so
59:01 I
59:03 I mean there were some people that would
59:05 look at that and think oh that's a bad
59:06 sign I don't really see it as a bad sign
59:10 um as long as I just think it's a bit
59:12 lazy
59:13 um to be like apply all click click a
59:16 click
59:17 um because I've seen people that have
59:18 applied for like work student jobs and
59:20 then Senior and principal Engineers I'm
59:22 like that's you're not looking at what
59:25 you're doing right so
59:27 um I don't think it's a bad thing but
59:28 just make sure it's super relevant and
59:30 just keep it focused towards what you
59:31 actually want to do so
59:33 um but I think we spoke about this last
59:35 time I think the best thing you can do
59:36 is actually just reach out to the right
59:37 people and speak to them directly
59:39 otherwise you just get put into a black
59:40 hole of 10 000 other applications and
59:43 you probably never contacted
59:45 um for me the standing out part is about
59:48 being different and doing something
59:49 differently so
59:51 I would personally just reach out to the
59:54 people and say this is what I want to do
59:55 and this is where the impact I can have
59:57 with you guys this is the impact I can
59:59 have with you guys these are the roles
1:00:01 I'm thinking about what what should I
1:00:02 apply for and where should I go
1:00:04 yeah I can add to that but I also see
1:00:08 nothing wrong so we and staff for
1:00:11 positions that look similar but they're
1:00:13 from different teams
1:00:16 and then yeah talk to the recruiter on
1:00:19 the first interview say foreign
1:00:23 and two we should be wrapping up so the
1:00:26 last thing I want to ask you if you have
1:00:28 any book or other resource
1:00:30 recommendations that you can give to
1:00:32 listeners
1:00:34 yeah
1:00:35 um so on this document I mean I'll tell
1:00:38 them now
1:00:40 um link code hacker rank code forces
1:00:42 algor monster
1:00:44 um educative I don't know if you've ever
1:00:45 heard of them before they're really all
1:00:47 of that if you want to practice just
1:00:49 questions and interview questions and
1:00:51 Engineering questions and science
1:00:53 questions they're really really good
1:00:56 um they're really I know there's a lot
1:00:58 of controversy about lead code questions
1:01:00 and all of this sort of stuff but
1:01:02 companies run interviews like that so if
1:01:05 you want to practice
1:01:06 they're really good places to start
1:01:08 um but then equally as I say this
1:01:10 document that I'm putting together about
1:01:12 interview prep I'm really sorry we
1:01:13 didn't get to really dive into like a
1:01:15 lot of the topics today but yeah
1:01:19 um this document I'm gonna work on it
1:01:21 and I'm going to expand on it so if
1:01:23 anyone wants it reach out to me on
1:01:25 LinkedIn and give me a couple of days to
1:01:27 make it look like it's not been written
1:01:29 by five-year-old and then I'll happily
1:01:31 share that with everyone okay I have
1:01:33 your reports right
