0:49 okay this week we'll talk about the
0:51 secret source of data science management
0:53 if we have special guest today sure sure
0:56 is a data science group manager at
0:57 Intuit India in the United States
1:01 she is working on developing machine
1:02 learning and deep learning models for
1:04 document intelligence for products like
1:06 troop attacks and QuickBooks uh welcome
1:10 sir
1:12 thank you Alex it's great to be here
1:14 should I call you Alex or Alexa Alex
1:17 Alexi well some people do call me Alex
1:20 and I'm used to that but uh my mom would
1:22 never call me Alex
1:29 sorry about
1:30 technical issues yeah we always have
1:33 these technical issues
1:35 um anyways so I think we should start
1:38 right but before we start before we go
1:40 into our main topic of the secret source
1:42 of data science management let's start
1:44 with your background can you tell us
1:46 about your career Journey so far
1:50 yeah sure so
1:52 um I uh studied electrical engineering I
1:57 did my bachelor in maths Masters in that
1:59 topic in Bengal University in the native
2:02 of Israel
2:03 and
2:05 um since then I worked in two startups
2:08 as a data scientists algorithm developer
2:11 and five and a half years ago I moved
2:15 into into it and then I took a
2:18 leadership role
2:20 um and then to introduce Israel for five
2:23 years leading and growing the team
2:25 developing AI solutions for security
2:27 risk and fraud and smart products
2:31 and about seven months ago I relocated
2:33 to the Bay Area which we don't have
2:36 electricity in large part of at the
2:38 moment
2:39 and to take on a new leadership position
2:43 leading a team that is focused around
2:45 document intelligence
2:48 basically the mission of my current team
2:51 is to use a computer vision and NLP
2:55 methods to extract and classify
2:57 information from any Financial document
2:59 that is uploaded to a system in order to
3:03 simplify a tax submission and their
3:06 small business management for our
3:08 customers
3:09 and save them time basically to take the
3:13 heavy lifting of the
3:15 all of their financial hard work they
3:19 have in their life
3:21 I'm just curious did you happen to serve
3:25 the Army in Israel because we had
3:27 another guest from Israel uh maybe more
3:30 than a year ago and I think she was a
3:31 some sort of pilot so that is uh that
3:34 was pretty interesting so did you need
3:36 to do anything like that did you need to
3:37 Pilot anything
3:39 foreign
3:41 yeah I actually served for three years
3:44 in the Army I was a pilot instructor
3:46 it's interesting what you said but I was
3:48 a pilot instructor in a flight simulator
3:52 uh so that's an interesting thing since
3:55 yeah I trained pilot for helicopters for
3:59 a Blackhawks and a stripper stallion
4:03 was it useful for your career afterwards
4:08 um well definitely I've learned so much
4:11 from the Israeli Air Force the
4:16 debris culture really helps me in really
4:21 developing a growth mindset and also you
4:25 know being a pilot trainer really helps
4:27 you be a good leader and a good Mentor
4:30 for your team
4:33 which is I guess quite related to the
4:36 topic today right
4:39 so what is this deep brief culture
4:41 definitely
4:44 so basically how it works every time a
4:48 pilot goes onto a flight in the sky or
4:52 in this flight simulator they look at
4:55 their lessons learned from previous
4:57 slides in the simulator or in or on air
5:02 on the helicopter and they take three
5:05 things they want to focus in in this
5:07 slide and after they get off the flight
5:10 they debrief retrospect on what happened
5:14 in that flight and what are the three
5:16 things they want to work on for the next
5:19 time
5:20 um so that's something I've really taken
5:22 to my life because this is really the
5:25 best way to to get better to just keep
5:28 on learning from experience keep on
5:29 marking the areas where you want to
5:32 focus at
5:35 yeah I just want to make sure I
5:37 understood it correctly so before the
5:39 flight or before doing something you
5:41 think of what are the three things I
5:43 want to focus on in this flight project
5:46 whatever right so you think about these
5:49 things in advance then you try to focus
5:51 on and then after the flight or after
5:53 the project after the thing
5:55 you do it retrospective and you think
5:57 okay what are the three things I want to
6:00 improve based on the experience I just
6:02 had
6:03 is it correct correct summary
6:06 yes yes it's a correct summary
6:09 um and the three things that you you
6:10 focus at are usually things that you
6:13 noticed in the past that you should do
6:15 better at
6:17 mm-hmm
6:18 so it could be like better uh navigating
6:22 the the helicopter right
6:25 yeah it could be better navigating if
6:27 it's specifically the simulator so we
6:30 are working on how they handle
6:32 emergencies on air for example if the
6:35 tail water is now malfunctioning and the
6:38 helicopters start spinning around so how
6:41 fast did they reduce the collective the
6:43 power and how fast did they react with
6:46 the pedals
6:47 um so and also things about teamwork you
6:51 know how much did they listen to their
6:52 co-pilot so
6:55 many things like that I think my
6:57 computer is back so up time to connect
7:01 to zoom let's see let's try
7:05 but if the computer is back probably
7:09 internet should also work doesn't mean
7:11 it will that's it
7:14 yeah I'm taking it from my uh my phone
7:17 yeah can you see me
7:19 well I see that you're trying to get uh
7:26 oops oops
7:31 looks like you're in hi hi nice to see
7:36 your face it's uh and the sound quality
7:38 is better now
7:40 over the phone it was a bit
7:42 I'm sorry about that I also have a kid
7:45 back in the house because we don't have
7:46 school today because the school doesn't
7:48 have electricity dude yeah so
7:52 funny I see
7:55 a better infrastructure in the Silicon
7:58 Valley right than in Israel why then
8:01 then you know anywhere where
8:04 because like all the IIT companies are
8:07 there and they need electricity right
8:09 yeah
8:11 okay well maybe they have like backup
8:14 generators or whatever because Google I
8:16 think YouTube still works uh although
8:19 probably the servers are not in the Bay
8:22 Area right
8:23 for YouTube
8:26 it's too expensive Road anyways um so we
8:30 stopped at uh
8:33 um the brief summary right the brief
8:35 culture and what I wanted to ask you
8:38 next is what do you actually do as a
8:40 group manager what are your
8:42 responsibilities
8:44 so
8:45 um I am a manager of three teams so
8:50 basically I have team leads that lead
8:52 those teams I also manage a a couple of
8:56 ICS and
8:59 it's a the group manager role is
9:03 basically
9:04 um to define the strategy for the whole
9:07 group to plan ahead you know look one
9:10 year three years ahead see you know what
9:13 is the vision where we want to get
9:16 um find the right things we want to
9:18 focus at as a group uh what is the right
9:21 direction
9:23 from research what are the things we
9:27 what are the metrics we would want to
9:30 look at what what does success look like
9:32 for our team
9:34 um and of course also make sure we're
9:37 building a high performing group
9:40 um
9:41 by you know a mentoring the managers as
9:46 well as a reviewing you know what the
9:49 team is doing and what we are delivering
9:52 setting the standards working with the
9:56 leadership team uh to to make sure we
10:00 are
10:01 um delivering the highest standards yeah
10:04 okay that's quite a few things so you're
10:07 managing the managers and you mentioned
10:10 ICS I guess these are people on the
10:13 staff or principle level right
10:15 um so you are a manager of managers then
10:18 you also take care of the strategy for
10:19 the entire group when it comes to data I
10:21 guess like what exactly you want to
10:23 achieve in the next couple of years
10:26 um so you need to to know a lot about
10:28 management right to manage managers
10:32 um so what does it mean to be a
10:34 successful data science manager
10:37 so
10:38 um I I as you know I gave a talk about
10:41 that about
10:44 exactly so that's actually like the
10:46 story is uh it was Pi data Berlin right
10:49 and I think I saw your talk there and
10:51 they reached out and it's been one year
10:53 since then and we finally managed to uh
10:57 be on the same call and discuss that but
11:00 yeah sorry for interrupting you
11:03 yeah
11:04 um so I think that
11:07 um when you say what is success you
11:10 always need to have a measurement for
11:12 that so I think the two things I focus
11:15 at uh is
11:17 um
11:18 how much we are able to deliver impact
11:21 for the business so this is one aspect
11:25 of success and the other
11:29 aspect is the growth and engagement of
11:33 the team members
11:35 so these are the the two things I I
11:38 measure Myself by
11:40 and also growth of the business and
11:42 growth of the people right so yeah two
11:44 aspects business and people
11:46 and what what kind of metrics are there
11:49 I guess for business it could be like a
11:51 usual business metrics that we look at
11:55 uh like for the product right so because
11:57 we use data science to improve the
11:59 product
12:00 um but what about the second aspect of
12:02 people so what kind of metrics do you
12:04 look and at their
12:06 so
12:07 um luckily because we are at a big
12:10 company we have what's called a pause
12:12 survey uh basically that's a survey
12:15 that's done every six months
12:18 um and that's you know that's not
12:20 everything but that's actually measures
12:23 at least one aspect of that it measures
12:26 for example the engagement of the team
12:29 by asking different questions all the
12:32 team members and so that's that's one
12:36 very easy measurement you can look at it
12:38 also had other questions so you can also
12:41 there are all there's also something's
12:44 called manager score which also
12:47 um
12:48 uh measures different aspects of
12:51 management like giving recognition
12:53 giving guidance for the team
12:57 um providing feedback all of those
13:01 things are measured and combine this
13:04 what we call manager score
13:07 so you ask
13:10 the people who this managers manage
13:13 what do they do they think about their
13:16 managers right and then they give some
13:17 feedback like do they feel that the
13:20 receive enough guidance they receive
13:22 enough feedback they have all the
13:23 resources they need to be successful at
13:25 their job right and then I guess this is
13:27 anonymized right you don't yeah so this
13:31 survey it's it it's just a survey it's
13:33 true this app this company called glint
13:37 that they do it
13:39 um and it's all anonymized and we just
13:41 get the aggregated scores with our teams
13:45 the team can also provide comments but
13:48 um I don't have access to the comments
13:50 you need to have a I think like at least
13:54 50 people to see all the comments so
13:57 like you know the VP or director would
13:59 have that
14:01 access to all the comments and then they
14:03 can direct me to comments they think may
14:05 be relevant to my team
14:07 so in this case
14:10 to call a data science manager
14:12 successful we look at two things
14:15 business metrics if the team is uh I
14:19 don't know delivered on their okrs or
14:21 whatever framework they use for setting
14:23 goals if they deliver on the goals and
14:26 they have impact they show impact on
14:28 business metrics and second please how
14:30 difficult the management score the
14:32 manager score right
14:34 yeah so those teachings are good then we
14:37 can call the manager successful well
14:40 it's it's not just that and it's not
14:42 just the manager's car it's also the
14:44 engagement score because as I said one
14:46 of the one of the roles of the manager
14:48 is to make sure the team is engaged so
14:50 it's not just directly through the
14:52 manager's core but you know this is not
14:54 the only way I would measure my managers
14:58 I would also look
15:00 um you know at the feedback I just get
15:02 from their team I am doing skip levels
15:05 with their team
15:07 um so that there are multiple aspects
15:10 this is just a part of it
15:12 [Music]
15:13 yeah
15:15 okay and in that talk that you mentioned
15:19 the biodata talk you talked about the
15:22 three pillars of data science management
15:23 do you remember what these pillars are
15:26 or this is what we already talked about
15:28 just now
15:29 yeah yeah so we have managing app
15:32 managing
15:33 um across and managing below and
15:36 actually I want to add something more we
15:39 have the Intuit leadership Playbook
15:40 which I think it's also really helpful
15:42 so they also Define kind of three
15:45 pillars it's not exactly
15:47 um
15:48 parallel but it's also an interesting
15:50 way to look at it one is lead with a
15:53 Clear Vision the second is a drive
15:56 winning results and the third one is
15:59 build a high performance culture a high
16:03 performance team high performance
16:04 culture so I think these are all kind of
16:08 related to the things we talked about
16:10 just a different way to explain it yeah
16:12 but when you talk about managing up
16:15 across and below I think this is more
16:17 about how do you achieve all of those
16:21 things we just mentioned you know living
16:23 with a clear and driving with the
16:25 results so this is more of the of the
16:28 practice
16:30 so what is managing up what does it mean
16:32 we're managing up
16:35 um is how you work with your leadership
16:39 team with your manager with the manager
16:42 of your manager to kind of give them an
16:45 understanding of what is your vision of
16:48 your team uh share with them the success
16:51 of your team the requirements for your
16:55 team to be successful maybe you need
16:58 their help maybe you need more resources
17:01 um it's a lot about
17:04 educating them about the accomplishments
17:07 of your team because if you don't share
17:11 with them the successes of your team how
17:13 would they know right this is the role
17:15 of the manager and if they won't know
17:18 what would be their motivation to invest
17:20 further in this team
17:23 um so this is managing what happens if
17:27 we don't manage app what happens if we
17:30 don't manage to I don't know tell how
17:33 good our team is well what can happen
17:36 what can go wrong
17:38 yeah it's like it's like the that's
17:40 saying you know if a tree falls in the
17:42 forest and no one hears it you know did
17:44 it fall even
17:46 um I think it's kind of it's kind of
17:48 similar to that
17:49 um because
17:51 if you don't get the the backup from
17:54 your leadership so how would you be able
17:56 to grow and get more impact and improve
18:00 um and also it's also true for one's
18:03 career and I also encourage my employees
18:06 to do that for themselves and I try to
18:08 do that for myself try to list your own
18:12 accomplishments and share it with your
18:14 manager because your manager they don't
18:16 see everything you do and so to be
18:20 recognized you need to help your manager
18:23 recognize you
18:25 I think I heard about the concept called
18:27 the brag document where you like brag
18:31 about all your accomplishments uh you
18:34 say okay like in this quarter I did this
18:37 this and this and then you have this
18:38 document and then you can share this
18:40 document with your manager and then the
18:42 manager will realize how
18:46 valuable you are right maybe they don't
18:49 know all the details about all the work
18:51 you do but with this black document you
18:53 help them know about that right
18:56 and so this in this instance we talk
18:58 about managing up from me as individual
19:01 contributor to my manager right but then
19:03 it also can work up even more like from
19:07 the manager level to the group manager
19:08 level or head of data science or
19:10 whatever like to the manager of managers
19:12 and this is what you're talking about
19:14 right what do you mean management
19:15 managing hub
19:17 yeah yeah and also fun but
19:22 work uh with leadership that's also very
19:26 important
19:28 so leadership would understand you know
19:30 the impact and also the complexities of
19:33 the things we we deliver
19:37 what kind of tools can we use for that
19:39 cool what can we do for that
19:42 so
19:44 um we have regular a we call it like
19:47 side visits OR tech reviews with the
19:50 Opera leadership so we need to make sure
19:52 that our team gets a slot in this and
19:56 myself you know as a group manager so
19:59 I'm not a front line manager so I also
20:02 do those tech reviews with with my team
20:04 members to get to know what they're
20:06 working on and to see if I have some
20:09 directions to them
20:12 um to to you know get an opportunity to
20:14 ask them some questions and
20:17 and
20:19 so at that is like a meeting where we
20:23 have the the management and the actual
20:27 people who do the work together in the
20:29 same room or visual room where uh
20:33 the the employees talk about the
20:37 accomplishments right what they did so
20:39 far how successfully the projects are
20:42 and then the management
20:44 well kind of learns about all the
20:46 complexities and all the things
20:48 yeah yeah it's it's mainly focused
20:50 around projects so when we get a project
20:53 at a certain Milestone I ask you know
20:56 the managers should we do a tech reviews
20:57 on this I would like to learn about this
21:00 this and this and then we kind of set
21:02 the tech review they prepare something
21:04 and present and then we have a
21:06 discussion
21:08 so like in practice it could be just a
21:11 zoom meeting or like depending on the
21:14 setup of the team the zoom meeting or
21:16 just the meeting right
21:17 yeah yeah and we have a regular regular
21:20 schedule for that once a week we have a
21:23 tech review or a design review
21:25 do you do anything else apart from these
21:28 meetings I don't know like maybe some
21:30 sort of uh email with somebody of all
21:32 the accomplishments or not really
21:37 no that's what I do with my team members
21:39 but we have similar forums with the
21:42 upper management that we do every few
21:44 months we present to them something
21:48 yeah okay I actually tried in the past
21:51 to do kind of accomplishments email I
21:53 did like a newsletter of what the team
21:55 does and I think you know it's small
21:57 companies it may be a good idea to do
22:00 that to to give you know in a startup
22:02 that's really helpful to give the the
22:04 rest of the Department's understanding
22:07 of what data science AI team is doing
22:09 and I think that in a big company like
22:12 into it we have a lot of data science
22:13 teams so it's a little bit challenging
22:16 to actually read through those things
22:18 yeah
22:19 how many teams are there
22:22 do you even know
22:23 wow so when I joined we were like a few
22:26 dozens of data scientists and Emily that
22:29 was five and a half years ago we're just
22:30 building up this organization right now
22:33 I think we have a few hundreds of data
22:35 scientists and Emily's and this
22:37 organization is also
22:39 um been unified with the organization of
22:42 the data analysts and data Engineers so
22:46 the entire organization has like 1500
22:48 people uh you know data analysts machine
22:51 learning Engineers data Engineers data
22:53 analysts so and and many of them do work
22:56 around AI so it's very hard to keep up
23:00 with everything that is happening
23:02 exactly
23:04 okay so we talked about managing up
23:06 which is letting your manager or the
23:09 manager of your manager uh or when you
23:12 are a manager
23:13 upper management to know what exactly
23:16 your team is doing and what are the
23:18 accomplishments their accomplishments
23:20 what about like the other two things you
23:23 mentioned manage me managing down and
23:25 managing across what are these things
23:27 let's start with maybe managing down or
23:30 you could mentioned below what is it
23:33 yeah so managing managing down or
23:36 managing below basically means you know
23:39 similar things to build a high
23:41 performance culture
23:43 is
23:44 doing everything that consists of the
23:48 manager score if you are a manager so
23:52 um defining the expectations for your
23:54 team providing them the training the
23:56 resources giving them the feedback the
23:59 recognition and
24:01 making sure they get the guidance they
24:04 need from you
24:06 um
24:07 making sure people are getting a growth
24:11 opportunities in their role
24:15 um
24:17 yeah I think all the aspects of building
24:20 a team making it successful
24:23 so I guess uh the tools you use here are
24:27 like performance reviews uh setting
24:30 goals and all these things right
24:32 yeah yeah definitely we're setting goals
24:35 we have weekly one-on-ones we have
24:37 monthly check-ins in which we review the
24:40 progress of the goals they set to
24:42 themselves
24:44 um
24:45 and you know as I mentioned we provide
24:48 feedback that's really important we
24:51 provide recognition of things
24:55 how does it work like do you like these
24:59 goals that you set and you said like you
25:00 have this monthly check uh checking
25:02 check-in meeting how do you set these
25:05 goals like what kind of framework you
25:07 use for setting these goals and how
25:08 often do you do this
25:10 so we we have a year level goals uh
25:15 which we update sometimes
25:18 um according you know if there is a
25:19 shift in priorities they might be
25:21 changed a little bit
25:23 but
25:25 we do a goal setting session in the
25:28 beginning of the year
25:30 um it it you know which with each person
25:33 individually or with the team no I'm I I
25:37 I did something with the with the entire
25:39 group but you know in the company it
25:41 goes because it's a big company you have
25:43 a lot of levels of hierarchy so it
25:45 starts you know with the most upper
25:47 levels the directors the VP they set and
25:51 their goals and according to that the
25:53 managers set their goals and kind of in
25:56 alignment of the um
25:58 roadmap yeah and then according to that
26:02 the teams and the the team members
26:05 Define their own goals in collaboration
26:09 with their managers so basically we tell
26:12 them okay we share our goals we which
26:15 are more high level and then the people
26:18 according to you know what they think
26:20 they should be doing for the business
26:22 and also what they think they want to
26:24 focus at from their development from
26:27 their personal development they set
26:29 their goals and then they get feedback
26:31 from the manager and we always try to
26:33 set goals
26:35 um which are which have a timeline and
26:39 and also
26:41 um some Metric that we can measure them
26:44 by foreign
26:47 so your manager has goals then you look
26:50 at these goals and what you need to do
26:52 is based on that it's probably some sort
26:54 of VP right so based on their goals you
26:58 need to Define goals for your group
27:00 right and then you have the goals for
27:02 your group then perhaps you have some
27:04 personal development goals too and then
27:06 your manager who your managers who
27:08 report to you your team they look at
27:11 your goals and think okay like which of
27:14 these goals make sense for me and then
27:16 they break them down
27:18 for for each team each manager does the
27:21 same work as you did right so the
27:25 come up with the goals for their own
27:27 teams and then eventually each person in
27:30 their team does the same thing right and
27:32 then this is how they end up with
27:35 individual goals is it correct exactly
27:38 you got it just right and we even have a
27:41 system in which all of those goals are
27:43 we are able to align those to each other
27:45 so if people in a manager's team are
27:48 making progress with their goals and
27:50 they align it to their to his goal then
27:53 the manager will get progress in their
27:55 goal this one
27:57 okay so then at the at the very bottom
28:01 where individuals work they have their
28:04 own goals uh business goals I guess and
28:07 then they also have personal goals for
28:09 example let's say I want to learn more
28:10 about I don't know
28:13 neural networks or whatever
28:15 um right it could be also like a
28:17 personal development goal which uh
28:20 should be related to one of the business
28:22 goals but can be like a separate goal
28:24 right exactly how does it in practice
28:27 look like what's the uh
28:30 fraction between like these business
28:32 goal something will
28:34 self-development goals yeah so if you're
28:37 lucky you're able to achieve the
28:40 Development Goal
28:42 scope of your business work and
28:44 sometimes you know it's not specifically
28:46 have a complete overlap and then you'll
28:50 try to focus you know 10 of your time
28:52 and building those skills you're not
28:55 able to build during your regular work
28:57 day to day
29:00 but I guess the business goals they are
29:01 more like improve this kpi by X percent
29:04 or deliver this thing or open a new
29:10 floor or whatever like Index this amount
29:12 of documents so they are business
29:14 related goals with business metrics
29:16 attached to them
29:18 um but what I was asking more about was
29:20 like okay there are business goals but
29:23 now I open Twitter and I see all these
29:25 things about large language models and
29:27 all that and I want to kind of learn all
29:29 that because I feel like I'm uh missing
29:32 out if I don't do that uh
29:35 which still can be connected to these
29:37 goals right but uh probably I can have
29:40 some individual goals that okay I want
29:43 to learn that thing in order also to see
29:45 how I can contribute the skills I built
29:48 to one of the business goals right
29:51 yes yes you definitely got it yeah yeah
29:54 okay and then say that that in my team
29:58 you know the work we are doing is
30:00 definitely relevant to large language
30:02 models so even if it's your developing
30:04 goals it might be something that you
30:06 will actually work on
30:09 that's cool when you work on NLP stuff
30:12 right this is exactly what your group is
30:15 doing you work on LLP
30:17 yeah
30:18 that's that's cool
30:20 and uh yeah then you have these goals
30:23 and then every month uh you have some
30:26 sort of checkup where you check okay
30:27 like am I uh progressing towards
30:30 achieving those goals do does each of
30:33 these goal
30:34 even make sense or should we rethink
30:37 them right
30:39 so that's managing down and I guess
30:42 [Music]
30:42 um
30:43 like when you look at this how goals
30:45 Cascade down it also makes sense right
30:47 so they go all the way down to
30:49 individuals
30:52 and uh
30:54 yeah what else did we forget about
30:56 anything like you said expectations for
30:59 the team
31:01 feedback recognition growth
31:03 opportunities so we kind of covered all
31:05 that right when it comes to managing
31:06 down
31:09 okay yeah yeah this this is
31:12 a lot about you know the um individuals
31:16 in the team there's also some aspects of
31:19 team building where you want to make
31:22 sure you know you have a good team
31:24 spirit and team atmosphere so you want
31:27 to have a group meeting where there is a
31:29 safe place to share things
31:32 um you want to have those forums when an
31:35 open discussion can be done
31:38 um you know some people run like a a
31:41 book club or a paper Club where they
31:44 review papers together so they have you
31:47 want to open up the space for learning
31:50 you want to make sure you have a place
31:52 you make a place as a manager for
31:54 Innovation
31:56 um in your team and indeed it's really
31:59 nice because we have a hackathon of the
32:04 entire company twice a year
32:07 it's a five days hackathon basically
32:10 it's called a Global Engineering days
32:12 and I really like it because it's it's
32:15 the five days in a year that I get to go
32:17 back to actually be a Hands-On engineer
32:19 myself but basically it's just a few
32:22 days where everyone do you know play
32:24 with whatever technology they like solve
32:26 whatever problems they want to have so
32:28 it's one way to
32:31 encourage Innovation but I also try to
32:35 do some work in encouraging Innovation
32:37 and all the time so finding the balance
32:40 between working on deliveries as well as
32:43 doing some long-term research within the
32:46 team so that's also a lot of the work on
32:48 the manager and of course
32:50 um
32:51 and what we talked about we need to set
32:54 the vision and the roadmap for the team
32:55 so these are things that go in all
32:58 Direction both
33:00 um above sideways and Below
33:04 um a plan for the team there are so many
33:08 aspects of management yeah
33:11 okay yeah interesting and then the last
33:13 thing
33:14 uh the last pillar is managing across
33:17 right so I understand up so like you
33:21 have this hierarchy you manage your
33:22 managers uh then like the hierarchy goes
33:26 down right so you manage your team but
33:28 what is across like is it does it mean
33:30 that in your case for example your group
33:33 manager you collaborate with other group
33:35 managers right and this is the across
33:38 part or what does it mean
33:41 so it will change from organization to
33:43 organization uh one thing would be
33:46 collaboration with other AI managers in
33:49 the organization this would be one
33:51 aspect of that but a lot of that it's
33:53 just working with product teams
33:57 um because we are not a self-sufficient
34:01 product team so we are working
34:02 cross-functionally with different
34:04 product teams across the company and so
34:07 working with them working I have my own
34:11 product managers which handles all of
34:14 the collaborations with product team
34:16 because my team builds reusable Services
34:19 these are used across many offerings add
34:23 into it different offerings of Turbo Tax
34:26 different offering or QuickBooks use our
34:28 services so we maintain relationships
34:30 with a lot of teams so this is also
34:34 um managing across getting product
34:37 requirements translating those to the
34:41 capabilities that the team is building
34:44 and working in collaborating with the
34:49 product teams when our services are
34:51 going to production communicating them
34:54 to expected performance when the
34:57 services are in production maintenance
35:00 of those Services what is the support
35:03 model we are building for their services
35:06 what is the maintenance model
35:09 um
35:09 so all all of those things
35:13 so it means we need to talk with my
35:16 product team I guess you mean like
35:17 engineers and product managers and
35:20 everyone who uh you know not data
35:24 scientists not AI folks yeah
35:27 right okay and what kind of
35:30 management managing across do you need
35:32 in this case uh like how do you actually
35:34 do this with them
35:37 so it's a lot of
35:39 um expectation management uh sharing our
35:42 roadmap a
35:44 communicating you know what is the
35:47 capabilities that we are building how
35:49 are they solving the problems from the
35:54 customers
35:55 um how are they achieving the business
35:58 metrics and what what they should expect
36:01 from them
36:03 um even just you know explaining things
36:07 like these are machine learning models
36:09 they are not perfect they have some
36:12 predicted amount of error so we cannot
36:15 review every error that they have in
36:19 production we want to focus at patterns
36:21 for example things that you know are
36:24 would require a retrain of the model or
36:27 any further more deeper change in the
36:31 model
36:32 um so all of that work educating product
36:36 teams on how does AI look like what we
36:39 can achieve and what we what we cannot
36:43 and I guess the main goal here for
36:45 managing necross is
36:47 making sure that the product teams know
36:50 how important is the stuff you work on
36:52 so they want to help you they want to
36:55 work with you they want to integrate the
36:57 models you build because they know that
37:00 these models contribute to the goals of
37:03 the company and they want to be a part
37:05 of that they also want to contribute to
37:06 the goals of the company right did they
37:08 get it right
37:10 yeah yeah it's even it's even deeper
37:12 than that you know because they come to
37:14 us with their requests so we have to
37:17 explain to them how do we fulfill those
37:19 requests with the with the solutions we
37:23 built
37:24 um so yeah okay so the ask comes from
37:28 the product team so they come to you you
37:30 discuss how exactly you can help so you
37:33 need to make sure that you set the
37:36 expectations right and this is the
37:37 expectation management aspect you
37:39 mentioned then you need to make sure
37:42 that there are no unreasonable
37:43 unreasonable
37:45 requests so then you need to talk about
37:47 education so they know what is possible
37:49 to achieve and I guess it's also kind of
37:52 related to expectation management and
37:54 then based on that you come up with a
37:57 roadmap you share this roadmap with them
37:59 and you start working right and then
38:01 um
38:02 probably also need to somehow let them
38:04 know that how exactly you're progressing
38:07 what is the state you're in so they know
38:10 when exactly they can start integrating
38:12 Your solution right yeah definitely we
38:15 we try to meet with them regularly and
38:18 discuss the progress and raise questions
38:20 we also have like joined slack channels
38:23 and we in which we can you know raise
38:25 questions and get their questions about
38:27 things
38:29 um yeah I think that one more more a one
38:33 important thing we kind of talked about
38:34 but didn't is also we need to give as AI
38:37 leaders we need to give product the
38:40 perspective of what kind of problem is
38:42 suitable for an AI solution and what not
38:46 um
38:47 so this is another aspect of our mutual
38:50 work with product
38:52 and and also I wanted to mention that
38:55 it's not always requests coming from
38:57 products uh in many cases because we are
39:01 the one who plays with the data with the
39:04 better understanding of the data of a AI
39:07 Technologies in many times we will push
39:10 in the other direction and tell them you
39:12 have to adopt this this will help the
39:14 customers so also making that case and
39:18 making sure they integrate those
39:20 Solutions build the right product
39:21 experience to to handle them
39:25 so it's not only coming from them it's
39:27 not only the product teams come to you
39:29 and say hey implement this but you also
39:31 know that if they add this feature or
39:34 this capability it will be better user
39:37 experience right so you come to them
39:38 with suggestions hey this is what we can
39:40 do uh in our team what do you think
39:43 about this does it sound interesting do
39:45 you want to integrate it in the future
39:46 and how exactly this integration will
39:48 look like
39:51 I see so this is managing across it's a
39:54 managing app managing your management
39:57 managing down is managing the team
39:59 managing the crosses managing the people
40:01 you need to work with when you actually
40:04 deliver your solutions to the product
40:06 teams
40:08 anything else we forgot
40:12 um
40:13 no okay
40:17 uh
40:19 yeah we have a few questions so maybe
40:21 I'll go and check these questions
40:23 um so a question from Patrick is
40:26 this is there any major difference that
40:29 you notice
40:31 regarding management of data science
40:33 teams versus usual business teams so
40:36 maybe you talk to your Pearson
40:37 management and you discuss that okay
40:39 there are some
40:41 differences in that
40:44 uh yeah I think that um
40:48 everyone who has worked in a AI team
40:52 knows that there's a lot more risk and a
40:56 lot more unknowns when you are working
40:58 on a project that is reliant on data
41:02 um because until you get into the data
41:06 explore it play with it you don't really
41:08 know how relevant it is to actually
41:10 solve the problem and in some cases you
41:14 know the results just won't be good
41:16 enough
41:18 um so there are a lot more unknowns and
41:21 also in many cases
41:23 um things will pop up and will take more
41:26 time than expected
41:28 um
41:29 from various reasons the technology is
41:34 not suitable and there are certain
41:36 aspects of data sensitivity or data
41:40 security that you need to address in
41:42 your work
41:44 um
41:45 things that come from production well
41:47 that's also true maybe for engineering
41:49 teams but sometimes we have things we
41:51 need to maintain from production that
41:53 interrupt
41:55 the plans and so there are a lot of
41:58 unknowns I think
42:00 um and it's hard to communicate that to
42:02 to product and that's why it's important
42:05 as you said Alex say that we need to
42:08 build a plan with the milestones and
42:10 communicate that in advance so
42:12 um I know that maybe when this role has
42:15 started uh um you know being a thing
42:18 data scientist that would go and
42:21 research for months and then they will
42:23 come up with something so we really try
42:25 to avoid that and try to have you know
42:27 rapid experimentation rapid
42:29 communication and showing the progress
42:32 and getting feedback and try to deliver
42:35 small parts as possible
42:39 now yesterday we had another interview
42:42 it was about software engineering
42:45 practices for machine learning and the
42:47 guest Nadia mentioned that it's quite
42:50 difficult right now to merge the data
42:53 science process like how we deliver
42:55 projects and with data science with
42:57 traditional software engineering
42:58 processes like a scrum kanban all that
43:02 so I'm wondering how does the process
43:05 look like for your case in your case for
43:07 your teams how do they work on I know
43:10 let's say you have an idea a business or
43:12 a product team comes to you with an idea
43:14 how does it typically look like from the
43:17 beginning when this idea when you just
43:19 start discussing this idea to actually
43:21 deliver on this I know like it can be a
43:24 talk on its own but maybe you can
43:25 briefly walk us through it yeah so
43:28 actually my current team does work in
43:31 scrum and scrum team
43:34 yeah it's actually
43:36 um the team that I lead right now is a
43:38 mix of data scientists and machine
43:40 learning Engineers because we have the
43:42 model part but we have Services we build
43:46 um on top of those models so we have a
43:48 lot of engineering work in our team
43:50 because it may be that one service will
43:54 include multiple models that we merge
43:56 together
43:58 um so these are complex services so
44:02 um so yeah there's our mlas and data
44:06 scientists in all three scrum teams they
44:08 are all working together and they work
44:10 in Sprints two-week Sprints like the
44:12 rest of the company they do Sprint
44:14 planning we do retrospective as a group
44:19 um they try the size all of those tasks
44:22 according to the amount of unknown they
44:24 have in each of the tasks I was going to
44:27 ask about that because with the amount
44:29 of known in AI teams and data science
44:31 teams it's very different from software
44:33 engineering teams where it's a lot
44:35 easier to scope the problem to
44:37 understand okay like this thing will
44:39 take I don't know five story points or
44:41 whatever right data science it's more
44:43 difficult so how do you handle that
44:50 but it's really it's really hard they
44:52 try to break things to smaller smaller
44:55 points I think that in the data science
44:57 part sometimes it will take longer than
45:00 we expected but they they try to break
45:04 it as much as possible
45:06 um I don't have you know any magic here
45:09 but it's mainly just think about how you
45:11 break things what kind of Milestones you
45:13 can you can you can Define for each of
45:17 those stories we do try
45:20 um when we start a project when we start
45:22 looking at a problem uh we try to do a
45:26 what to think about what would be the
45:28 design first kind of do a brainstorm and
45:31 that I would usually ask the data
45:33 scientist working on the machine
45:35 learning engineer to kind of do some
45:37 exploration for a couple of weeks and
45:40 then present some kind of a a idea of
45:44 what what they think they're going to
45:45 build what they think they're going to
45:46 do after they played a little bit with
45:49 the data and there hours then there's an
45:52 opportunity there
45:54 um to show you know the overall
45:55 direction talk about discuss about the
45:58 plan about the anticipated impact and
46:02 what is the architecture we think we're
46:04 gonna build around this thing and have a
46:07 discussion about those things so I think
46:09 that you know kind of try to plan ahead
46:11 a little bit it helps you um breaks
46:15 things down later
46:17 okay so if there is an unknown because
46:19 like you don't know how exactly this
46:21 data looks like if it's good or not so
46:24 what you do is one ml engineer or one
46:26 data scientist just takes the entire
46:28 Sprint only to explore the data because
46:32 you can say
46:33 we don't know yet we need time to figure
46:35 this out and then they take the entire
46:37 Sprint to figure this out and then they
46:39 say okay this looks promising and this
46:42 uh these are the tasks we need to do in
46:45 order to you know for the next steps
46:49 yeah well it doesn't really translate
46:52 directly to task but more I would expect
46:54 you know this is a overall type of
46:57 solution I would look at this is the
46:59 type of architecture I would anticipate
47:02 and then you know the more and maybe
47:05 it's not a task level but maybe more of
47:07 a story level thing and that task would
47:09 be breakdown you know later Sprint by
47:11 Sprint
47:12 do you do some sort of grooming sessions
47:15 when you actually break down things as a
47:18 team together
47:19 yeah so so the scrum team does that I'm
47:22 I'm not very much involved in that but
47:24 yeah so you because you're a group
47:27 manager right but in the you're the
47:30 people who you manage the manager how
47:32 you call them Frontline managers so they
47:34 are probably involved in these things
47:35 right yeah
47:39 [Music]
47:40 so you have these grooming sessions then
47:42 you have uh I don't know estimation
47:44 sessions when you for each of the or
47:47 maybe it's the same session I don't know
47:48 how it works for you
47:50 um
47:50 so then for two weeks they work on a
47:52 Sprint and then at the end they have a
47:54 retrospective right
47:56 yeah
47:58 yeah and and you know after we do this
48:00 kind of grooming or sizing session I
48:03 asked them to kind of share those
48:04 results maybe and I review it you know
48:07 and ask questions and see if there are
48:10 things they think they missed and also
48:11 we have principal engineer that they
48:13 also look at that and kind of review
48:15 that feedback yeah
48:18 do you know any resources that can that
48:21 talk about scramble data science because
48:23 I'm really curious uh to see how
48:27 this could be implemented
48:30 yeah well
48:32 I'm not sure I do unfortunately
48:36 I did the regulars from training
48:40 um for years and we just tried to you
48:43 know adjust it to what works it's
48:45 internal expertise that you have
48:48 yeah yeah
48:49 I think everyone should just
48:52 there might be some good resources out
48:55 there because you know other people have
48:57 experimented and wrote Things yeah
48:59 exactly not not something specific that
49:01 I can recommend on okay another question
49:04 from Patrick what is in your view the
49:07 most important skill for a manager in
49:09 data science and machine learning
49:12 oh wow there are so many so many skills
49:17 well maybe let's take top three like if
49:20 the most important one is too difficult
49:22 to come up with
49:24 so I think I don't know if these are
49:27 skills but the three pillars are meant I
49:29 mentioned are that there are things you
49:31 need to focus at like lead with a Clear
49:34 Vision
49:35 um drive-winning results build a high
49:37 performing team so you need to try to do
49:40 all of those things and this is why it
49:42 kind of leads me and when I try to do my
49:45 my work it's more like strategy like how
49:48 exactly you manage how exactly you lead
49:51 you follow this principle like what does
49:54 it actually mean to clean do lead with a
49:56 clean Vision this is about uh
50:00 Clarity so you know what exactly team
50:02 will do in the next quarter in the next
50:04 year so having a vision of where you
50:08 want the team to be in a year what is
50:10 the roadmap for this year
50:13 um but it's also communicating as we
50:16 mentioned uh both to leadership and both
50:19 to the team what is expected
50:23 um what is going to happen what's going
50:24 to be the impact and all of those things
50:28 people would not have you know
50:29 ambiguities
50:31 and then okay lead with Clear Vision is
50:34 the first one and the other two can you
50:36 remind us drive winning results
50:40 and drive winning results and this is
50:43 about
50:46 again setting expectations and then
50:48 setting goals or whatever it's about
50:50 making sure we deliver with the highest
50:54 quality and actually make impact for the
50:56 business
50:57 so that's more of the tactics from my
51:00 perspective like lead with the Clear
51:02 Vision is more of a strategy and drive
51:04 winning results is more of the tactic
51:06 making sure
51:08 work that we execute with efficiency so
51:12 it's uh like if we talk about these
51:15 large language models they are fine they
51:17 are fun to play with but also if we play
51:20 with them we also need to make sure that
51:22 we're actually contributing to the
51:23 business goals right it's not like we
51:25 just have fun with uh whatever models uh
51:29 we're doing this because we want to have
51:32 results we want to have impact right and
51:34 that's
51:36 that's what this thing is about right
51:38 exactly and the last one is what build a
51:42 high performing team
51:46 to I think this is what we talked about
51:48 when uh like setting goals and all that
51:51 right so that each team member knows
51:53 what exactly they should do
51:55 and you know
51:57 I'm coaching them given the
52:01 even and if you want to focus at one
52:03 skill that I think it's most important
52:05 for me I think I think is the growth
52:08 mindset which I also mentioned in my
52:11 talk back then because you know there
52:13 are so many skills but the main
52:17 important the the most important thing
52:19 for me at least is to be able as we you
52:22 know we started this in the beginning of
52:24 this talk that I was in the Air Force
52:26 and this is what I learned from them the
52:28 debrief culture this is exactly what it
52:30 is being always in the growth model when
52:34 you get feedback don't you know be sad
52:37 that you're not good at something and
52:39 why did you say this thing about me I'm
52:42 really trying well this is all great but
52:45 you know really
52:47 um understanding how feedback is a gift
52:50 and everything that you didn't do that
52:53 well in the past is an opportunity to
52:55 get better in the future and kind of
52:57 nailing down those areas and those
53:00 things you need to do uh to grow and to
53:03 be better
53:04 and then I realized that our talk is
53:06 called the secret sauce for data science
53:08 management so what is the secret source
53:10 is this a growth mindset
53:14 that's a
53:16 Maybe
53:19 um I think I think that you know all of
53:22 the things we we talked about it's a lot
53:25 about the growth mindset it's a lot
53:27 about internalizing those pillars of
53:30 managements we talked about and
53:32 understanding you know what is what is
53:34 the strategy of of you as a manager to
53:37 handle those things in the organization
53:39 uh you're in what does internalizing
53:42 mean
53:44 um
53:47 it's hard to think about other words
53:50 just you know um take it in really
53:53 believing it living by it yeah
53:56 so doing it basically implementing this
54:00 yeah I implementing it yeah making it a
54:04 belief a value something you go by
54:08 then there is another question which I
54:11 know we don't have a lot of time only
54:12 two minutes I don't know if you can
54:14 answer this in two minutes maybe you can
54:16 give us a
54:17 very brief overview so the question is
54:20 that a lot of data science proof of
54:22 Concepts do not get productionized and
54:25 the fourths are air quote wasted how do
54:28 you increase the chances of a POC being
54:30 successful
54:33 so it's a lot about
54:35 understanding really deeply the customer
54:38 problem you're trying to solve working
54:41 with the product partner and to
54:44 understand
54:44 how it does the customer Story look like
54:48 a working with the customer if you can
54:51 and we call it follow me home actually
54:54 looking at what the customer is doing
54:56 what you can improve and trying to
54:58 choose those problems to solve in which
55:03 you have an opportunity to make an
55:05 impact for the customer and an
55:07 opportunity to show that impact this
55:09 measurable impact and then when you go
55:13 and do that POC try to Define okay I
55:17 want to get this metric from from X to Y
55:20 and then try to show that you have
55:24 achieved that
55:26 um
55:27 so I think it's much easier to make the
55:30 case to get a POC to production if you
55:32 have shown uh some business metric
55:35 has moved due to that
55:39 um and if you have an opportunity to do
55:42 a b testing experimentation to actually
55:45 show it combine it in the project for
55:47 some fraction of the users so that's
55:50 really a great way to kind of push
55:53 things to production in a gradual Manner
55:56 and through through Rapid
55:57 experimentation
55:59 so like somebody focused on solving the
56:03 problem right if you do this and you
56:05 show the impact of on business metrics
56:07 the POC will be successful
56:10 yeah yeah
56:11 hopefully and I'm of course a lot of
56:14 communication with the product side you
56:16 know listen try to see you know how how
56:19 you can really help
56:21 maybe that's also the answer to the
56:23 question earlier from Patrick what is
56:25 the most important skill maybe
56:26 communication is the answer because I
56:28 see that
56:30 a lot about talking like you need to
56:32 talk with the team you need to talk with
56:34 management when you need to talk with
56:36 product teams you need to talk about uh
56:39 understanding this customer problem
56:42 all of this involves talking right so
56:44 you need to be quite good at this
56:46 yeah you definitely need to be a good
56:48 communicator it's one important
56:50 [Music]
56:53 yeah I think that's all we have time for
56:54 today so thanks
56:56 a lot for joining us today for sharing
56:58 your experience we will definitely link
57:00 the talk because I don't think we
57:02 managed to cover most of this I think we
57:04 just talked about like the first couple
57:07 of slides for most of the time but I
57:08 think that went really well but we will
57:11 link The Talk uh if there's anything
57:13 else you want to
57:15 ask to add like maybe anything useful
57:18 that you think that our listeners will
57:20 enjoy that on topic for this please send
57:23 us the links and yeah that's it thanks
57:25 everyone for joining us today
57:27 yeah thank you so much Alex say I I do
57:31 have a few uh blog posts I've written in
57:34 the past about a leading data science
57:36 team about how to streamline the
57:39 development process of AI Solutions so
57:42 I'm happy to share that because
57:44 resources yeah
57:46 okay well uh then have a great weekend
57:49 everyone goodbye
57:52 [Music]
