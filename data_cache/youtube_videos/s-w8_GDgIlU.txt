1:52 carmena and
1:54 carmen and i
1:56 are actually colleagues ex-colleagues so
1:58 carmen worked with me at elix as a
2:00 senior data scientist
2:02 then at some point he left leagues he
2:04 joined entrepreneur first which is i
2:06 think
2:07 like a startup factory sort of so to say
2:10 and now he's a co-founder founder and
2:13 cto at fresh law so welcome
2:16 thank you thank you alexei i'm glad that
2:18 you could invite me here to see you
2:19 again
2:20 um so yeah um
2:22 great uh great introduction uh just to
2:25 get to know me a little bit better so i
2:27 started um basically programming when i
2:29 was a kid at the age of five
2:31 um and then i continued this passion
2:34 like my entire life and uh obviously i
2:36 went to university
2:38 i think i i felt quite
2:41 you know
2:42 fortunate that i could actually know
2:44 what i wanted to do uh in university i
2:46 don't know a lot of people struggle with
2:47 that
2:48 i went directly to
2:50 computer science and did computer
2:52 science
2:53 um uh bachelor in uh university of
2:56 bologna
2:57 and did also like uh some gigs as a
3:00 freelance web developer for around a
3:02 year
3:03 and then i published my thesis uh also
3:06 in a book which is
3:08 the name of the thesis called large
3:10 scale social network analysis
3:12 it was about how to parallelize social
3:15 network analysis algorithms using mpi a
3:18 lot of c plus plus i'm glad i don't have
3:20 to do that again
3:22 but it was really fun if you want to
3:24 check it out it's published on springer
3:26 and then i joined my master in
3:30 university uh free university of
3:32 uh amsterdam
3:34 uh which was in artificial intelligence
3:36 and then since then i just fell in love
3:38 with it and uh continued doing data
3:40 science for five years including at oil
3:42 x that's another consultancy before
3:44 and uh at another startup before and
3:47 then after olx i uh well during olx
3:50 actually i went to oleg squared which is
3:52 the moonshot theme of olex
3:54 where you can innovate as much as you
3:56 want
3:57 um
3:57 and then after that i joined the data
4:00 science for social goods in the alan
4:01 turing institute which is a research
4:03 institution in the uk
4:06 for data science and machine learning um
4:08 so mentored some students there and we
4:10 helped the world bank and
4:13 ofsted which is the office of standards
4:16 for earlier child care in the uk
4:18 uh with some really exciting data
4:21 analytics which maybe i can show later
4:23 and
4:24 after that i
4:26 decided to join entrepreneur first but
4:28 of course the story doesn't doesn't
4:30 start like that right you just don't
4:32 want to start a company from the one day
4:33 to another
4:36 yeah so i also have a five year like you
4:39 you said you started programming as a
4:41 five-year-old kid and
4:43 i was five-year-old so maybe in another
4:46 uh some other time i'll learn how to
4:48 actually teach you a bit of programming
4:51 uh it's just us to be really not excited
4:53 about watching tv that was the thing
4:55 that was the key
4:57 interesting
4:59 [Laughter]
5:01 everybody's on
5:04 okay um
5:06 yeah so tell us a bit about your startup
5:08 what do you do there sure so um as you
5:11 said i'm a co-founder cto of flash flow
5:13 fresh flow is a
5:15 complete ordering system for
5:17 supermarkets
5:18 and what we want to solve is the
5:21 enormous food waste problem that we have
5:23 in the world so
5:26 and also make more money for
5:27 supermarkets and make more money for us
5:29 so we have this really nice triple
5:31 bottom line uh which makes us a
5:33 profitable business well not yet but we
5:35 will in the future hopefully and also
5:37 will make more money for for the
5:39 supermarkets and benefit the the planet
5:41 so
5:42 the problem that we saw uh and
5:44 especially um avik saw actually when
5:47 which is my co-founder which when
5:50 he was trying to sell to supermarkets
5:53 um another solution which was based on
5:56 computer vision
5:57 he saw that actually a bigger problem
6:00 that they used to have and they still
6:02 have is what to order exactly especially
6:05 for fresh products
6:06 so the problem with fresh products is
6:08 that they have varying shelf lifes
6:11 and there's highly variable shelf lifes
6:14 so even the same
6:16 i don't know type of product like
6:17 mangoes
6:18 one batch could have like a week
6:21 left or another batch could have like
6:23 two days left
6:24 um and it is really really hard to
6:26 predict all of that and to predict how
6:29 many you need at what time etc etc
6:32 but most supermarkets we found that uh
6:34 they still use people on the floor so
6:37 there are like so-called fresh product
6:39 managers
6:40 that they actually every single day they
6:42 spend two hours
6:43 looking at the shelves
6:45 and looking at what they have in the
6:46 back uh to figure out what they actually
6:49 have to order
6:50 and um we when we started our pilot our
6:53 first pilot with uh with edica uh here
6:56 which is the largest german supermarket
6:59 if anyone is watching pilot with them
7:02 that's that's awesome yeah with one uh
7:05 one store right now and there we're
7:07 signing with other stores uh so that's
7:10 cool in the future yeah
7:12 uh and uh yeah we we went there we did
7:15 user research which is a thing that uh
7:17 um actually we learned at oleg squared
7:19 it was a great experience there working
7:21 with the designers from coast
7:25 and
7:28 we saw that the fresh product people uh
7:31 they go there at 6 00 a.m in the morning
7:34 they have a lot of like boxes to move
7:35 around
7:37 and then once they move around all these
7:38 boxes
7:40 which takes a couple of hours
7:42 they put all the things in place and
7:44 then they start the ordering process for
7:46 the next day so they have to calculate
7:48 what is going to be the demand
7:50 you know the next day
7:52 they have to think about it in their
7:53 head they have to think about weather
7:55 they have to think about
7:56 seasonality differences
7:58 uh is for example i don't know is there
8:00 a big event in the in the town
8:03 uh in the specific town where we're
8:05 doing the pilot for example there is a
8:06 big
8:07 like um
8:09 ramp let's say uh to go to the to the
8:12 supermarket and if that ramp for example
8:14 is full of snow nobody will go to the
8:16 supermarket so all these kind of things
8:18 in their heads for 200 products it's
8:21 insane it is really an incredible work
8:23 and i'm
8:24 amazed actually that
8:26 that works at all
8:28 uh so they're doing a great job but of
8:30 course
8:31 you know as we are humans and we're not
8:33 we're not calculators uh so
8:36 basically we create a ordering system uh
8:39 that it lives in an ipad app for all
8:41 they know
8:43 lives mostly in the cloud to be honest
8:45 uh which uses machine learning and
8:48 reinforcement learning actually
8:50 and to
8:51 to figure out the perfect order oh cool
8:54 so i heard that uh this uh position is
8:57 called fresh product manager right so
8:59 you know uh product managers but they do
9:02 it to licks
9:03 a different kind of product manager
9:05 right absolutely manage actually manage
9:07 manage products right yeah it's a lot
9:10 less about politics and a lot more about
9:13 what is
9:14 how many
9:15 uh strawberries you have to order for
9:17 the next basically every store in every
9:20 company uh like every supermarket they
9:22 have this sort of position right so they
9:24 have to wake up at six a.m in the
9:26 morning they have to
9:27 do go like around to look at the shelves
9:30 and say okay like these mangoes are
9:33 getting spoiled we need to do something
9:35 about them right yeah they do this every
9:37 day and uh it's a lot of manual work
9:40 they also have to
9:41 uh you know wake up early while i guess
9:43 everyone is uh
9:45 at home still like before the shop opens
9:47 right yeah exactly it's a very tough
9:50 work uh we were amazed that uh uh you
9:52 know there
9:53 were these these ladies that could do
9:55 that
9:56 um at
9:57 that early in the morning and also keep
10:00 fresh to
10:01 you know think about all these other
10:03 factors
10:04 and uh honestly we were struggling with
10:06 my co-founder to follow them they were
10:08 so fast
10:09 uh it was it was really amazing really
10:11 amazing so you was you were just sitting
10:13 with them watching how they work and
10:14 then trying to replicate it
10:17 uh yeah we were shadowing them uh for a
10:19 couple of days so we went there for a
10:20 week
10:22 this is actually how we work in general
10:24 it's called design thinking so
10:26 we do
10:27 a few steps that you see in the design
10:30 thinking methodologies there are many
10:32 design thinking methodologies
10:33 uh so
10:35 we follow usually from my experience
10:38 with the olex squared and with the book
10:40 uh design thinking by curedale
10:42 highly recommended by the way
10:45 and it also it's very much appreciated
10:47 by our clients that we do that because
10:50 we are able to really figure out what
10:53 are the processes how things go on in
10:55 the store and then deliver the solution
10:58 that they actually need instead of that
10:59 we think they need which is a big
11:02 learning that i had from from that
11:03 experience in yx squared
11:05 um and also to be honest from from ef uh
11:07 they also push another book which is
11:09 really interesting which i also
11:10 recommend is called
11:11 the mom test i would say it's a much
11:13 lighter version
11:15 of design thinking
11:17 and it's mostly
11:19 to gather towards
11:21 you know entrepreneurs and to do how to
11:24 do sales calls and stuff like that
11:26 but it does help you figure out what to
11:29 ask
11:30 and you want to ask things that
11:32 actually make the user tell you uh all
11:35 their processes and not tell you the
11:37 solution that they want
11:39 because between what they want and what
11:41 they need there's always a bit of a
11:42 difference to be honest
11:43 okay interesting
11:45 and uh
11:47 i don't think you just woke up one day
11:49 and realized okay there is this problem
11:51 uh let's just you know uh
11:54 leave for elixir and solve it right so
11:56 there probably something happened like
11:58 uh
11:59 so i'm curious how did you actually come
12:02 uh up with this idea um what did the
12:05 process look like
12:07 yeah it was uh very interesting so i
12:09 joined entrepreneur first because i
12:11 wanted to be uh i wanted to have a
12:14 startup uh this was a desire that i had
12:16 since i was in my bachelor
12:18 but i never really thought you didn't
12:20 know what exactly you'll do right yeah
12:22 exactly there's there were a few ideas
12:24 that i had um
12:26 but i didn't i tried to like um
12:30 have some people and try to ideate with
12:33 some people and maybe come up with some
12:35 some i don't know ideas for a startup
12:37 and stuff
12:38 but um
12:39 in the end it didn't really materialize
12:42 um shout out to xander as well
12:45 and uh the
12:47 the problem is that you're always so
12:49 busy so we were trying during you know
12:52 also having a job at the same time and
12:54 um
12:56 uh it was it was really hard um you need
12:59 to really dedicate your life to it and
13:02 to find like what is a what is a good
13:04 idea unless you have a good idea already
13:06 and also like to find a co-founder is
13:07 really hard that also has the same
13:09 amount of time on the same like life
13:12 circumstances
13:13 um and so
13:16 in the end when i received the call from
13:18 entrepreneur first i didn't know about
13:20 them and this was around february when i
13:22 was in oleg squared in february 2020
13:27 and i was
13:28 already um
13:30 i already got the position at the elle
13:32 entering institute at the time so
13:34 i was uh really keen on like first doing
13:37 these two things because they were so
13:38 cool
13:39 uh and they told me that actually uh the
13:42 other cohort
13:43 would start in september and that would
13:45 be exactly in line with uh with the rest
13:47 of my timeline so i thought yeah that's
13:48 perfect
13:49 fine um so
13:51 i reapplied uh them for the september
13:53 cohort uh got in and um yeah i had like
13:57 an amazing time to be honest
13:59 so
14:00 in entrepreneur first it's really
14:02 interesting because they so the tagline
14:04 is the word um leader talent investor
14:08 um
14:09 so they they call themselves talent
14:11 investor because essentially they take
14:12 you in because you don't have you have
14:15 the potential to be a co-founder because
14:18 of your career path what you did in the
14:20 past is quite interesting the
14:22 uh the growth that you have is pretty
14:24 big or you i don't know know something
14:27 very specific that nobody else knows in
14:29 the world
14:30 and um
14:33 they basically take a bunch of people
14:35 like that in the same like space uh they
14:38 give you a bunch of talks on how to do
14:39 sales how to do
14:41 uh marketing how to like this is
14:44 something that uh technical people like
14:46 you like me we usually don't know these
14:49 things right so we don't know how to
14:51 uh like marketing is a
14:54 i have no idea like what marketing
14:55 people do
14:57 so it's really nice of them that they uh
14:59 also teach you
15:01 um all these things
15:03 yeah absolutely uh they have like they
15:06 have experts that they are either called
15:08 in or they're already in entrepreneur
15:10 first
15:12 for example for sales
15:14 like guys that exited companies for many
15:16 many times they're venture partners
15:18 there because essentially it's a
15:19 ultimately it's a kind of venture
15:21 capital um
15:23 for pre-seed companies but they operate
15:25 quite differently
15:26 and so they have these venture partners
15:29 that are very experienced and they will
15:30 talk about these these topics uh
15:32 absolutely recommended uh there were
15:34 even talks by
15:36 um ben evans for example which is one of
15:38 the
15:39 best
15:40 people in the vc space i used to be
15:43 uh at uh andres and aurovitz as well
15:46 he's now a global venture partner there
15:49 and many other people that are perhaps
15:50 less known but uh really really
15:52 good yeah interesting so so they put you
15:56 through this training right yeah but i
15:58 guess that's not the only thing they do
16:00 right
16:01 no no no no of course uh
16:04 well they
16:05 um
16:06 they assist you with like some sort of
16:10 framework on how to find a co-founder
16:13 so first of all you go there and you
16:14 kind of know if you're a cto type or a
16:16 ceo type even though like there may be
16:19 some exception spoiler alert
16:22 um so
16:24 usually um
16:26 you know if you're if you're a technical
16:28 background you're a cto type if you have
16:29 a more business minded background or a
16:32 domain edge what they call it uh you're
16:34 a seo type and they have the scientist
16:37 maybe would be a cto and product manager
16:39 would be a ceo roughly yeah roughly
16:42 absolutely
16:43 um it could also change
16:46 um
16:46 but let's see let's go there later so
16:50 the idea is that they have so-called
16:53 edges
16:54 and you fit in one or two edges
16:58 so the edges that ef has our
17:02 catalyst edge uh domain edge and
17:05 technical edge
17:07 and so uh catalyst edge they're actually
17:10 further defined as catalyst doers and
17:11 catalyst stalkers so the catalyst doers
17:14 are the ones that are very energetic
17:17 they can make basically almost anything
17:20 uh they don't have like a specific
17:23 technical edge that is so sharp that
17:25 only like
17:26 10 people in the world have
17:28 but they're more widespread like data
17:30 science for example would be full stack
17:32 person right full stack person
17:34 uh us for example we're catalyst doers
17:36 for for ef
17:38 um and catalyst talkers are like
17:43 you know flexible business people
17:44 essentially right so they kind of kind
17:46 of the same thing but on the business
17:47 side
17:48 uh and then there are domain edges and
17:51 domain edges are basically
17:53 people that have very very specific
17:55 in-depth knowledge of a specific domain
17:58 so for example one of my uh let's say
18:01 co-founders so at the time
18:03 we were starting uh a company with him
18:06 uh with unif
18:08 and he had deep expertise in the pharma
18:11 space so he worked he was a general
18:14 manager at uh defenians which then got
18:17 acquired by astrazeneca
18:19 uh and then he worked there for like 20
18:21 years uh absolute master about
18:25 you know computer vision in pharma and
18:28 that's a definite domain edge
18:30 and then tech edges are
18:33 people that have very very specific
18:35 skills in something
18:37 in some tech so for example there was a
18:39 guy that
18:40 did this phd thesis on 3d printing uh
18:43 human hearts
18:44 like i don't know that many people that
18:46 do that
18:48 because it can get rid of yeah
18:50 absolutely yeah
18:52 um
18:53 yeah shout out to martin
18:55 and javier
18:57 and yeah
18:59 they
19:00 give you this framework in order to
19:02 start the conversation with the other
19:03 people
19:04 so then if you are let's say a domain
19:07 edge you would definitely talk about
19:09 your domain
19:11 um if you're a tech edge you definitely
19:13 talk about that specific uh thing if
19:15 you're a catalyst it's a bit more fluffy
19:17 you talk about what you're most uh
19:21 expert at
19:23 and um see what are the
19:25 inter interweaving uh threads that you
19:28 can find with the other people
19:31 uh and yeah they're very interesting
19:33 conversation so it's really like one of
19:35 the best times ever
19:37 [Music]
19:39 you can talk about crazy things from one
19:41 day to another you can have like 10
19:43 conversation in one day where they span
19:45 between
19:46 i don't know like how to solve the
19:48 climate issue uh to i don't know how to
19:51 make uh
19:52 a specific dashboard for fintech
19:55 companies you know there could be
19:56 anything in between
19:58 and so you also go with your own gut
20:00 feeling trying to see
20:01 who you think you will fit with
20:03 um and what kind of
20:06 like what kind of ideas are you most
20:08 drawn to and then of course you bring
20:10 your own ideas uh and you see you test
20:12 them a little bit
20:14 and then they have mentors uh which
20:16 every single week they have uh call with
20:18 you so there are two mentors actually
20:21 one is the
20:22 let's call it the relationship mentor
20:25 so you can ask about hey what what what
20:27 can i how can i approach people
20:29 between that or
20:31 i don't know like
20:33 my current co-founder i don't know
20:35 there's something wrong with our
20:36 relationship backing with exit
20:38 and
20:40 then the other mentor which you get only
20:42 if you have a team
20:44 um it's
20:46 it's a quite experienced usually in the
20:48 startup space um
20:51 and it will tell you a lot about like
20:53 uh what are you doing good or what are
20:55 you doing wrong in terms of like uh
20:57 market sizing uh figuring out if the
21:00 idea has any chance of of working
21:02 essentially
21:04 and they give you a score also every
21:06 single week which is between one and
21:08 four
21:09 which tells you more or less like how
21:12 they think
21:13 you're going to do at the final
21:15 examination
21:17 which is called investment committee
21:20 which is in uh january
21:23 so this entire thing starts in september
21:24 in january then uh
21:26 you are you're in the investment
21:28 committee actually let's just say this
21:29 is divided in a few phases so the first
21:31 phase is called the form phase
21:34 which is i think eight weeks
21:36 and uh the forum phase is the phase
21:38 where you try to find your co-founder
21:41 and then after the forum phase you just
21:44 have to say this is my co-founder and
21:46 then you can pass through the company
21:48 building phase
21:50 and then the company building phase
21:51 basically you have to prepare all the
21:53 material that you need for the
21:54 investment committee and the investment
21:56 committee is a bunch of venture partners
21:58 from from ef and we had actually
22:00 benedict evans in our committee
22:03 uh amongst others
22:05 so it was a bit intimidating but it was
22:09 very very helpful and very uh very
22:12 useful for us also in the future and
22:13 they unfortunately passed
22:15 so they decide basically if they want to
22:17 invest or not right that's the final
22:18 examination that's a final examination
22:21 yeah and if they want to invest they you
22:23 know you get money if they don't yeah
22:26 then bye-bye
22:28 but i guess some people still try to
22:30 pursue their idea right just that's true
22:33 to find other way to
22:35 uh to like find other investors
22:38 yeah
22:39 yeah um
22:40 so some other people that didn't get
22:42 investments they got other grants or
22:44 they were incubated in other incubators
22:47 uh or they went for competitors ovf like
22:49 entler
22:51 so
22:52 in the end you know if you want if you
22:54 want it you can do it that's uh
22:57 that's a big lesson actually you you
22:59 mentioned that your co-founder has
23:00 experience in uh pharma right uh
23:04 that was my previous co-founder so i had
23:06 a few teams in ef um
23:10 and
23:10 my current co-founder which is
23:12 i should say the co-founder because it's
23:15 my co-founder uh and it was not just a
23:18 team in ef
23:20 is actually a machine learning scientist
23:22 also
23:23 a similar background much younger he's
23:25 26.
23:26 uh he just graduated from eth zurich and
23:30 he was actually quite active in the
23:32 entrepreneur space so
23:34 he founded i think this is now his third
23:36 company oh just quite insane at 26. so
23:39 yes
23:40 shout out to havoc i don't know what
23:42 awesome more insane is programming at 5
23:45 or
23:45 [Laughter]
23:48 thanks man i hope that all of these
23:50 credentials will come up
23:52 in uh
23:54 in our products um
23:56 so
23:57 yeah he's uh he's also very impressive
23:59 in that sense um
24:01 and um
24:03 he founded the company in
24:05 uh motion analysis uh then another one
24:08 in uh cryptocurrency
24:10 in china actually while he was studying
24:12 and now fresh flow as well and he's the
24:14 ceo so he's handling the business
24:17 side uh and we decided like that just
24:20 because uh i i think
24:22 uh it fits more with what our
24:24 backgrounds are so like um i have a
24:27 longer uh technical experience and he
24:30 has longer entrepreneurial experience so
24:32 i think it's just it just works and it's
24:33 great to have a technical co-founder so
24:35 we were kind of also the exception
24:36 that's why i said spoiler alert before
24:39 yeah and i see already we have quite a
24:41 few questions in live chat and
24:43 i am wondering so one question from
24:45 eddie is uh
24:47 how when and why this idea of your
24:49 business come to your mind because from
24:52 what i understood about your co-founder
24:54 he's also not like he doesn't strike me
24:56 like as a person who spent his life in
24:59 uh you know oversea in the supermarket
25:02 right
25:03 how did you actually
25:04 get this idea
25:06 yeah that's a good question so um as i
25:09 said before he was developing this
25:13 computer vision product recognition uh
25:16 thing
25:17 um
25:18 during his thesis and um
25:20 he basically started to sell it to
25:23 different supermarkets
25:24 he started to have calls with different
25:26 supermarkets being entrepreneurially
25:28 minded as he is right
25:30 and
25:31 during these calls uh he realized that
25:33 actually there is a lot of there are a
25:34 lot of problems also in how these
25:36 supermarkets order food
25:39 right so there was already something in
25:41 his mind
25:42 then uh at the same time like when i
25:44 broke up with the my team so the the
25:47 pharma
25:49 guy
25:50 he also broke up with his uh
25:52 teammate at the time which was also in
25:54 healthcare by the way and
25:57 we found each other at basically the
25:59 last week before the closing of the of
26:02 the program of the forum phase and we
26:05 really wanted to have a startup like
26:06 absolutely
26:08 100 there was no question uh in my mind
26:10 that i was not gonna go out with a
26:12 startup out of that
26:14 and uh we were friends from the
26:16 beginning
26:17 with avik uh so we were always having
26:19 beers uh
26:20 and uh the
26:22 uh the thing that we were also trying to
26:24 ideate with other people obviously
26:26 because you want to stick to what the ef
26:28 people say you know try to find a
26:29 business uh like
26:31 a business person that started from
26:33 business right so we were talking with a
26:35 couple of people but we found that you
26:37 know we were actually ideating much
26:39 faster between each other
26:40 and so
26:42 we started ideating about like uh
26:45 product recognition uh if we could use
26:47 perhaps what is done in his thesis and
26:50 we started thinking about uh oh can we
26:52 do something uh for pricing for example
26:56 right so
26:57 we can recognize uh what these products
26:59 if these products are going bad like i
27:01 was thinking also in a
27:03 um
27:04 let's say social good sense
27:06 a little bit because it's kind of dear
27:08 to my heart to do something for the for
27:09 climate change uh that was a big topic
27:12 also between my projects in ef
27:14 and uh
27:16 in the end we
27:18 we started to see that there are a lot
27:20 of problems with uh shelf life um with
27:24 estimating shelf life and
27:26 and keeping track of what is going bad
27:28 etc etc so we started ideating in that
27:31 sense can we do something with computer
27:33 vision that looks at fresh products
27:35 and
27:37 you know tells
27:38 you know the people that are buying the
27:40 fresh products
27:41 um
27:42 are these going bad
27:44 and we started ideating on that and we
27:46 thought oh maybe we can do an app
27:48 that can do that
27:50 and uh on we went actually to so-called
27:53 super check-in which is like a mini ic a
27:56 mini investment committee
27:58 uh with that idea which is basically
28:00 uh an app
28:03 that
28:04 you can use as a consumer and you can go
28:06 in the store with
28:08 uh and then you would take a photo of
28:10 like
28:10 a fresh product or like a packaged
28:13 product you will take a photo of the
28:14 barcode or something and the and the um
28:17 expiring expiration date
28:20 i mean instead of for fresh products we
28:21 will do the analysis of the rightness in
28:24 in the app using computer vision
28:27 and then it will give you a discount
28:28 that then you can apply at checkout
28:31 didn't fly very well with the investment
28:33 committee to be honest so
28:35 we went back to the drawing board and we
28:37 honestly we learned from that we learned
28:38 that
28:40 it was
28:41 first of all it was really hard for
28:43 people to
28:45 get another app just to get some
28:46 discounts even though there are
28:47 discounts sometimes it's not enough
28:50 um and then we learned that um
28:53 yeah
28:54 it's not that easy actually to figure
28:55 out the shelf life of fresh products
28:57 just using computer vision
29:00 um so we
29:01 we pivoted
29:03 and uh we started
29:05 like thinking and while thinking you
29:06 realized oh wait i remember this
29:08 conversation that i had with these uh
29:10 these people
29:12 and i remember that actually uh
29:14 waste and stockouts
29:16 are a huge problem
29:18 and we kind of wanted to avoid all that
29:20 because both let's say our edges are
29:22 definitely in computer vision like we we
29:24 did a lot of computer vision
29:26 um but we uh
29:28 we we saw that
29:30 uh this could actually be a much bigger
29:32 problem
29:34 um and when we started looking at the
29:35 numbers and then we started looking
29:36 about the numbers about food waste and
29:39 it's completely mind-boggling
29:41 just to give you
29:43 uh like an idea so food waste uh is
29:47 actually accounting for six times more
29:49 carbon emissions per year than the
29:51 entire aviation industry oh
29:54 that's uh that's a lot right it's insane
29:57 like when i read that i was like i
29:59 cannot believe this this is crazy yeah
30:01 this is uh very crazy yeah and uh we're
30:04 wasting like 1.7 trillion dollars per
30:07 year
30:08 in food like food that gets never sold
30:11 basically
30:12 but someone has to buy it right the
30:13 supermarkets have to buy it
30:16 uh and supermarkets out of all food
30:18 waste
30:19 contribute to 10 of that so if we can
30:22 contribute to ten percent
30:24 of uh six times the aviation industry
30:27 we're almost like fixing the aviation
30:30 industry right there so that'll be
30:32 fantastic um and um
30:35 so we we got really really excited and
30:37 then we saw that also there are some
30:39 exceptional companies in the us
30:42 that are doing something similar to us
30:44 um
30:45 some of them are shelf engine and afresh
30:47 and
30:48 they are uh they're doing really well uh
30:50 and um
30:52 we really really appreciate what they're
30:53 doing and we just wanted to follow suit
30:55 and
30:56 start our own companies fresh flow here
30:59 nice um the questions from anika and i'm
31:02 also wondering
31:03 now how important is to go through a
31:06 startup accelerator in this case would
31:08 you be able to do this without
31:09 entrepreneur first or no way no
31:13 as simple as that
31:14 uh to i think to have the kind of
31:17 connections that entrepreneur first
31:19 gives you
31:20 um you need to be extremely lucky
31:24 maybe go to a very specific
31:27 place
31:28 in life like for example i think in
31:31 avik's case ath helped a lot because
31:33 they have an entrepreneur uh kind of
31:35 club
31:37 and so if you're already interested in
31:38 that you join the club and you see like
31:40 a lot of people that have ideas
31:42 professors that can help etc etc people
31:45 that actually create their startups uh
31:47 during university time
31:49 if you're in the ivy league of course
31:51 there are a lot of people that also uh
31:52 in this university they start startups
31:55 but uh you know from
31:56 free university of amsterdam there was
31:58 no such thing uh and from the university
32:01 of amsterdam sorry university of bologna
32:04 uh i didn't find uh anything like that
32:06 um
32:07 and i didn't look around on my brief
32:09 time at university of amsterdam so like
32:11 i didn't have these kind of
32:12 possibilities
32:13 so that really
32:15 changes the game completely like i have
32:18 a lot of friends now from entrepreneur
32:19 first just because we vibe so much
32:21 together it's like
32:22 we're all so ambitious and creative and
32:25 kind of risk-taking so
32:27 yeah definitely you need you need to
32:28 kind of write them but it's about uh
32:31 building connections it's about
32:32 networking right so if you have already
32:34 a strong network from your university or
32:37 maybe i know and i know that in berlin
32:39 for example there are
32:42 startup
32:43 meetups for example or founder dating
32:46 meetups so if you're in this area maybe
32:48 it's possible right to build this
32:49 network but uh entrepreneur first helps
32:52 you to do that yeah
32:54 and i would say still hard uh even
32:56 though you would have the network then
32:58 you need to find a co-founder that
33:00 is really jiving with you
33:02 and uh you need to have the time to also
33:04 think about uh the the idea and really
33:07 develop it and kind of try to do it as
33:09 quickly as possible
33:10 uh that's always the conundrum of being
33:12 in a startup you want to always be one
33:14 step ahead than you are and so that
33:16 requires a lot of time so
33:18 um yeah i would say without entrepreneur
33:21 first would have been really really hard
33:23 so how did you find your first client so
33:27 get like running a pilot with etica i
33:28 think it's awesome so is it your first
33:31 client
33:32 yeah well technically we had also on our
33:34 clients uh which came from
33:36 uh avik's previous dwellings in in the
33:40 supermarket space so this autoclient is
33:42 actually volk which is the third largest
33:44 supermarket chain in uh in switzerland
33:48 but involved we tried
33:50 like a slightly different product so
33:53 uh from volgo uh we did like a pilot and
33:57 it all went well uh but for the
33:59 let's say uh the the first client in
34:02 germany um which is erica we actually
34:05 entered through the eleka futa campus
34:07 which is a startup accelerator by erika
34:11 where they also give you mentorship and
34:14 they try to connect you to the right
34:16 edica stores that are perhaps more
34:18 open-minded to new things
34:20 and
34:22 yeah after explaining our idea they we
34:24 got in uh really nice people at the
34:26 foottech campus they connected to the
34:28 right uh to the right people in in edica
34:31 and we refined
34:33 our idea and we refined our product and
34:35 then we started working with um with eda
34:37 capacious
34:39 was it before you mediated the
34:41 entrepreneur first or after after after
34:44 after okay yeah so you don't need to get
34:47 a client to graduate right
34:49 um well it would be beneficial
34:53 but they bet on us first of all we we
34:56 formed at the last week of forum so we
34:58 had only like
34:59 three weeks
35:00 four four weeks to really like
35:04 get all of the narrative together get
35:06 this like the pitch deck uh get the all
35:09 of all of the things together um
35:12 all of the possibilities for the future
35:14 the business model blah blah
35:16 so quite a lot of work in a short amount
35:18 of time uh and then
35:21 after that yeah you start with with
35:23 really building but
35:24 and also we started building the the
35:26 algorithms and stuff at the same time so
35:28 it was quite busy anyway
35:30 but yeah other startups
35:32 they also may need to show that they
35:34 have some traction early on we already
35:36 had some traction at the time actually
35:38 now that i remember we had quite a few
35:40 leads
35:42 with other supermarket chains in italy
35:45 and in germany
35:46 uh which in the end it didn't uh didn't
35:48 go through but uh yeah we had actually
35:50 like around four or five
35:53 leads so yeah there needs to be some
35:55 traction for sure so how much time uh
35:58 like
36:00 like between the time you came up an
36:01 idea and the time with security first
36:03 client so how much time uh was that
36:07 yeah unfortunately the supermarket space
36:09 is not that fast
36:10 so the sales cycle is quite long
36:12 um so we got um
36:15 we got ultimately uh our contract signed
36:18 and all with uh with our first edica
36:20 store in april
36:22 um and we
36:24 graduated from ef in um in uh january
36:28 [Music]
36:30 yeah but we're officially like
36:31 registered as a company and all from
36:33 april as well just okay also takes time
36:35 to do that
36:36 there a lot of paperwork here in germany
36:38 germany yeah
36:39 and yeah i also prepared a question
36:41 about investors um i guess you answered
36:44 that so entrepreneur first acts as an
36:46 investor there are there is a board and
36:48 then they decide whether they should
36:50 invest
36:52 is it the only investor you have
36:57 ish
37:00 so
37:01 there are things that we will announce
37:03 later but uh
37:04 at the moment officially there is only
37:06 them yeah there is we're lining up
37:09 actually angel investors at the moment
37:11 and we have
37:12 uh an amazing guy as an angel investor
37:16 which we would love to announce but
37:18 it's in the works
37:20 well you don't have to announce but
37:21 maybe you can tell us about the process
37:24 like how do you actually do so
37:26 with entrepreneur first okay they have
37:28 this committee that decide if they
37:30 invest or not but once you graduated
37:32 once you don't have this support from ef
37:35 how do you go about finding an industry
37:38 right
37:38 actually ef gives you a fundraising
37:41 manager after you graduate
37:44 and
37:45 they help you a lot with like how to
37:47 structure the narrative
37:48 how to find the investors and stuff they
37:50 also give you a platform called demo day
37:53 which is basically like a well in corona
37:55 times it's just like a web page with
37:58 some youtube videos but it used to be
38:00 that you go to a theater and there are
38:02 100 investors invited and then they will
38:04 basically like talk to you after the uh
38:07 the the talk that you give the pitch
38:10 um we decided to not go for demo day uh
38:13 interestingly because
38:14 we found that
38:16 in our specific case um you know we need
38:19 to be proven
38:21 with the numbers and the uh measures
38:24 that we get from the pilots themselves
38:26 in order to gain traction since it's
38:28 such a slow industry
38:30 and it's such a
38:32 core competency of the supermarkets so
38:36 very hard actually to sell
38:38 um
38:39 because imagine you're you're
38:41 substituting a really like core part of
38:44 the entire ordering system or of the
38:46 entire of what the supermarket does if
38:47 you think about a supermarket is
38:49 you get stuff in
38:51 and you get stuff out and you have to
38:53 present them well okay so we
38:55 fix the get stuff in
38:58 and then they have to think about
38:59 present them well and get stuff out
39:00 right so pretty hard to sell
39:03 okay
39:04 yeah so
39:06 and we want to raise on our terms later
39:07 that's also why
39:09 but having more
39:11 traction yeah so if you didn't go
39:13 through this demo day like are there
39:16 like what kind of places where people
39:18 can look for investors like are there
39:20 meetups
39:21 right um well investors approach you
39:24 actually uh usually
39:26 uh how do you do they find you like do
39:28 you
39:29 just post on linkedin hey i'm looking
39:31 for investors
39:33 i think uh just by the fact that you
39:35 have co-founder in the name
39:37 uh they they they search for you um okay
39:40 in linkedin and also i believe they may
39:43 have some bots from the andals register
39:46 um
39:47 so the the register of companies in
39:48 germany
39:50 they may
39:51 actually get scraped by them and
39:54 they know of all the companies
39:56 so they probably have a bunch of
39:57 analysts in the vc uh firm and they go
40:01 through all these companies they look it
40:02 up they see what they're doing if they
40:04 think it's good enough they will
40:06 definitely shoot an email so not that
40:08 hard to find any investor to find the
40:11 good investors it's up to you so you um
40:15 there are certain investors that um
40:18 you know you want to have uh in your
40:20 board because they have specific
40:21 expertise right so for example investors
40:24 that usually are in the foodtech
40:26 industry
40:27 are great for us
40:29 and
40:31 other investors that are like high
40:33 profile they usually like
40:35 less
40:36 hands-on more like
40:38 um
40:39 you know they they care rather than they
40:42 try to control so um these kind of
40:44 investors yeah you need to do a little
40:46 bit of the work yourself perhaps
40:48 sometimes and try to
40:49 try to approach them and stuff
40:52 yeah i'm curious so you said like there
40:54 are investors and they are good
40:55 investors
40:56 so what could be the consequences of
40:59 going with a bad investor
41:02 well um
41:04 you may get like a bad term sheet uh
41:06 where
41:07 basically um they take a lot of your
41:10 equity
41:11 for not so much money
41:14 uh you um
41:17 you may get i don't know some other
41:19 little caveats in the term sheet uh that
41:21 you may not like uh you may get like
41:24 uh people in the board that perhaps are
41:27 trying to control too much
41:29 of your company
41:31 and there's not so much a culture of
41:33 trust but is rather a culture of like uh
41:36 hey we give you the money like we want
41:38 the money back immediately kind of like
41:40 try to grow as fast as possible blah
41:41 blah which is gonna be you know
41:44 it is pretty common with investors that
41:45 they want to do that i mean it's their
41:46 job ultimately but there's some of them
41:48 they do it in a
41:49 more kind of um
41:52 empathetic nurturing
41:54 um
41:55 way that is more enjoyable for everybody
41:57 and some of them they might do it in a
41:59 more predatory way but i've we at the
42:03 moment we don't have anybody in the
42:04 board because ef gave us a convertible
42:07 note so
42:08 uh it's very it's very chill and very
42:10 quiet maybe uh avik actually if he was
42:13 my co-founder
42:14 would have more insights into this
42:16 question actually okay
42:19 yeah i understand
42:21 and uh i'm curious what
42:24 so you have pretty similar profiles even
42:26 though it's more entrepreneurial uh but
42:28 at the end you're both kind of engineers
42:31 right you yes
42:33 so how do you split so first of all what
42:35 do you do
42:36 what does he do and how do you split
42:38 these responsibilities
42:40 yeah um good question so
42:43 of course at first we wanted to do
42:44 everything together
42:45 uh but then we decided that actually
42:47 that was not gonna like really help that
42:50 much because then you have to
42:51 synchronize ideas on every single little
42:53 thing
42:53 so and i i don't think the productivity
42:56 gains are very much higher but it's good
42:58 at first i think to think about the
43:00 major
43:01 major things together and to continue to
43:03 do that all the time and then we
43:04 continue to do that every day
43:06 um
43:08 but of course right now i'm fully the
43:10 cto so i do all of the tech
43:13 uh almost all of the fact i didn't do
43:15 the mobile app um
43:18 and
43:19 he
43:20 is doing all of the sales and business
43:22 development
43:23 so all the outreach to possible clients
43:26 talking to them talking to investors
43:28 making the pitch deck
43:30 uh and i do all of the
43:32 pipelines and the
43:34 code and uh
43:36 data mongoling and the dashboards and
43:39 connections to the app and the machine
43:41 learning algorithms and experiments
43:43 they're all the engineering stuff right
43:45 all the engineering stuff yeah yeah do
43:47 you have other people in the company now
43:50 yeah we we do so uh we have a mobile
43:53 developer uh the freelancer
43:55 the operator the one who created the app
43:58 uh amazing guy uh fantastic
44:00 um unfortunately the the contract for
44:03 the freelancer ended but we hope that
44:05 maybe in the future we can we can come
44:07 back and work together
44:09 and
44:11 yeah he is um yeah he did an amazing job
44:14 we
44:17 also have a working student
44:20 which is from university of manim um
44:22 he's uh also in uh in the business side
44:25 and he helps avik with that
44:28 yeah but we're gonna start hiring
44:30 actually more people soon
44:32 um so
44:33 since uh
44:35 maybe this topic is already on your mind
44:37 about hiring
44:38 how how do you decide who to hire first
44:41 so you need it enough so you hired the
44:43 freelancer who did that up and then you
44:46 know he
44:47 went on for working for another gig but
44:50 for a permanent employee how do you
44:51 decide who to hire first
44:54 that's a good question so um
44:57 i would say it's the same thing uh for
44:59 the app or
45:00 like the department and it's a person
45:03 um
45:04 the
45:05 it's very simple uh it feels like like
45:08 when you are in the in the job you kind
45:10 of know what you need right
45:12 uh but i think the
45:14 a good principle to think about is like
45:16 don't
45:17 necessarily try to do everything
45:18 yourself if you're not an expert in it
45:20 so like feel
45:22 compelled to uh actually ask for help
45:25 and ask for help in this case means
45:27 hiring someone
45:28 so uh at first i thought oh maybe you
45:31 can also like pick up flutter and do the
45:33 app and blah blah but then honestly like
45:35 by thinking about it it would have
45:37 pushed us you know several months
45:41 back
45:42 just because i would need to
45:44 like learn a new language uh then code
45:46 the app in that language blah blah blah
45:49 uh i would probably do a worse job than
45:51 what jeremiah did so like jeremiah is
45:53 the
45:54 amazing mobile developer um
45:57 and
45:58 yeah in the end it doesn't doesn't
45:59 really make sense uh we had the
46:01 investment uh already so why not use it
46:05 and uh spare my time to do something
46:07 that i can do much better so basically
46:10 as a
46:11 founder as a co-founder one of the
46:13 things you need to
46:15 do is
46:16 know how to delegate right and know how
46:18 to let things go like not try to do
46:20 things yourself i am pretty sure you
46:22 would do an app but it would just take
46:24 more time right exactly yeah so um
46:28 asking for help
46:29 uh is a great thing uh it's uh
46:33 i know that uh if especially if you're
46:35 entrepreneurially minded you want to be
46:37 the one doing all of it but it's not
46:40 shameful at all and it actually
46:43 it is quite pretty appreciated by the
46:45 clients because they see their product
46:46 faster by the investors because they see
46:48 their money back faster
46:50 by basically everybody
46:52 and
46:53 i don't know if this is a problem you
46:55 had you have had or not
46:57 but i imagine that
46:59 you as a startup
47:01 when you need to hire people maybe the
47:04 package you can offer to candidates is
47:06 less attractive than you know big well
47:09 established companies such as zlanda or
47:11 amazon or i don't know leaks for example
47:14 so uh
47:16 how do you
47:17 manage to make this uh offer package
47:20 uh attractive have you thought about
47:22 this like how do i interact with people
47:23 to work at stanford uh we hired
47:25 internationally so we were not afraid to
47:28 go into different countries
47:30 um and um
47:32 unfortunately in in the end
47:34 our mobile dev uh
47:36 basically joined because he just loves
47:38 the technology and he wanted to do
47:40 something in in that technology he
47:43 because he used to do it in his free
47:44 time
47:45 uh and uh
47:47 he
47:48 um
47:49 he felt like you know he can at least
47:51 have some money out of it um
47:53 and so i think this is a very special
47:55 case of uh extremely passionate person
47:57 who really wanted to bring something to
47:59 the world
48:00 and maybe you know have also some fun
48:01 and some money um in that in flutter
48:04 specifically but um
48:07 i would say for
48:09 in in general like uh our offer was
48:11 attractive because for example we will
48:13 pay the same rate in all parts of the
48:15 world
48:16 so um so for example for an indian
48:19 developer that would be like an amazing
48:20 salary
48:22 okay so maybe for somebody from berlin
48:24 it will be like on a cage one but if
48:27 they go to a bigger company maybe they
48:29 would offer more but for somebody from
48:31 uh like where the average salary is not
48:34 as uh like lower than in germany and for
48:37 them
48:38 yeah i think kovid opened this amazing
48:41 possibility of reward working uh to
48:43 everybody just we just opened our eyes
48:44 and we were like oh right we can do this
48:46 so
48:47 we just kind of took advantage of that
48:49 fact
48:51 okay
48:52 yeah nice so what are your plans for the
48:53 future
48:55 great question
48:56 more clients more product more shipping
48:59 more launches
49:01 more money more investors more
49:04 more hires
49:05 uh bigger clients
49:08 and grow from there yeah and
49:11 this is kind of uh this is on of course
49:13 uh
49:14 of course the plan but i'd say um
49:18 we want to
49:19 in the long term future
49:21 uh be kind of the um the grocery food
49:25 retailer os
49:28 where it's a one-stop shop for all of
49:31 their uh logistics and supply chain
49:33 needs
49:34 and we want to also go um in
49:38 the other steps in the chain so go up to
49:41 the distribution centers the fulfillment
49:43 centers the
49:45 uh perhaps sometimes even go beyond that
49:48 and go
49:49 as much as possible towards even the
49:51 farmers and the
49:52 um
49:54 the the people with the um
49:57 the grow the cows and uh the pigs and
49:59 stuff
50:00 um because there's so much that can be
50:03 done at all these levels
50:05 to uh predict what uh kind of food needs
50:09 to
50:10 be on the on the shelves ultimately of
50:12 the supermarkets and uh we feel like we
50:15 can
50:16 have so much impact by having one
50:18 solution that would actually
50:21 kind of enable what is the uh
50:23 just-in-time supply chain of toyota
50:24 right so like when for example uh there
50:27 is um
50:29 you know i need a banana right now
50:32 because i'm hungry uh then my system
50:34 will know oh carmine it's okay it's
50:36 friday it's 6 p.m uh you know you just
50:39 had a long day once a banana so then uh
50:42 preemptively would actually predict all
50:45 of that
50:46 months in advance and the farmer will be
50:48 like okay i need to produce this many
50:50 bananas
50:51 i think amazon is doing that already i
50:53 think i sometimes feel like amazon can
50:56 read my mind because i run out of
50:58 shampoo recently i went to dubai and
51:00 then on the first page it was already
51:02 recommending me something
51:04 ah interesting but see the that's
51:06 another side which is the recommendation
51:08 side
51:09 um which is uh yeah quite similar
51:12 actually forecasting so there's a lot of
51:13 things that i learned you know alexa
51:16 come back
51:17 here in this work um
51:20 but yeah it would be much more towards
51:21 forecasting
51:23 specifically um
51:25 and with the just-in-time supply chain
51:27 uh what you have is a lot less inventory
51:29 space
51:31 uh so that means also like less needs
51:33 for huge warehouses less need for um
51:36 transportation
51:37 so also trucking and all that actually
51:40 spends a lot of
51:41 you know they burn a lot of uh fossil
51:43 fuels uh not great for the environment
51:46 so
51:47 it's not just the problem of like you
51:49 know the rotten food that has co2 that
51:52 gets released to the planet
51:53 there's a lot going on actually in the
51:55 supply chain that can be fixed by having
51:58 by ordering the exact amount now the
52:01 exact amount is really really hard
52:03 because if you order too much you're
52:04 producing just waste
52:07 and the retailers try to
52:09 do that because they don't like to have
52:11 their shelves empty
52:13 that's really bad that means that
52:14 they're losing customers uh you know the
52:17 customers will go to another store if
52:19 their shelves are empty and with fresh
52:22 products specifically you have all of
52:24 them in boxes right so if you have let's
52:26 say the last bananas or the last two
52:28 bananas
52:29 it's basically like the shelf is empty
52:31 because the last two bananas nobody
52:33 picks them up
52:36 yeah i know
52:37 i wouldn't
52:39 exactly you think something is wrong
52:41 with them exactly
52:43 exactly so
52:45 given consumer behavior and um these
52:48 other factors they need to keep stocking
52:50 the shelves
52:52 but then it's really really hard to
52:53 stock them exactly that they look kind
52:56 of full even at the end of the day but
52:58 yet in the back room there is nothing
53:01 and what we found is that that's not the
53:02 case obviously because it's really
53:04 really tough so we try to to fix that
53:06 problem
53:08 interesting
53:09 would you do anything differently now
53:11 like if you were starting the game yes
53:15 i would not use open source
53:17 infrastructure i would directly use gcp
53:20 that was
53:20 [Laughter]
53:23 we switched from
53:25 from an open source ml ops
53:27 infrastructure that you may know what it
53:29 is it's called kubeflow
53:32 it was giving us it was fantastic when
53:35 it worked to be honest but then we
53:38 we
53:39 upgraded to i think 1.3 and it started
53:42 breaking in different ways and 1.2 also
53:45 gave us a lot of troubles um
53:47 with um
53:48 with the installation and stuff and i
53:51 spent
53:52 i think like just one month
53:54 or one and a half months
53:56 just
53:57 just
53:58 taking care of kubeflow
54:02 which i think for a startup is not a
54:03 great idea uh so
54:05 at the end i just said okay
54:08 fine we're in gcp we use the gcp stuff
54:10 and uh so glad that we went for gcp also
54:13 uh much
54:14 better interfaces and uh
54:17 and software that we're used to in in
54:19 aws
54:21 we're using bigquery
54:23 cloud run cloud functions event arc it's
54:26 an event-driven architecture so
54:28 everything that comes in gets pushed
54:29 around in these pipelines
54:32 we use firestore for the
54:34 for the app api
54:36 which is lightning fast uh it's it's
54:38 beautiful uh and it just works
54:41 yeah i guess uh one advice that you
54:43 would uh one piece uh you would give to
54:47 um somebody who started a startup so go
54:49 with a managed solution right yeah go
54:51 with a managed solution instead of uh
54:53 instead of a
54:54 open source solution at least at first
54:57 okay and um the good thing is that for a
55:00 startup uh the
55:02 uh the folks at google and the folks at
55:04 aws if you are in a cred if if you're
55:08 invested by an accredited investor of
55:10 them
55:11 um they will actually give you some
55:13 credits
55:14 so we received 100k
55:16 in credits uh from google uh so that
55:19 that means that we can
55:21 we can you know use their most expensive
55:23 solutions uh and and yet not like sleep
55:26 well at night
55:28 yeah so basically they bet on you that
55:30 uh you know you will grow that's why
55:32 they invest
55:33 100k in their services that's that's
55:36 very nice of them yeah yeah and at the
55:38 end if you really like their services so
55:40 you will you will continue yeah exactly
55:44 yeah so this this is i think one of the
55:47 things that in the tech space
55:50 yeah we could have done differently do
55:51 you have any other advice for people who
55:54 would like to start building a startup
55:56 now
55:57 um
55:58 wow
56:00 where do we start um
56:02 i would say that uh it's
56:06 it's gonna be okay everybody says the
56:08 same uh that it's gonna be hard and
56:09 you're gonna have tough times uh and it
56:12 is true
56:14 and just be prepared and uh be just um
56:18 very
56:19 um
56:20 yeah emotionally uh intelligent that uh
56:24 um
56:25 you know sometimes let's say a sales
56:27 calls doesn't go well
56:28 uh it may not be you okay so it's not
56:31 don't it's not personal it's not a
56:32 personal thing it is rather like perhaps
56:35 that uh you could
56:38 um i don't know not talk about the
56:40 specifics of your solution there's no
56:42 need sometimes you can say it's just ib
56:45 there is perhaps like another concern
56:47 that you cannot address at the moment
56:49 because you're just too small and you
56:51 don't know certain things right so
56:54 the struggle at first
56:55 is basically a mismatch between the fact
56:58 that you want to have the best clients
57:00 in order to have the best contracts in
57:02 order to have the best uh
57:04 investors in order to be able to hire
57:06 the best people et cetera et cetera but
57:08 you're not there yet and so you're
57:10 always like trying to get to that point
57:14 and it is really really hard to
57:16 cope with all that load that you put on
57:18 yourself uh so be mindful of that and
57:23 i would say
57:24 find a co-founder that is
57:27 on the same page as you
57:28 uh that you can communicate really well
57:30 with
57:31 uh and not necessarily
57:35 you know it doesn't have to be the best
57:36 salesperson in the world if he's on the
57:38 business side or he doesn't have to be
57:40 the best
57:41 technical person in the world although
57:43 it kind of helps but
57:44 uh it only helps up to a certain
57:46 percentage um
57:49 so there was actually like a
57:50 presentation that my girlfriend did
57:51 she's a recruiter
57:53 that says that uh you should hire a
57:55 listened behavioral interview you should
57:57 hire for um 10 skills
58:01 at least
58:02 okay so the framework is uh how much uh
58:05 skills and
58:09 competency so like behaviors
58:12 and how much
58:15 motivation actually plays out in
58:18 the
58:19 final performance of employees so skills
58:21 is about 10 to 20
58:23 and then the rest is motivation and
58:25 behavior so like try to get people try
58:28 to hire people for motivation and
58:29 behavior
58:31 and if you get motivation behavior
58:33 skills you're just golden
58:35 but with your co-founder you're going to
58:36 speak every day and if he's motivated
58:38 enough he's going to figure it out
58:41 he's if his behavior is great also he's
58:44 going to figure it out so that's another
58:46 advice try to get these kind of people
58:48 don't fix too much on skills yeah thanks
58:50 do you have like five ten more minutes
58:53 sorry advice we have a lot of questions
58:55 and uh sure happy training okay
58:57 uh some of them
58:59 so the first question is about books
59:01 that you mentioned i think it was design
59:02 thinking than the mom tests right that's
59:05 right uh i'll just put them in the
59:07 description after we finish that talk
59:11 then the second question from ali is
59:13 about how
59:14 do you get
59:16 continuous motivation to to do this
59:18 stuff uh coming from you know a software
59:22 engineering kind of background uh how do
59:24 you do this i guess in a startup
59:26 when things
59:28 don't work as well you said you need to
59:30 think about like it maybe it's not you
59:32 right it's them but like how do you get
59:34 this continuous motivation how have you
59:36 managed to keep
59:38 doing this it's kind of in you uh so
59:42 i don't know if there is a
59:44 way to get motivation uh
59:46 like for me for example i really care
59:49 about uh like climate change and the
59:52 food waste problem uh it seems to be
59:55 the
59:56 kind of the underdog of the climate
59:58 change spectrum of problems right it's
1:00:00 it's actually right there it's in front
1:00:02 of us
1:00:03 uh and it is
1:00:04 massive like again like that's six times
1:00:08 the number of uh
1:00:09 uh co2 emissions then the aviation
1:00:12 industry is a massive number if you
1:00:13 think about it differently it is
1:00:16 if you
1:00:17 think about food waste as a country in
1:00:20 terms of carbon emission it would be the
1:00:22 third country in the world
1:00:24 so after u.s and china
1:00:27 there will be food waste and then there
1:00:28 will be india with half
1:00:30 of the carbon emission of food waste
1:00:33 which is uh
1:00:34 that's that's just insane it seems like
1:00:36 we have to do this
1:00:37 uh and it seems like also the
1:00:40 opportunity space is pretty big like the
1:00:43 food retail industry is
1:00:46 is now just now like
1:00:48 in this process of digitalization and
1:00:51 the opportunity for
1:00:53 you know companies like ours is just
1:00:55 it's just great
1:00:57 and then yeah you work with the right
1:00:58 people
1:01:00 and i guess
1:01:01 that that's what you need but i guess
1:01:03 motivation comes from the inside what
1:01:05 you care about
1:01:07 thank you
1:01:08 so there is a question from isaac is uh
1:01:11 i am 30 years old i want to be a cto in
1:01:13 a startup
1:01:14 uh launching my own with a ceo i guess
1:01:17 very similar to what he did
1:01:19 so his main focus is machine learning
1:01:22 and he knows little about front-end
1:01:24 development devops and
1:01:26 all these things
1:01:28 so the question is do you think it's
1:01:30 enough to start the cto or
1:01:33 or not
1:01:34 um it could be it could be getting tough
1:01:37 sometimes i guess
1:01:39 but honestly if you use like a managed
1:01:41 solution and you can spend some time
1:01:44 like figuring out
1:01:45 like new
1:01:46 concepts um i don't think it's a problem
1:01:49 that you have only like the machine
1:01:50 learning background again like what i
1:01:52 said before
1:01:54 the framework that they used in my
1:01:56 girlfriend's company uh 10 to 20 skill
1:01:59 uh 50 motivation and then the rest is
1:02:03 behavior
1:02:04 do you think um he should learn
1:02:06 something now before becoming a founder
1:02:08 or yeah sure yeah much better now
1:02:11 because then you have pressures from
1:02:12 investors from clients from your
1:02:14 co-founder
1:02:15 your hires so like please
1:02:18 start as soon as possible but then you
1:02:20 will never start like you will always
1:02:22 think okay i'm not ready yet i need to
1:02:23 learn this thing like there is this new
1:02:25 framework that you need to learn and
1:02:27 there is this new book that everyone
1:02:29 says it's good then like how do you know
1:02:31 that you're ready
1:02:33 uh you don't
1:02:34 but uh
1:02:36 you will always will never feel ready to
1:02:38 be honest like even uh honestly i have
1:02:40 more than 10 years of experience in
1:02:42 software engineering and yet like
1:02:44 i didn't think i was ready for a startup
1:02:47 until i joined the f and i was like wait
1:02:49 a second i'm actually not that bad i can
1:02:51 actually do this
1:02:53 so um
1:02:54 like you can also just jump in and
1:02:56 figure it out on the spot
1:02:58 absolutely
1:03:00 i would say maybe uh if you for example
1:03:02 go for entrepreneur first um
1:03:05 if you get in uh like start as early as
1:03:07 possible
1:03:09 um and start as early as possible doing
1:03:12 um maybe not necessarily technical stuff
1:03:15 but um
1:03:16 even just like figuring out the problem
1:03:19 space and stuff like that like start
1:03:21 doing something if you if you can
1:03:23 but um
1:03:25 don't be afraid of also just jumping in
1:03:27 actually you think that just jumping in
1:03:29 will propel you to know these things by
1:03:32 itself it's a bit of a balance i know
1:03:34 it's i know this answer sucks because i
1:03:37 it's
1:03:38 what is it exactly that you're trying to
1:03:39 recommend but uh either works if you
1:03:42 have enough motivation i would say
1:03:44 and
1:03:45 what do you think about the importance
1:03:46 of a business school
1:03:49 um
1:03:50 not important whatsoever
1:03:52 okay okay so yeah
1:03:54 without going
1:03:56 to a business school without an mba
1:03:58 right yeah uh so the
1:04:01 the thing about mbas from what i learned
1:04:03 from other friends of the mbas even at
1:04:05 uh big mba firms like insaad etc like
1:04:09 you don't need one for a startup
1:04:12 and
1:04:13 what they teach you there are concepts
1:04:15 for running like large-scale businesses
1:04:17 you know
1:04:19 in a startup you have such a specific
1:04:21 set of challenges that are specific to
1:04:23 your markets and
1:04:24 and all and um
1:04:26 don't need to have like
1:04:28 you know these grand scheme of things uh
1:04:30 kind of overviews or you know how to do
1:04:33 like
1:04:34 a specific
1:04:35 business uh case or a specific thing in
1:04:38 a very structured way is much more like
1:04:41 um ship it as soon as possible that's
1:04:44 what you want to do
1:04:45 okay yeah so it's more about the mindset
1:04:48 right yeah
1:04:49 absolutely i think there is a book
1:04:51 called ship it i think it's about that
1:04:53 there must be at least one
1:04:55 i think it's this is how it's called
1:04:56 shipment yeah i think i heard about it
1:05:00 yeah i haven't said that but uh i
1:05:02 imagine it's good
1:05:03 yeah
1:05:04 okay uh oh we have another question so
1:05:06 what happens if you don't find a
1:05:08 co-founder at ef
1:05:10 well you're out also yeah
1:05:13 yeah um so you
1:05:15 have to have a co-founder you have to
1:05:17 have a co-founder when you are in the in
1:05:19 the forum phase so they give you these
1:05:20 eight weeks just uh
1:05:22 use them correctly try to
1:05:24 uh if you go for ef um like try to get
1:05:28 into a team as soon as possible don't
1:05:30 like waste your time thinking is this
1:05:32 the right person is this not is am i
1:05:35 blah blah like
1:05:38 figure it out like if let's say get some
1:05:40 answers of course don't get to with the
1:05:43 first person that you meet but
1:05:44 um
1:05:46 if you vibe enough just go for it
1:05:49 that's kind of the startup mentality
1:05:50 just just go for it
1:05:52 and another
1:05:54 another question that we just got is
1:05:57 would you recommend to start
1:05:59 with ef if you already have a pretty
1:06:02 clear idea i think you just said just go
1:06:04 for it would you answer
1:06:06 that as well
1:06:07 um
1:06:09 i would actually start with the f even
1:06:11 though you have a pre-existing idea
1:06:13 i also had a pre-existing idea which is
1:06:15 i i actually tried it in the first
1:06:18 few weeks ovf with another team right
1:06:22 and
1:06:23 we also figured out that the market may
1:06:26 have not been exactly ready or
1:06:29 the best kind of market for for that
1:06:31 kind of idea
1:06:32 okay um so
1:06:34 being in ef will also like teach you
1:06:37 uh how things work in the real world
1:06:40 because sometimes before
1:06:42 you you're stuck in your own uh bubble
1:06:44 right so for example when we're working
1:06:46 olx you know we may know a lot about
1:06:48 marketplaces and about data science but
1:06:51 not about like uh you know the all the
1:06:53 business side
1:06:54 uh in of things in general how uh
1:06:57 investors think about who to invest in
1:06:59 et cetera et cetera so
1:07:01 it will give you that kind of mentality
1:07:04 okay we have another question and that
1:07:06 will be the last one so
1:07:08 did you already have a prototype before
1:07:10 your pitch
1:07:13 no we had uh like a demo
1:07:16 of um
1:07:18 so for the for the first pitch so for
1:07:20 the super check-in we had a demo of the
1:07:22 computer vision
1:07:24 uh recognition of uh rapness
1:07:27 on bananas only and it was web-based
1:07:31 so it works with tensorflow.js
1:07:33 but then for the forecasting solution no
1:07:36 we didn't have a demo
1:07:38 okay so you just basically need to be
1:07:40 able to pitch this idea and have this
1:07:42 idea very clear right so that the
1:07:43 investors can already imagine
1:07:45 uh
1:07:47 like
1:07:48 what are you going to solve right
1:07:50 yeah they so they want to see like
1:07:52 that the market is big enough
1:07:55 and that you can you're the right people
1:07:57 for the job
1:07:59 um
1:08:00 and that
1:08:01 the
1:08:05 yeah you can find clients and uh
1:08:08 they they usually trust you on the tech
1:08:09 side
1:08:11 if you have the credentials for it right
1:08:13 so they look
1:08:14 rather your cv they're not gonna make a
1:08:16 technical interview
1:08:17 okay that's good so you can maybe
1:08:20 put a few things more
1:08:23 no that's bad advice
1:08:24 so maybe last one uh how do people find
1:08:27 you
1:08:28 oh sure uh so i'm on twitter at paulino
