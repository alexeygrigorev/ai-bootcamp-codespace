1:21 yes Dania so it's good right because I I
1:25 was not sure about the Hat
1:28 okay
1:34 so this week we will talk about
1:36 diversity and leadership in data science
1:39 and Ai and we have a special guest today
1:41 Danielle Dania is a co-founder and
1:43 director at the AI Guild where she works
1:46 with companies scaling data analytics
1:48 and machine learning she has been a
1:50 senior expert and mathematician in the
1:52 field since 2012 doing machine learning
1:54 for Predictive Analytics and focusing on
1:56 marketing use cases
1:58 so welcome to today's interview Dana
2:01 thank you thank you very much Alexi for
2:03 inviting me I as you mentioned have
2:05 known you for some time and it's the
2:08 first time that I am on your channel so
2:10 it's pretty cool yeah
2:12 I've been on your channel for like a
2:14 couple of times at least two I think
2:16 right
2:17 so yeah it's been uh it was about time I
2:21 returned the favor it should have been
2:23 long time ago so it took so long so the
2:27 questions for today's interview were
2:28 prepared by Johanna Bayer thanks Johanna
2:30 for your help and let's start so before
2:32 we go into our main topic of adoption of
2:35 AI and about diversity let's start with
2:38 your background can you tell us about
2:40 your career Journey so far
2:43 yes so I studied applied Maths for my
2:47 bachelor and when I finished it my
2:49 studies I move it from my hometown to
2:51 Rio De Janeiro so this is all back in
2:53 Brazil where I was born and I worked
2:57 three years as a marketing analyst and
3:00 also I was doing at the same time a
3:02 master's in computer science
3:04 so when I finished my Master's this was
3:08 2015. I did thesis in recommendation
3:12 systems motivated by the use cases I saw
3:15 in marketing with personalization and
3:18 also because at the time there was this
3:20 big data processing framework called
3:23 spark maybe you know it it was at the
3:26 time spark 1.0 replacing Hadoop so I
3:29 basically wrote The Thesis comparing the
3:31 implementation with spark and Hadoop
3:34 sometimes then yeah then at this point I
3:38 was uh finishing my masters I was
3:40 thinking about working abroad and it
3:44 happened that by chance I got approached
3:45 via LinkedIn for a job as a data
3:47 scientist in Berlin
3:49 so it was a perfect match they were
3:51 looking for someone with my experience
3:53 exactly so working with data and
3:56 predictive modeling for customer
3:57 Behavior Analysis
3:59 so they offered me the job they
4:01 sponsored my my Visa and then in
4:03 September 2015 I moved to Berlin
4:06 so the first three years working in
4:09 Berlin I was in fast-based environments
4:12 International environments and startups
4:14 also with smaller data teams so that
4:18 meant that even though my official job
4:20 title was data scientist I did a big
4:24 range of different tasks so I did like
4:26 data engineering jobs connecting to my
4:28 previous knowledge with spark but I also
4:31 worked on analysis and I built Tableau
4:34 dashboards and for sure I did a lot of
4:38 machine learning mostly for forecasting
4:40 and prediction paths
4:42 so it was a great time to learn all
4:45 those different skills you know I think
4:46 that helped me build a good foundation
4:49 to the end-to-end data science work and
4:52 also it was good for me to understand
4:54 what were my strengths
4:56 so I enjoyed a lot of this and
5:00 um at the time also because I just
5:02 didn't plan to move to Berlin
5:04 specifically I was dealing with like
5:06 this personal change challenges like
5:08 learning German and understanding how
5:10 life works here in Germany but yeah it
5:14 was all about discoveries I would say
5:16 the beginning of my career
5:18 foreign
5:24 title because when I started my career
5:27 two like data scientists meant many
5:30 different things so I also got to do
5:32 analytics data engineering obviously but
5:36 now yeah it's more focused I guess right
5:39 so maybe in startups data scientists
5:41 might still do like all these things but
5:43 I think in bigger companies like we have
5:45 machine learning Engineers we have data
5:47 Engineers we have data scientists who
5:49 have data on this and
5:51 um
5:51 yeah I think it's more focused right now
5:53 so it's harder to be a bit harder to be
5:56 a generalist right now yes I I agree I
6:00 think that at the beginning it was
6:02 easier to be a generalist also because
6:04 there were not so many tools like we
6:06 have now so now with the tools it's
6:10 easier to get started in a specific area
6:13 like data engineering for example and
6:15 then from there really develop your
6:17 expertise and be deep into the
6:21 areas of engineering instead of going to
6:23 deep learning for example would be very
6:25 different with different tools
6:28 okay so you work the startups and then
6:30 you did something else right
6:32 yes so I yes I then I started to
6:36 understand what I wanted to do and I
6:38 wanted really to focus on machine
6:39 learning uh also giving my background in
6:42 applied math I really enjoyed the
6:43 modeling aspect so I moved to work in
6:47 like a German company that was more
6:50 structured but then I also helped a lot
6:53 of the
6:54 definition of the roles and also I think
6:56 this is one of the things I saw during
6:58 my career in the past years like the
7:00 evolution of the field also translated
7:03 in somehow the evolution of my own
7:05 personal career and what I could
7:07 contribute to the organizations I was
7:09 working for
7:10 to come up with those like better
7:13 defined roles understand what were the
7:15 tools that the field was starting to use
7:18 and make it as standard like for example
7:21 now we see that there are consolidation
7:23 of using Cloud tools and even for
7:25 deployment we see uh that there is a lot
7:28 of companies using the same tools like
7:30 Docker kubernetes so this kind of thing
7:33 started to come up as I change it to
7:35 another job and then we started
7:37 implemented this so yes my cat is
7:40 joining us
7:42 yeah so I think that this was the time
7:45 that I also started learning that I
7:47 enjoyed a lot of teaching
7:50 because I was supporting my junior
7:52 colleagues growing to the roles and to
7:55 understand what were the Scopes of the
7:57 projects and how we could split the
7:59 tasks based on the strengths of each one
8:02 in the team and I was also thinking at a
8:05 data science boot camp at the time so I
8:07 did this
8:08 um besides my full-time job and also I
8:11 did some volunteer work at data science
8:14 for good Berlin which also helped me to
8:17 get to know other people working in data
8:19 science to exchange
8:22 um like work practices and really
8:24 understand where things were developing
8:27 too
8:28 he said he worked at a boot camp as an
8:30 instructor yes exactly because I wasn't
8:34 sure if you said well I know your
8:36 profile in LinkedIn and I remember that
8:38 you were an extracted I just didn't uh
8:40 here this time if you were an instructor
8:43 or a student was it first like you
8:45 started as a student and then became an
8:46 instructor or immediately no I was just
8:49 an instructor and I I did mainly a SQL
8:53 crash course for weekends and I did it
8:57 for two years and a half I also
8:59 supported with other classes like git or
9:02 batch scripts but yeah the main one that
9:06 I was teaching was always SQL because
9:08 it's also the first thing I learned in
9:10 my first job as soon as I graduated you
9:12 know as a marketing analyst
9:14 um the job would basically get data from
9:16 SQL and build reports or build analysis
9:19 or do simple regressions and I felt like
9:22 this was not
9:24 um at all covered like in courses in
9:26 universities now you have a lot of
9:28 online courses but back in 2012 for
9:31 Sarah was not a thing yet
9:33 but even on Coursera like I think
9:36 Corsair started but like I don't
9:37 remember any with SQL courses I think
9:40 now there are but back to any age I
9:43 think you learn on the job
9:44 and you also mentioned git and bar
9:46 scripting I think this is what many new
9:49 data scientists struggle with right
9:50 until we're helping them with these
9:52 things yeah I think those are like
9:54 things you learn on the job
9:56 and um you could be prepared you know so
10:00 I also learned those on the job like
10:02 when I started
10:04 um as an analyst I didn't work with
10:06 developers but as soon as they started
10:07 working as a data scientist I worked a
10:09 lot with back-end developers and they
10:12 were writing like proper code and they
10:14 were doing like this code reviews and I
10:18 was like okay I never did this before so
10:21 even when I was at University I learned
10:23 how to do all of that like in theory but
10:25 you work on your Seasons basically on
10:27 your own and maybe your professor is
10:28 like checking on yourself but it's not
10:31 like when you're doing collaborative
10:32 work with a team that everyone is
10:34 developing like in the same base code
10:36 you know so I learned the importance of
10:39 that
10:40 um because also I had a lot that I had
10:43 very good colleagues that had a lot of
10:45 patience with me so I picked up the
10:47 skills and then as soon as I saw the
10:50 importance of it I was like okay then we
10:51 need to spread this knowledge maybe it's
10:53 not in people's heads even the awareness
10:56 that this is important apartment and it
10:58 kind of helps you be faster and it helps
11:00 you also adapt to the new workplace if
11:03 you already know the tools that they're
11:04 using and those are quite standard tools
11:06 so you know
11:08 I want to ask you about the AI Guild but
11:11 I'm wondering if we are missing anything
11:12 before you know you started that so
11:15 probably
11:16 yeah I think we have a good link because
11:20 that's when I was doing data science for
11:23 social good and when I was taking at the
11:25 boot camp it was when I started to get
11:28 to know more people working in the field
11:29 and I started learning that
11:32 um all the challenges that I had in my
11:34 work was not only me it was not only my
11:37 company there were some common struggles
11:40 you know that we shared
11:42 um one easy or very straightforward
11:44 thing is that they're not a lot of women
11:46 in the field you know I didn't know a
11:48 lot of women uh I had a few colleagues
11:50 but then
11:52 I had this question like can I find more
11:55 women working in the field where are
11:56 they
11:58 um let's reach out to other networks see
12:01 if we can learn how to support one
12:03 another support more women entering the
12:05 field so all of this kind of started
12:09 um started
12:10 this community or this network idea so
12:14 we just like got together for example
12:16 when we started with the women group we
12:18 started getting together in a company
12:20 where one of us worked and we had
12:22 sessions just like talking about our
12:24 stories and what it is like to be a
12:27 woman in your company or what kind of
12:29 chips can you share you know
12:32 and then fast forward to 2018 is when we
12:36 really broadened the circle and we found
12:39 more people that wanted to work towards
12:41 the same goal so to really Embrace this
12:44 aspect of gender diversity at this point
12:48 um and then we started them talking
12:49 about other challenges that were
12:52 challenges in data science work for
12:56 example we want to have more impact on
12:57 business
12:59 there were many instances that we shared
13:02 projects um like proof of Concepts but
13:06 they would not be used they would not
13:08 get deployed there were many aspects
13:10 involving all of this and the more that
13:13 we shared about those challenges and we
13:15 started also learning from each other's
13:17 uh failures and learning also what we
13:20 could do
13:22 um yeah then we started doing this as an
13:26 official community so we did monthly
13:29 dinners initially in Berlin
13:31 and we were maybe like 20 30 people
13:34 getting together but we did it in uh
13:37 frequent ways so we would really meet
13:39 the same people every month
13:41 um invite new people to join and we also
13:45 started to understand that this came
13:48 together as a support not only for the
13:50 technical challenges but also as a
13:52 career support
13:53 so we kind of translated into this
13:55 question of okay do we have different
13:57 career paths or how do we grow in our
14:01 own career and yeah the idea of the AIG
14:05 Community was to put people together to
14:09 find solutions for those challenges and
14:12 my point I think was to create an
14:14 environment that was welcoming that
14:17 allowed us to talk about our experiences
14:20 because I didn't have a solution or I
14:22 don't have a solution yet but I think
14:25 that if we put our mind together and
14:27 discuss the topics we can move forward
14:29 no so really about like helping each
14:32 other and helping our at least our
14:34 ecosystem around here to grow and yeah
14:38 we launched officially the AI Guild in
14:41 May 2019 we created a logo we launched a
14:45 website and until now our mission is
14:49 really to advance AI adoption so that's
14:51 the point we want to talk our good
14:54 experiences but also about our bad
14:56 experiences people know that it's the
14:59 states that they can ask questions they
15:00 can seek for help because other people
15:03 in the community have been to similar
15:05 things and then we learn from each other
15:07 we grow together and we hope that by
15:10 like sharing the lessons learned it's
15:12 also a way to Fast Track you know other
15:15 people's careers yeah
15:17 you still have these dinners right
15:19 yes every month yes so we started with
15:23 the dinners and then we had kovid we
15:25 went to online meetings but then since
15:27 last summer we went back to the dinners
15:31 in person and now we have grown uh
15:33 outside Berlin I mean we are a global
15:35 Community we have over 2 000 people but
15:38 mostly based in Europe
15:40 and then it's upon in uh member in their
15:44 City to organize the dinner and for
15:47 example here in Berlin I am one of the
15:49 co-organizers we get together with this
15:53 idea of really networking and getting to
15:55 know each other and meeting again month
15:58 by month so we'll kind of gain Trust of
16:01 the other people that you need
16:03 cool so I know that I was on one of your
16:06 events it was like during covet times
16:08 when we got to know each other
16:11 um it was I think exactly this uh
16:14 talking about good and bad experience
16:17 and especially you mentioned the link
16:18 between a puc and deployment I think
16:21 this is one this was one of the topics
16:23 that we discussed back then so you do
16:26 that then you mention another thing so
16:28 you're also doing career sessions right
16:30 so you talk uh
16:33 about career challenges I don't get in
16:35 like going from Academia to Industry
16:38 right that's one of the things you cover
16:40 then I also know you did a conference
16:44 last year right yes yeah so there's a
16:47 lot going on yes so the monthly dinners
16:49 is how we started and we always had the
16:52 idea to get people together in a bigger
16:55 group so we have the local dinners right
16:57 but what about uh one big event that
16:59 everyone travels to Berlin which is
17:02 where we started and get to know each
17:04 other so we finally managed to do it for
17:08 the first time last June it was it is
17:10 the data lift Summit and it was
17:13 um really
17:14 to me at least it was a big surprise so
17:18 at the same time that we wanted to do it
17:20 since we started in 2019
17:22 um you were not sure like how is this
17:24 going to work especially like fresh was
17:26 copied online events became the normal
17:29 and it was comfortable and you get to
17:32 know people from doing this kind of
17:34 calls online or watching them on YouTube
17:36 never met in person yet
17:39 we were yeah we were like two people
17:42 really want to meet in person I don't
17:43 know maybe we are still a bit afraid
17:45 like people are still getting starting
17:48 to get the shots for the uh the
17:50 protection of everyone we were like okay
17:52 let's do it in summer because then we
17:55 can do it in more Open Spaces maybe it's
17:57 safer and maybe by then more people get
18:00 access to the vaccine
18:01 and yeah we sold out we had 300 tickets
18:04 we sold out all the tickets
18:06 um it was really amazing to see how the
18:09 community was looking forward to be
18:11 together in the same space and meet like
18:14 face to face you know and it was
18:17 um a huge learning for me how to
18:18 organize this I had never done anything
18:21 in person but I really had an easy time
18:24 let's say to find a speaker because our
18:25 community people really want to share
18:28 what they have been through their
18:29 knowledge and this was the easy part so
18:32 the speakers was the easiest part I had
18:35 more than 50 speakers and then
18:38 um we were not sure if people would want
18:40 to join for the event but especially
18:43 after uh or the two months before the
18:45 event we were able to sell all the
18:47 tickets and it was a really nice
18:50 get-together like cool atmosphere for
18:53 people that were both entering the field
18:55 but over 40 percent of our audience are
18:58 people in the mid-level of their careers
19:01 so they are between years two and three
19:03 and you would also have a lot of people
19:06 in the community that are over five
19:08 years of experience maybe they are even
19:10 uh founders of their own startups so
19:13 there was a good met uh match for people
19:16 that wanted to like get career advice
19:18 and people that maybe were looking to
19:21 expand their team you know yeah
19:23 you're doing this are you doing this the
19:26 summit this year yes we are doing it
19:29 again this year in Berlin in June and
19:33 now I can do a plug we still have uh
19:36 call for speakers open until the end of
19:38 this month so end of February so yeah if
19:41 somebody wants to speak hurry up
19:43 yes you should also take a look yeah
19:46 exactly you are also invited to now
19:48 present live in person
19:50 okay cool okay and I want to
19:54 um go a little bit back to the time when
19:56 you said that uh you noticed that uh
19:59 like there are not a lot of women in the
20:01 field and uh you wanted to reach out to
20:04 more women and you started organizing
20:08 um meetups in one of the companies where
20:11 you worked and you had sessions where
20:13 you talked about different challenges so
20:16 I wanted to ask you what did you discuss
20:19 on this challenges what were the topics
20:21 how did you come up with these topics
20:23 yes so
20:26 this is something that started as my own
20:30 curiosity so I was kind of selfish you
20:33 know I wanted to find answers for myself
20:35 in my career and this is I think what
20:39 everyone does maybe not intentionally
20:41 but you look up to other people right
20:43 you see what they have done and you
20:45 think okay could I do the same if I want
20:47 to be where this person is
20:49 and I couldn't really find a woman that
20:53 was in the successful Institute of data
20:55 science around here in Berlin so it was
20:58 not easy to find and because if I could
21:00 see this person I would go them there
21:03 and ask them you know how did you do
21:04 this or I'm going through this do you
21:07 have any chips so that was the first
21:09 thing that motivated me today how can I
21:11 do it for myself
21:13 um I didn't really find someone
21:15 specifically but I found a lot of other
21:17 women that were also around here and
21:20 they had different experiences so for
21:22 example I was working as a full-time
21:24 data scientist but there were people
21:26 that were doing teaching people that
21:28 were volunteering so that's also what I
21:31 started to understand that you could do
21:33 besides your full-time job there were
21:35 other there were Freelancers there were
21:37 others that were founders so the first
21:41 event that we did was really uh career
21:44 options so that was the title like
21:45 career options and I put together a
21:48 panel that I was the interviewer so I I
21:51 had my own questions right so I created
21:53 an event to ask them my own questions
21:55 about the careers that they chose and
21:58 really to talk about like what is it
22:00 that you do and why do you think that
22:02 you chose this career so we had someone
22:04 doing research someone doing freelance
22:06 someone working full-time as team lead
22:09 and it was really about no tell us what
22:12 you do and why you chose this career and
22:16 what can you tell others like maybe pros
22:19 and cons of choosing this career and it
22:21 became a discussion and from that we
22:24 from that first one we learned that
22:27 there were a lot of other things that
22:29 people wanted to know so we decided okay
22:32 let's have a list of different topics
22:35 and then each month we can do one of
22:37 those topics but yeah that's how it
22:39 started I really wanted answers for
22:41 myself yeah that's it's a very nice way
22:45 to find answers right you organize a
22:46 panel and then you find people who have
22:50 answers and you ask them
22:52 and yeah yeah and then really happy you
22:56 know to like do this for other women
22:58 because yeah we don't see so many women
23:01 in like maybe you know one or two and
23:03 then another person another one or two
23:05 so with that we got to 30 you know that
23:08 was pretty cool
23:10 they think the situation is better now
23:12 in Berlin in terms of gender diversity
23:15 yes I do so
23:17 um I think my last full-time job we had
23:20 a team that was 50 50 we had the same
23:22 amount of men and women for example but
23:25 yeah I have been to job interviews in
23:27 which I got only interviewed by men and
23:30 I don't know it feels different you know
23:33 and I don't think it's only gender
23:34 diversity I mean this is the main point
23:36 I think it's easy to see but um what I
23:40 think is also unique here in Berlin is
23:42 the internationality so we have people
23:45 from like different countries that live
23:47 here together and especially in startups
23:50 people come to Berlin to work here and
23:52 like the language is English but you can
23:55 hear like people maybe speaking Spanish
23:57 in one corner people speaking Russian in
23:59 another corner and we are all here you
24:01 know so I think this creates a very
24:04 welcoming environment that you don't
24:06 feel like you're the outsider like
24:07 everyone is an outsider so we're all
24:09 together in the same boat
24:11 that's a beautiful Berlin yeah you can
24:14 feel at home even though it's
24:15 technically not your homes
24:17 yeah
24:19 and uh yeah but I guess one thing is
24:22 like you said situation improved and you
24:24 had 50 50
24:26 um gender diversity like 50 50 gender
24:28 representation and one of your last
24:30 companies but maybe because this is how
24:32 you chose companies
24:34 could it be the case yes so as I
24:39 mentioned I had been to interviews in
24:41 which I only had like male people
24:43 interviewing me even there was one that
24:46 was really strange so this was back in
24:48 the time that you had to go to the
24:49 company to interview and all the people
24:52 that I saw there were non-female and I
24:56 was like don't I mean do they even have
24:59 like um women's
25:01 bathroom because there's only guys here
25:03 you know but yeah um I think this has to
25:06 do not only with
25:09 um the company that I chose but also
25:11 maybe how the company positions
25:12 themselves and the type of
25:15 um maybe this is independent of your
25:17 gender of your background or your
25:19 nationality but also the um culture or
25:23 like the work environment the atmosphere
25:24 itself that could be more welcoming to
25:27 people that have different ways of
25:29 thinking you know like diversity is also
25:31 in this way for data science we have
25:34 diversity of backgrounds like people
25:36 that study I don't know economics or
25:38 computer science or psychology can be
25:40 working as data scientists but also yeah
25:43 different ways of thinking
25:46 so diversity here means many things
25:49 gender diversity is only one visible
25:52 aspect right but there are also diverse
25:55 in nationality diversity we all come
25:57 from different uh places in the world
26:00 and then also background diversity so
26:02 some people come from I don't know
26:03 physics mathematics some people come
26:06 from computer science some people come
26:07 from uh economics some people come from
26:10 I don't know social sciences and this is
26:13 another aspect of diversity are there
26:15 other aspects on this I guess the main
26:18 ones right
26:19 yeah I think those are the main ones
26:21 there are other aspects like neural
26:23 diversity but yeah those are more
26:28 specific topics or even more difficult
26:30 to address yeah what is that
26:33 neurodiversity is for people that are
26:36 different in ways of thinking so they
26:39 could be for example uh introverts and
26:41 they could see in some Spectrum yeah
26:48 yeah different ways to communicate or
26:51 different ways that they are motivated
26:52 to do work or even that they communicate
26:54 to others that might not be the norm or
26:57 what we know as Norm
26:59 okay so I'm wondering what are the uh
27:02 pitfalls uh why can't I just go to I
27:05 don't know to you Berlin and hire all
27:07 white dudes uh to work on this like from
27:10 computer science department from the
27:12 same group just take all of them and
27:14 have them work like isn't this enough to
27:17 have a successful company
27:20 be enough
27:21 I think um
27:24 not successful you know but I do think
27:26 that there is a limitation when you do
27:28 that because you are basically building
27:31 something for the world and the world is
27:34 a diverse place and you're building
27:36 something that addresses only one group
27:37 that is the group that built this so
27:40 um it's hard when you don't experience
27:43 the world through the lenses of the
27:45 others that you perceive also what is
27:47 that they are facing and how is it that
27:50 they um understand the world for what
27:52 challenges they have and what solutions
27:54 they could enjoy you know so that is one
27:57 aspect but also like if you really think
27:59 uh code as a company that is trying to
28:02 sell more and make more money then you
28:05 want to broaden your audience you know
28:07 and you on the other hand you also don't
28:09 want to exclude anyone so you're
28:11 basically missing the opportunity the
28:13 business opportunity when you just uh do
28:16 something for a specific group so you do
28:19 something from A specific group that
28:21 addresses only one specific group
28:23 that's the main advantage of diversity
28:27 right so when you you don't build
28:30 usually for a specific groups so you
28:32 need to have different opinions
28:33 different voices in the team and then
28:36 somebody can say look but like this
28:38 actually is strange right so why why did
28:41 you do this and then you start a
28:43 discussion and uh like something happens
28:45 at the end yes exactly it's really about
28:49 again it's not only about having those
28:51 people like hiring them on paper but
28:53 really about creating this environment
28:55 in which everyone can collaborate and
28:57 people feel that they are heard that
29:00 they can speak up and then this exchange
29:04 starts to happen and then things starts
29:06 to come up because it's really hard for
29:08 you to understand what other people are
29:11 going through when you are not having
29:12 their experience for example
29:15 um there is uh one reported thing on the
29:19 book called lean in
29:21 that is called from the formal CEO from
29:25 Facebook so she used to be like the
29:28 right hand of Mark Zuckerberg and she's
29:30 a woman so before she was pregnant she
29:34 writes in her book that they did not
29:35 have any special parking spaces in the
29:38 office for pregnant women
29:40 and this never happened to go through
29:43 her mind or to Mark's mind so that was
29:47 it and then she became pregnant and she
29:49 was going to work normally and then she
29:51 realized that she had her own spot
29:53 because she was like the CEO the second
29:56 most important person in the company
29:59 um but then other women were having to
30:02 like find a parking spot wherever far
30:05 away and then walk all the way to the
30:07 building you know more stress for them
30:09 and also like with the weight of the
30:12 baby it becomes really something that
30:14 makes a difference in your day
30:16 um and then he got pointed out because
30:20 someone was late for a meeting or
30:22 something and then they said yeah I mean
30:23 I didn't want to take the stairs so I
30:25 had to wait for the elevator and I came
30:27 from this other building because my car
30:29 was there and so on and then she was
30:32 like yeah I have been through this and I
30:35 am a woman and I should have known
30:37 better but it like never crossed her
30:40 mind because it was not her experience
30:41 no but someone was able to talk to her
30:44 about it because she was also pregnant
30:45 and then they were like yeah I don't
30:48 have a
30:49 specific parking space that is for me
30:52 here that I don't have to walk so much
30:53 it's like okay then we have to change it
30:55 and of course as a CEO she could change
30:58 the policy and she could make an amount
30:59 of parking spaces available but yeah
31:02 this is the kind of thing that will only
31:03 come up when we can uh talk about things
31:06 and talk about our challenges and really
31:09 point out what about this or what about
31:11 that and again I don't think anyone has
31:14 a right answer but
31:16 just by discussing this we can figure
31:18 out something that is probably more
31:20 complete or addresses more people
31:24 how to create this environment in an
31:26 environment in which I can approach a
31:29 CEO
31:31 and it's not being afraid of you know
31:33 asking about these things or just not
31:36 being afraid of or feeling comfortable
31:38 discussing these things with your
31:40 colleagues who are maybe like they are
31:42 not from the same background as you I
31:44 don't know it's like maybe you're not uh
31:47 I don't know with males for example like
31:49 how do you do this especially it's like
31:51 when there are a lot of males who a
31:54 computer science with computer science
31:55 background
31:57 it must be difficult yeah I think it's
31:59 not something that just happened you
32:01 know it's not something that it's
32:03 overnight as well so I do think you take
32:05 deliberate
32:07 um work and it takes time so the first
32:11 thing I would say is to communicate or
32:14 like the leaders at least should Clearly
32:17 say like we want to hear from you also
32:21 they need to express that this is
32:23 something that they're open to
32:25 but also um you know the best example I
32:29 believe is the example by Dewey so if
32:32 you start as a leader if you'll start
32:34 sharing then maybe others feel
32:37 comfortable sharing back
32:39 and as also a person that is uh from one
32:43 underrepresented group in our field I
32:45 don't feel comfortable most of the time
32:48 to just raise my hands and say like this
32:51 is wrong you need to fix this you know
32:53 like maybe it's really about sharing and
32:55 it's like this is how I experience this
32:58 and this is how it makes me feel and
33:00 maybe there's a way that we can improve
33:02 it and baby I have ideas because I have
33:04 been
33:05 treated differently in different spaces
33:07 so I could bring also my good and bad
33:10 experiences
33:11 um but yeah I don't think that also
33:13 demanding for things is the right way to
33:16 do it but yeah really like engaging in a
33:19 conversation and specifically if you are
33:21 in a situation or a position of power
33:24 um just do it yourself and make sure
33:27 that people know that you are open for
33:29 this and I think it starts maybe with
33:31 one or two people but as long as like
33:34 new people join and they see that this
33:37 is the atmosphere they won't have this
33:39 fear from the beginning
33:42 and is it something well I know you told
33:45 us the story how AI Guild started so it
33:48 started as uh well you had this meetups
33:52 these sessions where you wanted to
33:54 connect with other women in the field
33:55 and then eventually it grew to dinners
33:58 and then and the The Guild itself so
34:01 probably this was one of the very
34:03 important aspects of the guild so you
34:05 wanted to make it diverse you wanted to
34:07 have different people in the community
34:10 but do you do you help companies
34:13 recognize that and I don't know build
34:16 such environment where everyone like
34:19 everyone's opinion is welcome
34:21 yes so it's it is something that we
34:24 discussed in our community like how
34:26 could we approach organizations right
34:28 because as individuals we can do so much
34:31 we have our limitations also based on
34:33 our roles inside the organizations and
34:36 that's when uh we decided we had a
34:39 survey for our members at the Guild
34:41 House we could address this together
34:42 with businesses and then most of the
34:45 people decided to do a for-profit
34:47 organization so that is Consulting and
34:50 this is the work that I do full time so
34:53 supporting the community but also
34:54 funding the community Through B2B
34:57 Consulting and um we don't do like
35:00 diversity based Consulting but it is our
35:03 focus is really about deployment so
35:06 machine learning to production
35:08 understanding companies
35:10 um where they are in this journey let's
35:12 say from proof of concept to production
35:14 and that is not only on the technical
35:18 aspect like we do some Consulting based
35:22 on the models or the data pipelines or
35:25 the architecture yes
35:27 and one feedback we got from company or
35:30 company client is that they like doing
35:32 this with us because we are diverse in
35:35 the aspect of
35:37 um technology so we are not a vendor you
35:39 know so we're not trying to push one
35:41 specific solution we are vendor agnostic
35:43 we are independent Consultants so in
35:46 that way we could explore diversity of
35:49 solutions but then um there is the
35:51 aspect of there you need people to
35:55 implement all of those right so you need
35:57 to hire and you need to maybe structure
35:59 a new team or expand the team you
36:02 already have and that is the aspect that
36:04 we can then uh talk more about this
36:07 aspect of diversity and for example one
36:10 of the last clients we had was a
36:13 consulting company in Germany we're a
36:16 very traditional area in finance so that
36:20 means traditionally yes a lot of Germans
36:23 and especially males
36:25 so we were doing recruitment and
36:28 training for entry-level data roles and
36:31 our goal was to have a group that was at
36:37 least 40 percent women and this is also
36:40 our gender policy for the data lift
36:43 event for example the one we are doing
36:45 in June
36:46 so we say 40 because we also don't want
36:48 to have like only women right the point
36:51 is to be diverse and then we also had a
36:55 goal to have at least 25 percent of
36:58 people that were non-natives
37:00 even though one of the restrictions for
37:03 the role is to take a fluent German or
37:06 german-edge proficient level because of
37:09 the nature of working in finance having
37:12 a lot of legislation and so on
37:15 um
37:16 yes we really had to look into different
37:22 Talent pools let's see so you mentioned
37:24 maybe we don't go to Just One University
37:26 we go to different universities that
37:28 also have programs that are taught in
37:30 English and then people come to study in
37:34 English then they learn German when they
37:35 are here
37:37 um in the end it was a very good result
37:40 so we didn't really had the final fake
37:44 or the decision maker was in the end the
37:47 company that was hiring them we were
37:49 only doing the Recruitment and training
37:50 but we managed in the end to find a pool
37:53 from 10 people in which five were women
37:57 and from the 10 people eight were
38:00 non-native so we had mostly
38:03 International representation there yeah
38:06 I was really happy about this
38:10 how did you approach this uh I mean
38:12 maybe this this one is a tricky case
38:15 when you need to find uh people who are
38:17 fluent in German in Berlin uh I guess
38:23 yes that was not in Berlin so this okay
38:26 this was in Hamburg but still in Germany
38:29 but yeah some people were not of so the
38:33 training happened in Hamburg and they
38:35 had to be there for the training but
38:37 they didn't need to move to Hamburg so
38:39 maybe they were also in different places
38:41 that because then the work itself would
38:44 be done remotely as well but yeah the
38:46 Hamburg is a pretty International City
38:48 too right yes maybe not this
38:50 Cosmopolitan is Berlin but still yeah
38:53 okay but I'm wondering um so you managed
38:56 to hire five women and I know that it's
38:59 um not easy too like if I look uh I was
39:02 on a meet-up presently uh pilate I meet
39:05 up
39:06 and there it was like I don't know how
39:08 many people
39:10 um 40 maybe and only two two women or
39:14 three women I don't remember
39:16 so like it just shows uh well it shows
39:19 like this particular sample maybe it's
39:21 biased right so not everyone goes to
39:23 meet ups but still like if you look at
39:25 the the general population now maybe
39:28 things are better than five years ago
39:30 but still
39:31 where do you find women if you want to
39:33 have a diverse team
39:35 yes again um
39:38 that you have to do intentionally it
39:41 won't just happen so what I can share is
39:43 like the poly the policy we have for our
39:46 events is that we invite women first and
39:48 we invite women to be on stage so we
39:51 make visible to women that could be
39:54 attending but there will be other women
39:56 at least the speaker you know so this
39:59 way because this is something that I
40:00 have been through already you go to a
40:02 middle because you're interested in the
40:04 topic and you arrive there and it's only
40:06 a bunch of dudes and you're like okay
40:08 who can I talk to or you know sometimes
40:11 you don't want to be approached in the
40:12 wrong way so It's Tricky and also it's
40:17 hard if you're doing it for the first
40:19 time you know you don't know anyone so
40:22 as a woman I can say one is really good
40:24 when you know that there's another woman
40:25 going so maybe you can ask a colleague
40:27 you know like I'm going let's go
40:29 together
40:30 um maybe if you know that the speaker is
40:32 a woman then you know that at least you
40:33 can approach her towards the end so that
40:37 helps and this is something that we did
40:39 also for the training and also what I
40:43 participated at the boot camp I was
40:45 hired at one of the women teaching
40:48 because they wanted to have more women
40:50 applying so putting women in
40:52 invisibility rules gives visibility in
40:55 general for anyone applying for that
40:58 event or for that initiative in a way
41:02 that they know okay one I will not be
41:04 the only one and second it also sends
41:07 the message that the organization cares
41:09 about this because they are making it
41:11 visible and I think it's the same for
41:13 all the other underrepresented groups
41:15 not only for women
41:18 and this is something you did at AI
41:21 Guild from the very beginning I guess at
41:23 the beginning it was even only women
41:24 right
41:26 so uh before it was called the AI build
41:28 we had this women meeting
41:31 um but then when we called it AI Guild I
41:33 brought all the women from this women
41:35 meeting and that in the beginning made
41:38 it really like equal 50 50. as we grew
41:41 it started to grow a lot more on the
41:43 male side so it became unbalanced so the
41:47 way to fix this or try to keep it up was
41:50 that I intentionally invited women so
41:53 every woman I got to know in the field I
41:55 invited to the AI Guild first movie and
41:57 this is something I still do like
41:59 everywhere I go if I I try also and
42:02 attend other events from groups
42:05 dedicated to women for example women in
42:07 machine learning data science or Pi
42:09 ladies and those are safe spaces for
42:12 women
42:13 so when you go there and you also like
42:16 present them with the opportunity to
42:17 speak for example then they um they also
42:21 they have those communities are really
42:23 uh for encouraging women to go to those
42:26 visibility rules to really step up in
42:28 their careers
42:29 so when you go there and then you can
42:31 tap into this pool that is being
42:33 prepared for it you know it becomes
42:35 easier as well but yeah the policies
42:37 that we invite women to be speakers and
42:40 we invite women first so that we can
42:43 like feel some roles with women and then
42:45 it becomes easier also when we invite
42:47 more women to speak that they see that
42:49 there are already women speaking
42:51 so it's like a Snowball Effect
42:54 yeah that's smart and I'm wondering so
42:57 we're talking here not about gender
43:00 diversity but diversity in general and
43:02 if somebody is a part of
43:05 um and the represented group and want to
43:08 promote like get promoted or take the
43:11 next step in their career
43:13 um
43:14 and uh yeah how can they take on
43:17 leadership roles do you have any
43:19 suggestions any advice for them
43:21 yes so I think one of the good uh or one
43:25 of the ways I did it like I'm still on
43:27 the journey right now and I don't have
43:28 all the answers but one of the ways I
43:30 found really helpful for me to grow in
43:32 my career is to find other people find
43:35 their Network you know don't you don't
43:37 have to do it alone or You Are Not Alone
43:39 there are others that there that maybe
43:41 share the same challenges or have been
43:43 to similar things and you can learn from
43:45 them and also once you have some
43:48 experience you can uh also help people
43:51 that are in the beginning of their
43:52 careers you know so there's always this
43:53 exchange aspect that I think helps
43:56 and then uh the other thing is to not be
43:59 afraid to be visible you know maybe
44:01 there is like you go to the Meetup there
44:03 is no other woman and then you never go
44:05 again
44:06 um and then maybe next time when you
44:08 don't go another one goes so if you just
44:10 keep on going or you know Reach Out
44:12 invite people
44:15 um then it starts building this Snowball
44:17 Effect but you really have to I don't
44:20 know step up and like keep doing it
44:23 until it grows so that's why I said it
44:26 takes time and it's also not something
44:28 that will happen if you just go like you
44:31 need to do something more you know like
44:33 invite others or even be the speaker so
44:36 you are visible and others see you and
44:38 come
44:40 um yeah I think those are the most
44:42 practical things to share but also on
44:46 another level
44:48 um more like four organizations maybe
44:50 you want to look for organizations that
44:52 already have a leadership that is more
44:54 diverse
44:55 or that are working towards making this
45:00 visible for their brand so there are
45:01 some companies that are visible for
45:03 having a diverse or more collaborative
45:06 workspace so you can find out about this
45:08 and I believe those would be the best
45:10 ones to start with
45:12 and one of the things you said to not be
45:15 afraid to be visible but I guess for
45:17 that you need to have the right
45:18 environment right not maybe you don't
45:20 want to be visible in some environments
45:22 and then this is I guess something for
45:24 the Meetup organizers to make sure that
45:27 you know the environment is welcoming
45:29 for people not to be afraid to be
45:31 visible and this is something you did
45:33 right and yeah
45:35 this is something that if you are an
45:38 organizer you or if you are somehow the
45:41 leader in the initiative you should have
45:43 a code of conduct yeah so with the code
45:46 of conduct then it's really about
45:48 describing what is the expected behavior
45:51 in your inside your initiative and what
45:54 is unexpected behavior and what are the
45:56 consequences of the unexpected behavior
45:58 and this was one of the first things we
46:00 did at the AIU because we really wanted
46:02 to protect the environment in a way that
46:04 it's
46:05 um Pleasant for anyone and people are
46:08 also getting excited to go there you
46:10 know because you know that it's not only
46:12 about people sharing the good part but
46:15 it's also about sharing the bad parts
46:17 and sharing what we learned becomes more
46:19 real
46:22 um like maybe I'm wrong and I see this
46:25 code of conduct is like privacy policy
46:27 on the websites something that people do
46:30 just because they have to I might be
46:32 wrong I know in your case it was
46:33 different right so because you saw you
46:35 thought of this from the very beginning
46:36 I'm not saying others do this uh
46:41 as a check mark But I imagine that it
46:44 can be sometimes like that I guess it's
46:47 not enough just to have the code of
46:48 conduit conduct yeah you have to
46:51 have the code of conduct and
46:54 leave the code of conduct you know so
46:56 yeah and for example when we thought
46:58 about it there is a famous One the
47:00 Berlin code of conduct so we started
47:02 from this one we took it as an example
47:03 and it's published online and a lot of
47:06 the meetups even on meetup.com for
47:08 example they say that our event follows
47:10 the Berlin code of conduit and the idea
47:13 was
47:14 um to take from those examples and also
47:16 from our own experiences what we expect
47:19 from people when they let's say go to an
47:22 AI Guild dinner and what is um
47:25 unacceptable behavior and what are the
47:27 consequences and how can people report
47:29 those behaviors and then it becomes
47:33 tricky when you're there at the Meetup
47:35 and then you see someone doing the
47:37 unexpected Behavior what do you do you
47:39 know like now you really have like as
47:41 the community organizer or the leader
47:43 you really have to address it you cannot
47:45 run away from it you cannot hide from it
47:48 because Yeah by hiding from it then for
47:51 one you're giving permission to this
47:53 unexpected Behavior
47:54 people that were there they maybe don't
47:57 want to join anymore because they
47:59 experienced it but also you're saying
48:02 that yeah it's just like a checkbook you
48:04 know so yeah it happened
48:06 um unfortunately I have to say it
48:08 happened uh we had to deal with
48:10 unexpected behavior and we also had to
48:13 make clear
48:15 um that this was not acceptable and tell
48:17 the person soon never come again to our
48:20 events yeah
48:22 um it's hard because you also want to
48:24 give people circumstance right maybe
48:26 people are not aware so there are some
48:28 specific cases you really have to
48:32 like have some values or have maybe some
48:35 lines that cannot be crossed you know
48:37 but in the end what you are doing is
48:39 you're really protecting the environment
48:40 so that people can keep enjoying this
48:43 and leveraging the community for what it
48:46 was meant for it which is a changing
48:48 experiences and knowledge
48:50 I guess it's really tricky when like you
48:53 need the organizer you need to
48:54 understand like okay like did this
48:57 person really cross a lot of lines so
48:59 they cannot show up anymore or maybe
49:03 like it's not a hopeless case and we
49:05 just need to speak and explain that that
49:07 this is not accessible how do you do
49:09 this
49:10 how do you yeah like maybe you don't
49:13 want to like maybe they just not aware
49:15 like sometimes you know because we are
49:17 all coming from different backgrounds
49:19 from different cultures and some
49:20 cultures some Behavior might be okay or
49:24 at least like
49:25 not drowned upon yeah that's tricky
49:29 right and this is a big challenge when
49:32 we were talking about
49:34 um this diversity aspect in terms of
49:36 culture or national analysis no like in
49:39 different countries you have different
49:41 um behavior that is accepted or not
49:44 accepted so that's what I mean with like
49:46 the hard line some things you don't
49:48 accept like if someone is I don't know
49:50 yelling or like cursing the other that
49:53 is global right that's so clear yeah but
49:56 some things are more subtle and you'll
49:59 never know also as maybe the cat is
50:02 meowing and the person that is receiving
50:04 it you also don't know what was the
50:06 intention maybe you know maybe the
50:07 person didn't have the intention but it
50:09 was so it's not easy I think it's Case
50:12 by case that you need to understand but
50:14 one thing that um definitely helped is
50:18 that we got reports from the same
50:22 behavior of the same person towards
50:24 different people so this was not a
50:27 one-off behavior no it was someone that
50:29 was doing it with different people
50:31 through some time period and that's when
50:34 we said okay uh it's worth talking to
50:36 this person but at this point there was
50:39 a lot of damage done already so yeah
50:42 I guess this is something you
50:44 at least in my experience so I didn't
50:47 need to deal with this in real life but
50:48 in slack quite often
50:50 and
50:51 I didn't think about this one starting
50:53 in a Community right so it's like
50:55 and then like the reason we actually had
50:58 to have a code of conduct was uh that
51:02 there wasn't inappropriate behavior
51:04 right and then like how could we point
51:07 to this person that this behavior is
51:09 appropriate and then of course like we
51:10 need to have this uh guidelines this
51:12 code of conduct and then yeah It's
51:15 Tricky uh yeah there's no point we even
51:18 discuss it if everyone needed to like
51:20 sign you know like when you apply to
51:22 become an AAU youth member you apply and
51:24 we just want to protect the community
51:26 from people that are not in the field
51:27 like recruiters so we do this sign up
51:31 form but we also should we ask people
51:34 like to sign or like check that they
51:35 read the code of conduit
51:37 um and then in the end we said no it's
51:39 more about if you want to be active and
51:41 participate you will read it if you
51:43 don't read it then it was always there
51:46 you know so it's your part as an active
51:48 Community member to be aware of it and
51:50 if you do something that that you were
51:52 not aware because it didn't read it then
51:54 it's really on you so we expect also we
51:57 trust everyone like which card from this
51:59 based on a trust uh Behavior right that
52:03 people really want to be part of a
52:04 community and they don't want to be
52:06 toxic and break the community so I don't
52:08 think anyone is doing that for uh
52:10 intentionally but still you can always
52:13 refer to the code of conduct and see
52:15 maybe what is uh expected and unexpected
52:19 my my own experiences even if you like
52:22 point to the guidelines 100 times very
52:26 few people actually read it but I think
52:28 in your community it's different because
52:30 it's more like it was growing uh you
52:33 know from in-person events rather than
52:35 you know just as like Community where
52:36 everyone can can join
52:43 yeah exactly and it's like you offer
52:46 people the opportunity to read it but
52:47 they will only read it if they want you
52:49 cannot force them yeah it's like this
52:51 license agreement right that you when
52:53 you install something or I don't know
52:55 accept cookies or whatever right it's
52:57 like yeah you accept and if you don't
52:59 read then you know like cannot complain
53:01 after
53:02 yeah I'm wondering how many people
53:04 actually read these license agreements
53:07 yeah I mean I think I was in at least
53:11 two or three conversations about having
53:14 some sort of AEI to go through each and
53:17 transform it into like human readable
53:19 stuff you know or at least summarize the
53:21 most important things because yeah no
53:24 person reads everything yeah
53:26 and these privacy policies are the same
53:28 thing
53:30 exactly
53:32 so that's why on our code of
53:34 can try to make it practical you know
53:36 like
53:36 you know like what are examples of
53:37 things that you shouldn't say and
53:39 examples of things that you cannot say
53:42 at anything and if you see someone
53:45 saying it what can you do
53:46 [Music]
53:48 okay so I wanted to talk a bit more
53:50 about the guild so you say right now the
53:52 way uh like you're a for-profit
53:56 organization and you offer Consulting
53:59 right
54:01 um so how does it work you companies
54:04 approach you saying that hey we want to
54:07 deploy some models
54:10 help us
54:11 something like that
54:12 yeah so the idea is really that we are
54:16 first a community and we want to
54:17 exchange experiences and from that
54:20 um we also learn a lot from our members
54:23 and the idea is that when someone is
54:26 having some issue they can come to us
54:29 through the members maybe or because
54:31 they attended one of our events but they
54:33 can come to us and we can come up with
54:35 an offer for a solution that will
54:37 address what they're looking for then
54:39 because we are part of this network of
54:41 more than 2 000 people
54:43 we basically can guarantee that we will
54:46 find someone with the expertise that
54:48 you're looking for inside our Network
54:49 and for the community or for the members
54:52 themselves they have opportunities to
54:54 contribute to the project so some people
54:56 are Freelancers so this is only or this
54:59 is all they do but even for people that
55:01 work in full-time employment as long as
55:04 it's allowed they take on like um some
55:08 trainer room or they take on advisory
55:10 roles and in that way we have the
55:12 contribution for specific challenges
55:15 that companies are looking for
55:17 so the community members do the do the
55:20 work so right so you have like a pool of
55:23 Specialists experts in certain areas and
55:25 then uh there are companies who need
55:28 some experts and you sort of match
55:31 uh demanded Supply right
55:34 most of the times
55:36 um because I'm working full-time so when
55:38 it's about my own expertise then I can
55:40 deliver the projects but for example
55:42 this last one was in finance Banking and
55:46 payments and this is not my area of
55:48 expertise so I could find in the
55:50 community people that have worked in
55:51 banks for example that have done like
55:54 for example fraud detection cases and
55:56 then they were the ones that were
55:58 advisors
55:59 okay so you work as a consultant right
56:02 so this is your full-time activity right
56:05 now
56:05 how many people are like you the for who
56:09 it's a full-time activity for the guild
56:11 to consult me and Chris I'm Lutheran my
56:15 co-founder
56:16 so two the two of you do you have
56:19 different areas of specialization
56:22 for example in data science you mean or
56:25 yeah like I don't know for example you
56:27 do model deployment and he's doing
56:29 something else
56:31 hi yes okay so it's based on our
56:34 previous experiences so I am mostly
56:36 focused on machine learning and creates
56:38 is mostly focused on the career aspects
56:41 so he was a director of a boot camp
56:43 before and he is the one that is doing
56:45 mostly the industry the take the
56:48 transition from Academia to Industry so
56:51 he's taking the lead on that and then on
56:54 the machine learning and data analytics
56:55 I am doing like the technical part of
56:58 the project but also the teaching
57:00 um
57:01 so what Chris is doing is like
57:03 upskilling people in a company if they
57:05 need to help with I don't know learning
57:08 a new tool or whatever yeah and we do
57:11 that for our members as well so we have
57:14 events uh for our members it's for free
57:16 to attend I mean we are mostly doing it
57:18 in Berlin but also uh understanding
57:21 where other members are in groups that
57:23 we could put them together in a room and
57:25 discuss the career topics and the idea
57:28 is to do kind of career coaching or food
57:31 group birth group is people that are
57:34 starting their career so until the third
57:36 year and the other one is for people
57:39 that are already seniors and looking to
57:41 grow to leadership roles until you know
57:44 Chief data officer role so for that um
57:47 Chris is mostly taking the lead on the
57:49 sessions to understand where people are
57:51 and what they could do to improve their
57:53 career growth
57:55 yeah I see an interesting question from
57:57 Asif so what if you have too many
57:59 customers and cannot cope with numbers
58:01 because it's just too few like how do
58:03 you do this do you start finding
58:05 somebody in the community to delegate
58:07 yes so if we have too many customers
58:10 which is my plan for the next years we
58:14 will hire people full time
58:16 okay that's uh that's very good yeah so
58:20 that is my vision you know that we have
58:21 so many customers that now it's
58:24 freelance based and project-based but if
58:26 it turns out to be
58:28 um Regular incoming then we can hire
58:30 people full time to do it with us
58:32 I'm looking forward to seeing job
58:35 descriptions from you
58:38 yeah and another question from as if is
58:39 can you tell us more about the structure
58:42 and hierarchy of your company but I
58:44 guess if there are just two people we
58:46 don't really have a lot of structure so
58:48 basically uh we do everything and we
58:51 work together with Freelancers or
58:52 project-based people as I mentioned but
58:54 the idea is that yeah Chris is taking on
58:57 the lead on the career topics and I'm
58:58 taking on the lead on the use case
59:00 topics
59:01 maybe last question do you have any
59:05 other any books or other resources that
59:08 you can recommend to the listeners
59:10 yes
59:12 um I want to say that the book I always
59:14 recommend is the um and it's about the
59:18 impact of not having enough diversity
59:21 working in data projects is the weapons
59:24 of mass destruction math like
59:26 mathematics right yes exactly so the
59:30 idea is that each chapter is a different
59:33 example of how harmful or somehow it was
59:38 applied in a discriminatory way because
59:40 of different aspects maybe the data was
59:43 um biased or maybe the application
59:45 itself is just wrong
59:47 um but yeah in this book is by Kathy
59:50 O'Neill and she is also someone that is
59:53 championing this idea of
59:57 unbiased AI applications and together
1:00:00 with this she was also in a documentary
1:00:02 that is called
1:00:04 [Music]
1:00:04 um
1:00:05 I forgot the name my cat is meowing here
1:00:09 um is it it was on Netflix and then you
1:00:11 forgot the name oh you can send us the
1:00:14 link and we'll just put it in the show
1:00:15 notes
1:00:16 yes when you remember the name
1:00:19 I think it was coded by us call it bias
1:00:22 okay coded bias
1:00:25 okay thank you very good suggestions
1:00:28 um yeah thanks for joining us today
1:00:30 thanks for sharing your experience with
1:00:32 us uh the Journey of AI Guild is very
1:00:34 interesting and yeah finally I'm happy
1:00:37 to return the favor and host you here or
1:00:40 better later now right
1:00:42 yes it is a good time because I am now
1:00:45 organizing the data lift Summit for the
1:00:48 second year in June so this is right
1:00:51 I want people to be aware of it you can
1:00:54 get your ticket you can still apply to
1:00:56 be a speaker if you have a use case in
1:00:58 production this is the content we're
1:00:59 looking for to have on stage and I hope
1:01:01 that you are also on our stage like you
1:01:04 yeah I need to uh do you accept
1:01:07 workshops uh Workshop proposals we have
1:01:11 keynote use case discussions and
1:01:12 workshops okay then I'll probably I have
1:01:16 something in mind cool okay yeah thanks
1:01:20 a lot thanks everyone for joining us
1:01:21 today and yeah today is Friday so
1:01:24 everyone have a great weekend
