2:31 you for having me so the questions for
2:33 today's interview are prepared by
2:35 Johanna Bayer thanks a lot Johanna as
2:37 always for your
2:39 help and let's start so before we start
2:42 before we go into our main topic of data
2:45 leadership coaching let's start with
2:48 your background can you tell us about
2:50 your career Journey so far and also
2:51 maybe you can
2:53 mention what changed in these two
2:56 years uh between our last interview and
2:58 today okay yeah so my career background
3:03 I studied computer science like um many
3:06 people maybe I don't know no I studied
3:09 computer science and then I did a PhD in
3:12 data science very randomly it wasn't
3:14 called data science back then when I did
3:16 it it was in information retrieval
3:17 natural language
3:18 processing like long long ago then I
3:21 worked as a data scientist at uh sync um
3:26 the German LinkedIn and then I worked at
3:28 fre now as almost everything data
3:32 scientist um data engineer product owner
3:36 senior data
3:37 scientist data science lead senior data
3:42 science scientist everything and then um
3:47 end of 2020 I switched to um I needed
3:52 basically a break from being responsible
3:55 for product and uh I kind of thought um
4:00 I prefer teaching other people to be
4:02 responsible for products so I can take a
4:04 step back and then recharge so I join no
4:07 Fisher where I first worked as a coach
4:10 just teaching other people data science
4:12 coaching people to switch change careers
4:15 um from anything what they had with or
4:18 without background in data with or
4:20 without background in um
4:23 industry uh and um basically leveling up
4:27 their uh or stepping into Data the data
4:30 career and um that's like um yeah that
4:35 was like 2020 so four
4:37 years and um then I took over the well I
4:41 built up the team was kind of like a
4:44 very ad hoc team before and then I ended
4:46 up leading the team and then towards um
4:48 at some point I kind of stopped coaching
4:51 people and then I just stopped started
4:52 just taking care of the team and growing
4:54 the team and uh then we also marged with
4:57 spice and then the team was huge and uh
5:00 yeah so that's my background and then
5:02 last year I studied um I thought about
5:06 um I noticed that there's like a kind of
5:08 a um little Gap in Industry um like more
5:12 like a mindset
5:15 mindset that was bothering me um a lot
5:20 of people think oh I know exactly how to
5:23 become a senior data person I just do a
5:25 lot of courses and I become a senior
5:27 data person and then leader ship
5:30 changing into leadership is just like
5:31 get the role and then just do
5:34 it and I mean that's also you see it in
5:37 senior engineering a lot of in in a lot
5:40 of companies people are like promoting
5:42 the next lead to be like the most
5:43 obvious senior in the team and then that
5:45 senior is
5:47 like I mean I've learned successfully
5:50 stuff before how hard can this be just
5:52 doing it learning on the job you know
5:54 and that's like a lot of situations
5:56 where you think about like all sorts of
5:59 let's say not optimal leadership are
6:02 people thinking just learning on the job
6:05 is enough and not like taking it
6:07 seriously so and it's not I I don't
6:11 think it's people's fault I think it's
6:12 company's fault a lot of companies are
6:14 not really investing in their employees
6:16 to think I needed something like that
6:18 when I got promoted from my senior data
6:20 scientist to
6:22 lead yeah
6:23 so yeah it's like okay now you have this
6:27 responsibilities that are completely
6:29 different from what you were doing
6:30 before exactly and you're expected to do
6:32 well in them so go figure this out and
6:35 because you've done well before right I
6:36 mean how high can it be it's like except
6:38 now you don't do anything from what
6:40 you've been doing before the work is
6:44 totally different exactly and you're
6:46 like you were you were a good developer
6:48 before and you you could evaluate what
6:51 it means to be a good developer and now
6:52 you have to work with people and you're
6:53 like totally like how do I even know if
6:55 I'm good at this
6:57 like nobody's telling us even that you
7:00 know like what does it mean to be good
7:02 at leadership or how do i h do it so
7:04 yeah so I think this is more like a
7:07 general mindset going on and some people
7:10 are thinking okay I should take this so
7:14 that's something I was writing at some
7:15 point that in my opinion switching into
7:18 leadership from any kind of engineering
7:20 or data role is kind of like a career
7:23 change and I think if we see it as a
7:25 career change then we are investing in
7:27 it like okay I'm a new learner I'm a new
7:29 person I I get into it so I started like
7:32 offering um then
7:33 coaching um more like Incognito and then
7:38 this year it's more like less
7:40 Incognito and and also providing what do
7:43 you mean by Incognito like you didn't
7:46 off Announce on LinkedIn or any yeah I
7:51 still coming to you for that yeah first
7:53 I did last year I think I offer some
7:55 free coaching sessions in exchange for
7:58 feedback kind of to also understand what
8:01 kind of problems people have and
8:05 um and also I I think I kind of had like
8:08 two Targets so those like the well data
8:10 leadership people who want to
8:14 become better leaders but again this is
8:17 a point where I'd like to specify that
8:20 in my opinion you don't need a
8:22 leadership title to want to be a good
8:25 leader I think leadership skills can
8:27 help you in your
8:30 career at so there comes a point in
8:32 everybody's career when you switch from
8:35 somebody tells you everything that you
8:37 have to do to you kind of figuring out
8:40 what you have to do and that's
8:43 like I have about that so like I
8:46 remember when I was this in the role of
8:48 lead data scientist and then I have a
8:50 problem and I approach my manager and
8:52 what he told me like
8:54 look you're lead for a reason and this
8:57 reason is you have to figure out this
8:59 stuff on your own I can help you I'm
9:01 always there I'm always here to support
9:04 you but like I need a list of ideas from
9:07 you yeah right so come up with this list
9:10 talk to people see what they need and
9:13 then let's talk again in a week right
9:15 something like that yeah yeah I mean the
9:18 the higher you get in your career
9:20 the whatever whoever your manager is
9:23 will not really have so much time to
9:25 have you on their mind
9:28 100% And yeah I think at some point
9:30 people really high up in their career
9:32 like you know like VP and whatever they
9:34 don't even have one ones anymore like
9:36 it's just you know it's like nobody like
9:38 there's nobody who knows 100% what
9:40 you're working on so in order for
9:42 someone to really help you 100% they
9:45 need to be um totally aware of your
9:49 situation and then if you just have a
9:51 one a one once a month for half an
9:54 hour and otherwise you don't really see
9:56 your manager that much that's not enough
9:58 time to
9:59 and if you go like that just say hey I
10:01 have this problem what should I do you
10:03 will just get an and they go for giving
10:06 you a helping you giving you a solution
10:09 that is most likely to be super
10:12 unoptimal that solution that would be
10:14 like like they have totally different
10:15 cont context they're busy with other
10:18 stuff and like they don't have time to
10:20 really deep go deep into your problem
10:22 and then give you right exactly and and
10:26 that can happen I mean it doesn't have
10:28 to be that you're high up in your career
10:30 it just has to be you can be in a
10:32 company where they're bootstrapping
10:33 everybody and then you have a manager
10:35 that is managing 15
10:38 people you all everybody knows about the
10:40 pizza by the way death by Pizza
10:42 everybody knows about the pizza like you
10:44 should only manage uh Pizza that you can
10:47 eat so like seven eight slices and
10:49 everything more than seven eight people
10:52 that you are managing is supposed to be
10:54 too large to do a good
10:56 job um direct reports I mean so
11:01 yeah why you have this death by Pizza
11:04 T-shirt oh or it's
11:07 unrelated totally unrelated I'm
11:09 organizing this conference in Hamburg
11:11 python Pizza Hamburg uhuh and then I saw
11:15 this t-shirt was at a um music festival
11:18 in Hamburg rapper band Festival it's by
11:20 an artist from Austria and I thought oh
11:23 I'm actually running the conference in a
11:25 couple of weeks so I bought the t-shirt
11:26 for the conference this is usually what
11:28 I wear
11:29 at python Pizza since you mentioned that
11:32 maybe you can briefly talk about python
11:34 Pizza
11:36 yeah the py okay python Pizza is the
11:39 best python conference ever because
11:43 there is pizza red there is pizza and
11:47 there's a big focus on having newcomers
11:51 giving a talk all the talks are 10
11:54 minutes and then then when you you give
11:57 a 10 minutes talk you actually force
12:00 people to just talk about one idea one
12:02 topic and it's very focused and and also
12:05 you can listen to a 10 minutes talk even
12:06 if you don't like it because you know
12:08 it's over in 10
12:09 minutes so you don't need to you don't
12:12 have to sit there and scroll exactly so
12:16 yeah so I think the conference it just
12:18 happened now in February also in Prague
12:21 and uh I think the Berlin people are
12:23 going to bring it back this year to
12:25 Berlin some Berlin scene might know it
12:28 and it comes from actually of course I
12:30 mean it does come from Italy we just
12:33 imported it
12:36 yes um so going back to your idea of uh
12:42 you cannot eat too much pizza six seven
12:45 slice at most slices at most and the
12:48 same with the team like you cannot IM
12:49 manage more than six seven people at
12:51 once right you can but well I mean you
12:54 can also eat a very large pizza right
12:56 but then you kind of get sick how do you
12:58 feel after that cuz like every time I
13:00 eat pizza like I don't feel that it's
13:03 enough for me right and then I eat eat
13:05 and then until it's like super not super
13:08 too much right yeah just too much and
13:11 then like okay no it was too much and
13:14 the same that's the point that's the
13:16 same yeah and then the problem is that
13:18 the next day you will not be able to eat
13:20 pizza right you're going to be like oh I
13:22 ate enough pizza for the whole month
13:25 now yeah that's what happens when you
13:28 you can really you can manage a lot of
13:30 people I mean that is not impossible but
13:33 it's not
13:35 sustainable so it's not sustainable for
13:37 your own personal health and it's also
13:39 not um going to be like really good like
13:43 just like with pizza right like I mean
13:45 like the first three slices are amazing
13:47 and then the next slices start to be
13:49 like okay I've already eaten like that's
13:51 why it's nice to go with friends to eat
13:52 pizza so you can like swap slices from
13:54 their Pizza just because it gets boring
13:58 the same pizza for I don't know so um it
14:01 starts like feeling like you cannot put
14:04 as much interest and effort and work in
14:08 a SLI or a person to do a good job for
14:11 that person so I
14:13 think so do you think we can learn the
14:17 skills like if I'm a senior data
14:19 scientist and all of a sudden I find
14:21 myself in this situation where I need
14:24 to figure out what to do without being
14:27 told and I'm expected to actually
14:30 not being told but figure things
14:33 out what's the most effective way of
14:35 learning this you mentioned that okay
14:38 like I'm an engineer I can figure this
14:40 out as I go which is what most people
14:44 probably do but this is not always the
14:47 best the most optimal
14:49 strategy but is it still like the only
14:52 strategy or we can do it
14:55 better well the first step is to
14:58 acknowledge that this is is a completely
14:59 new thing that you have to
15:02 learn and maybe the same mechanisms that
15:07 you were using before to learn software
15:09 development are not going to match 100%
15:12 or data and whatever so so I think
15:15 there's there's the one part you need to
15:17 find some courses that are really for
15:19 this and just as you like um read the
15:22 book did some tutorials and so on for
15:24 other stuff at some point in your career
15:26 then this is the same you know be part
15:28 of some convers ations and because it's
15:31 important to start having awareness it's
15:33 like At first you're not really aware of
15:36 the new scope of problems that
15:40 exist like it's just like you don't even
15:42 know they exist because you never had
15:45 them before so it's not about always
15:47 having the solution for everything or
15:49 knowing how to deal with it but it's
15:50 also kind of opening up to this
15:52 awareness that okay this is a different
15:54 kind this is a problem that can happen
15:56 it has happened to other people and then
15:58 when I noticed I know how to identify
16:00 that the problem is coming and what to
16:02 do about it and I think the second thing
16:05 is to work together with the team and
16:09 like be transparent with the team that
16:10 hey look I'm in a new role it's
16:13 completely
16:14 new
16:16 and I will need your help in order for
16:18 us to succeed and in order to need to
16:21 get your help I don't want to do a
16:23 mistake over and over again and nobody
16:26 is uh feels safe to tell me about it and
16:29 then I end up being like you know all
16:31 bridges are burned and so on so let's
16:36 like set up already build up a feedback
16:38 culture in your team so that people and
16:41 that's also I think that is the first
16:43 skill to learn in leadership in my
16:45 opinion is to accept
16:48 feedback without saying I think you're
16:51 lying I didn't do that so
16:55 yeah so yeah sorry I interrupted you
16:58 like did finish your thought I think so
17:00 yeah so like you mentioned
17:03 courses and then I remember like for me
17:06 I also recognize that I'm an engineer
17:08 and this is a totally different thing
17:09 now I have to like instead of doing
17:12 things myself like I don't have time to
17:14 do this
17:15 anymore uh and I still think I I'm
17:18 trying like I I'm saying okay I will
17:20 take this task because this task is
17:22 interesting this is complex this is
17:24 exactly what I like doing but because I
17:26 have so many other things like this
17:29 never ends
17:30 up taking like I never finish it right
17:34 so and then I have to ask other people
17:37 to take it over and then like I realized
17:40 that there is a problem then I find
17:43 courses in the courses for me the
17:46 courses I took were quite difficult in
17:50 the way the information is presented
17:52 there in the way the information like
17:53 I'm because like as an engineer I'm more
17:56 used to this problem solution approach
18:00 mhm if I I have a
18:02 problem I go to Google I like I just
18:05 look for the solution and then I apply
18:07 this solution and this is how my mind
18:09 works most of the time right so there's
18:11 problem there's solution but the courses
18:13 they talk start talking about psychology
18:15 they start talking about like all these
18:17 things that I have no idea like what
18:18 they are all of a sudden this becomes
18:21 important to me like instead of um I
18:25 don't know architectural decisions uh
18:28 that I'm used to doing as a senior
18:32 engineer now have to think about other
18:34 things and like they just are super
18:38 unusual natural unknown and then I I
18:41 just feel completely lost when I even
18:43 look at these
18:44 courses was I maybe unlucky with the
18:48 courses
18:51 or yeah so I
18:53 personally when I stepped into
18:55 leadership I got training at work so
18:58 there was
18:59 um the company so fre now basically
19:02 hired a trainer that would train for
19:05 like a two-day workshop all the people
19:07 that were kind of new to leadership or
19:09 stepping into
19:10 leadership and I think the this training
19:15 so you see it's not a course it's a
19:17 training so first it's more like going
19:19 towards something that is more like
19:20 training um but
19:24 this this training was also more like
19:27 these are situations and the are
19:29 Frameworks to kind of deal with that
19:32 situation how do you notice the
19:33 situation exists framework and then kind
19:37 of like exercises to apply it so now
19:41 when
19:41 you like for example you need to give
19:44 feedback right cuz somebody I think this
19:46 is what you mentioned right somebody is
19:48 maybe not doing a good job but you don't
19:50 want to be super upfront and say like
19:54 your work sucks right because this can
19:56 hurt other people like you're trying to
19:59 be direct you're trying to convey as
20:01 much information in
20:03 the as little in as little time as
20:06 possible right because this is what
20:08 Engineers like doing but if you just say
20:10 like this
20:11 sucks that can hurt other people's
20:13 feeling right so you need to train you
20:16 need to learn how to give feedback
20:18 correctly yeah I always like to do the
20:20 feedback training to do it as a team
20:23 training so not just the lead learns how
20:26 to give feedback but the whole team
20:27 learns like
20:29 so so I've done it also like and this
20:32 feedback training can be done once a
20:33 year you know you always get new people
20:35 in the team and it's just something it's
20:38 a type of it's takes practice it's just
20:41 to bring to people awareness that
20:44 psychologically speaking however people
20:46 give you feedback it's going to feel
20:49 uncomfortable
20:52 and there is not much
20:55 around around that the only thing that
20:58 you can learn is how do
21:00 you
21:02 learn to react to something that is
21:05 uncomfortable to say okay I am uncomfort
21:07 I will be uncomfort I'm getting feedback
21:09 now I it will be
21:12 uncomfortable and it might be diff it
21:15 might be hard to hear but on the other
21:18 side you also want to build like
21:19 relationships with your employees and
21:21 that's why you want to invest in this
21:23 relationships and to a point where
21:25 there's trust and then you can tell some
21:28 body the the work that you did was not
21:31 good does not mean that you are a bad
21:35 developer it's just that this particular
21:38 work that you did so I think this is
21:40 something that a lot of people are
21:42 struggling to get their self worth from
21:45 another place than the work that they
21:48 did and then you cannot criticize the
21:51 work without the person getting upset
21:53 and that's something that is just
21:55 something
21:56 that takes a little bit of work I think
21:59 this applies to every as aspects of life
22:01 cuz I remember I was reading a book
22:04 about how to give not feedback but like
22:08 how to tell your kids about certain
22:11 things and then like one of the ideas
22:14 There Was You Never criticize the kid
22:17 you criticize the actions like look what
22:19 you did and this is these are the
22:21 consequences it's not because you are a
22:23 bad kid it's because this is what you
22:25 did right and yeah I mean otherwise your
22:27 kid learns that they're always bad and
22:29 then whatever they do they anyway can't
22:31 make it
22:33 better yes but this is not like how we
22:35 are be used to at least I don't know
22:39 maybe older people I don't know like we
22:41 grew up with like a little bit of
22:43 different kind of U you know our parents
22:46 I don't think they got feedback training
22:47 in the workplace and uh the books were
22:51 like different back then so yes I don't
22:56 think
22:57 um
22:59 unless you get like intentional about
23:01 learning how to give feedback it won't
23:03 really come natural
23:06 like what do you actually do as a coach
23:09 one thing you mentioned is you organized
23:10 this feedback sessions team trainings
23:14 where the entire team learns that's one
23:17 I was doing as an employee yeah I was
23:19 doing when I was like what do you do as
23:21 a
23:22 coach well currently I have a lot of
23:25 people I think coming in that are more
23:27 struggling with um
23:29 [Music]
23:31 um like becoming impactful at work in
23:35 order to to to get uh either promoted or
23:42 um for their yeah for to feel yeah
23:46 impactful so to say so I think this is
23:49 maybe in data is a little bit even more
23:52 trickier than in engineering itself
23:55 because
23:57 um
23:59 there seems to be like and I think there
24:01 still is a little bit of unrealistic
24:02 expectations of data teams it's like
24:05 yeah it's going to deliver value and
24:07 it's going to be awesome but everybody
24:09 forgets that you need to put invest in a
24:12 lot of foundation work because you know
24:15 the data has to be reliable and daily
24:17 and in real time or not in real time and
24:20 so on
24:22 and right invisible work H yeah so it's
24:26 about setting wrong kpis to
24:29 uh assess the person you need you need
24:30 to highlight that yeah you need to yeah
24:33 it's and and then it's like it feels
24:35 like you're not really doing and think
24:38 it's very hard for to say like oh I've
24:40 achieved something or it's like my work
24:43 uh the work that we're doing is
24:45 impactful uh because you're not always
24:48 fa delivering customer facing products
24:50 because you're still building
24:51 foundations and so on or the velocity is
24:54 not the speed with which you're doing
24:56 things is not as fast as some people
24:58 want so I
24:59 think um yeah so that's kind of like so
25:04 far and then
25:06 also
25:08 um how to you have like this like
25:10 training the leadership mindset for work
25:13 which is leadership mindset as I said is
25:16 not necessarily that you are a uh Team
25:18 lead but you are in roles that uh
25:22 requireed leadership skills and I
25:26 think again coming back to dat maybe
25:28 that's
25:30 like I'm not not sure if you also saw
25:34 there are some posts about it but a lot
25:35 of people are starting to say that every
25:39 data scientist has to think to have a
25:41 product
25:43 mindset like you can't just like
25:45 Implement your little model and not care
25:47 about who's using it and what other
25:49 teams are going to do with it and so on
25:51 and everybody starts to be expected to
25:53 be stakeholder
25:55 management and uh be able
25:58 to collaborate with people from
26:01 different teams and on their level on
26:04 their expectations and so on and then
26:07 communicate in timely fashion and so on
26:10 and I think this is this is leadership
26:12 this goes into leadership skills because
26:15 in the
26:16 end you need to com invest a lot in
26:18 communicating you need to invest a lot
26:20 into working with other people and you
26:22 need to invest in
26:23 like influencing other people when you
26:27 actually don't have authority
26:29 because you won't have authority as a
26:31 let's say you're a data scientist you
26:33 can't tell the front end team what they
26:36 have to do you have to convince the
26:38 front end Team how to let's say I'm
26:41 simplifying here so I think this this is
26:45 also stuff that people are coming with I
26:48 I trying to figure out ways how to get
26:50 better at this so I wanted to summarize
26:53 what you said so what you do is you help
26:56 people train their Le leadership mindset
27:00 which is about learning different
27:01 leadership skills which you can which
27:04 you probably need even if you're like
27:07 data scientist senior data scientist
27:09 maybe not even a team lead yet which is
27:12 communication skills working with other
27:15 people influencing without Authority and
27:17 all these sort of things yeah
27:19 understanding what the how to like the
27:22 value like like having a little bit of a
27:24 strategic mindset about your
27:26 work um like start to think about okay
27:29 how does my work connect to the company
27:31 goals and I'm not even talking about
27:33 kpis because kpis are going sometimes
27:36 through a lot of I mean some companies
27:38 have very clear and well defined kpis
27:42 but sometimes that's not the case and
27:46 you are supposed to kind of guess work
27:48 what the goal or the strategy or the
27:51 mission and the vision of the company
27:53 is and if you want to be impactful and
27:57 SU successful your work kind of you want
28:01 to align the work that you do the
28:03 projects that you're working on towards
28:06 that and then you what you said I think
28:09 when I asked you what do you do you said
28:12 most of the people who find me they have
28:16 these sort of problems like how to get
28:18 promoted how to have more impact but I'm
28:21 wondering how do they exactly find you
28:24 are you on some sort of uh coaching
28:26 platforms no reach out to you directly
28:30 or what I currently have a website which
28:33 is also going to be changing a bit in uh
28:36 but basically I have um I'm posting on
28:39 LinkedIn and I have a cly link that
28:42 people can
28:43 book so I'm also offering I've also
28:46 offered um so these are like sometimes
28:49 coaching is for like longer periods of
28:51 times people have like a like a more
28:54 complex problems but I'm also offering
28:56 like one shot coaching sorry uh for all
28:59 the One Shot learning anyways so I'm
29:02 also offering one shot coaching for
29:04 whoever wants to just uh have a session
29:07 and this time is can be like um hey I
29:10 have
29:11 a a job interview and I need to prepare
29:14 for
29:15 it or I've had people come with like um
29:20 I need to switch from one country to
29:23 another how do I relocate and adapt what
29:27 I know my career in this country to this
29:29 other country so that I can get a job in
29:31 this other country so it can also just
29:33 be something that we are like
29:35 discovering and it's in one hour of a
29:38 little bit in-depth conversation on that
29:40 so or CV
29:44 review just that can also just be like a
29:48 one hour
29:50 session so what is if I correctly
29:53 understood what you said so you
29:55 regularly post on LinkedIn and then in
29:57 youra profile there is a link to your
30:00 cly and people find this link you
30:02 probably say that I coach or I consult
30:05 yes and and then people find the link to
30:08 your cly where they can book a slot with
30:11 you and yeah discuss all these problems
30:15 and then what you offer is uh one off
30:19 consultation it's just one hour or more
30:23 regular uh coaching
30:26 okay and
30:28 how did you
30:30 actually find out that this is the way
30:33 you want to do it like why cently link
30:36 why LinkedIn uh why not I don't know
30:39 partnering with a website that offers
30:42 coaching like I know there are websites
30:45 where you can find like some sort of
30:47 catalog Marketplace of
30:49 mentors okay I need data leadership
30:53 Mentor so most of the websites so there
30:55 are two types of websites the ones that
30:57 there's like with payment and then
30:59 there's a lot of them that are like for
31:01 free it's like um which is nice but I
31:04 think um so the only place I'm offering
31:07 free coaching at the moment is on coffee
31:09 code breaks which is a community for
31:12 women who are needing mentoring and
31:14 there I offer a session per month for
31:17 free but otherwise yes I am why cly I
31:23 mean if you have to manage more than two
31:24 or three calendars I think that's kind
31:26 of like the only way to make um so I
31:29 have like for me if it's not in my
31:31 calendar then the thing is not happening
31:33 so uh like basically it's trial and
31:37 error right so you just you found out
31:39 eventually that this combination works
31:41 for you the best way yeah so basically
31:44 there's some people who are posting um
31:47 on like what's like what is a strategy
31:49 what are the tools that you need and
31:51 there's like different levels of like
31:52 tooling and then there's like the the
31:54 low entry like where the low payment
31:57 entry like when you don't pay so many
31:59 thing for so many things and then the
32:02 starter pack of coaching would be cly
32:04 maybe Zoom or another platform
32:07 um or Google meets is still for free
32:11 though it's kind of annoying anyways
32:14 so and then you have um how much money
32:19 you want to invest in it it can get more
32:22 fancy more crmh crmh but is it the only
32:26 thing you're doing right now you have
32:28 other
32:30 activities well I'm also doing the P pod
32:33 cats uhuh
32:35 the
32:37 hcats what is that it's um it's a
32:41 podcast that uh we started so it's from
32:43 the P python software foundation and we
32:46 want to acknowledge the contribution of
32:48 women in the python community so we are
32:51 um so women and people from under
32:53 represented groups so we've started
32:56 we've uh have now two episodes out so
32:59 one episode goes out per month and um
33:03 yeah so we are four in this
33:06 marata Georgie and Chuck and I and we do
33:10 Two Hosts one guest for podcast so
33:14 that's something fun that I'm doing and
33:17 otherwise I'm also partnering with
33:20 Shades and contrast with uh zamina where
33:23 we will offer more like trainings and um
33:28 consultancy gigs I guess Shades and
33:31 shades and contrast yes is what is
33:36 that it's it's a company that zamina um
33:41 has launched and uh she's doing um she
33:46 also wants to kind of go for
33:48 responsible AI
33:51 in like bring more responsible AI to the
33:56 German Market to say so it's of training
34:00 and consultancy there is Consulting and
34:03 H and Consulting and training and
34:04 training yeah but yeah sometimes you go
34:06 to a company you kind of help them set
34:08 something up but then you also want to
34:10 leave and for that you want to help the
34:13 team be able to work with whatever you
34:17 help them set up and then they might
34:19 need training yeah so for you your main
34:22 activity with which you earn for living
34:26 right now is coaching
34:29 yeah I mean I'm in transition I am in so
34:32 for me this year is the year of um
34:35 trying to do that yes uhhuh okay yeah
34:39 this is very interesting and motivating
34:40 so thanks for sharing
34:42 that yeah and
34:44 um how do you
34:47 usually so when somebody approaches you
34:50 you probably have some sort of framework
34:52 how exactly you're going to help
34:54 them do do you have something like that
34:56 or how does how does it usually
34:59 go so I first obviously ask about their
35:04 background and why they are there what
35:07 do they expect to get out of it and um
35:11 and then I think the hardest struggle
35:15 is um just to coach people so you know
35:19 you have training and coaching and a lot
35:21 of people I think come to me because I
35:23 have um data background so that then a
35:28 lot of people then expect training as
35:30 well M because when you do coaching
35:33 theoretically you're never supposed to
35:35 give advice like that's like the extreme
35:36 of coaching right like the it's like I
35:39 would just ask you open questions until
35:41 by the end of the hour you come up with
35:44 yourself to
35:45 the moment of like yeah you know and
35:49 then um and I think I kind of kind of go
35:53 a little bit in the middle because
35:54 there's also like sometimes advice like
35:58 there's a book there's a course there's
36:02 um have you tried this and so that's
36:07 kind of for the people coming from a
36:08 data just a general consultation right
36:11 so you can do a bit of coaching a bit of
36:13 mentoring yeah and sometimes you have
36:15 like I think
36:18 um CV reviews sometimes it's also quite
36:22 even like even if you're not looking for
36:23 a new job I think it's a very healthy
36:25 thing to do every now and then
36:28 because I think most people living in
36:30 Germany are if you compareed ACV from
36:33 someone living in Germany with someone
36:34 living in United
36:36 States you you see the difference you
36:39 know there's so much ownership in and I
36:42 did it I achieved that in a American C
36:45 and in unit in Germany it's
36:47 like yeah we did this together and we
36:49 built it and it's like U it's very like
36:53 let's say unassuming right and and we
36:56 are also kind of really bad and a lot of
36:59 us feel very
37:00 uncomfortable talking about our
37:02 achievements because they're like well
37:04 but that's bragging right I mean and is
37:08 it
37:11 like I don't think it's always bragging
37:14 like you need to be able to sell
37:15 yourself right and americ but also to
37:17 yourself you need to be able to brag to
37:19 yourself I'm talking about even to
37:21 ourselves they're like oh I like really
37:23 have achieved that and I I will own it
37:25 and I will feel much more confident from
37:28 just acknowledging that I did that so
37:30 what you're saying is like we shouldn't
37:31 feel that this is bragging this is more
37:34 like acknowledging that we have done
37:36 this like it shouldn't feel like
37:37 bragging because like this is a fact
37:39 that I have accomplished that yeah like
37:42 you in the podcast right I
37:44 mean it's like in the in the whole data
37:48 Club data talks club like the whole
37:51 community and the courses and everything
37:54 right it's like that's quite a big of an
37:56 big of an achievement as a side gig
38:00 unpaid
38:02 so I don't know how often you brag about
38:05 it well right now it's my main activity
38:09 so okay
38:11 [Music]
38:13 bragging well when people ask me what I
38:15 do I just
38:17 tell it doesn't count as bragging
38:23 maybe yeah but see it's like this
38:26 already like you you I'm putting on the
38:27 I'm being put on the spot and I'm it's
38:31 like so yeah so I think on purpose I did
38:34 it on purpose I think there are people
38:36 that are finding this way more they feel
38:39 way more
38:40 like like super confident and like oh
38:43 yeah I totally did that and and it's not
38:47 like they are born like that you know
38:49 it's just it's just a matter of practice
38:51 you look in the mirror 100 times a day
38:53 and you tell your or like okay maybe
38:55 five times a day and you tell yourself
38:56 that's what I did and uh so yeah and
39:01 then it's like yeah and I think also we
39:04 don't really do retrospectives with
39:06 ourselves that often I mean I've seen a
39:09 lot of people on LinkedIn they did um at
39:11 the end of the year so January was
39:13 everybody doing their retrospective and
39:15 the New Year's resolutions I decided to
39:17 do my retrospectives at a random date
39:21 this year because I kind of why why New
39:25 Years yeah
39:29 so is this something you also recommend
39:31 your clients to do the
39:34 retrospective I mean I think that's the
39:39 reflecting on sometimes maybe you need a
39:42 another person to do it just to ask the
39:44 right questions um but yes reflecting
39:50 on everything that you learned or
39:52 achieved in a let's say the past year or
39:55 in the past job
39:58 um like starting to put things in
40:00 writing on a piece of paper and then
40:03 it's
40:05 definitely can help you get like a sense
40:08 of achievement you know it's like
40:10 sometimes you feel like especially if
40:11 you're in a in a workplace
40:15 where let's say you don't have like from
40:19 your work like given goals and so on and
40:22 let's you work for four years in the
40:24 same job like no no change in title and
40:26 so on it gets like at some point you or
40:30 actually the best example is ask someone
40:32 to give a talk at a conference and when
40:34 they reply with like but what am I
40:36 supposed to talk
40:38 about nothing that I do is like really
40:42 conference
40:44 level and that that's that is like if
40:47 that's your answer then you should
40:49 definitely retrospect and just I did
40:53 this uh course on writing online ship 30
40:57 and the idea there was like what do you
41:00 write about you know how do you come up
41:01 with ideas and there was like the
41:04 concept of the twoyear rule and the
41:06 two-year rule is like to write down
41:08 everything you've learned in the past
41:10 two
41:11 years and to understand to reflect on
41:14 the fact it's like to acknowledge the
41:16 fact that there are people that are two
41:18 years behind
41:20 you and then when you want to talk or
41:22 present or say what you have achieved
41:24 it's like you talk to those people so
41:26 you always you have an audience and then
41:28 like that's also at a conference you are
41:31 likely to have people that would be two
41:33 years behind or one years behind that's
41:36 such a good piece of advice cuz like I
41:39 find
41:40 myself regularly in this situation when
41:43 somebody approaches me and say hey we
41:44 want to invite you to talk at a
41:46 conference and then like okay I've
41:49 stopped being individual contributor
41:51 like four years ago and all I did was
41:54 like just talking to people as a
41:57 data science lead like what I'm supposed
42:00 to talk about I know that's but but
42:03 that's the that's the curse of switching
42:05 from Individual contributor to
42:07 leadership you you get like a huge
42:11 uh this is what I was also saying like
42:14 your goals are not well defined in in
42:17 your work and they're not you you knew
42:22 exactly before what your value was and
42:24 now you
42:26 don't so
42:30 you then it becomes like you don't talk
42:32 about it even to yourself right like
42:34 you're like trying to like let's not
42:36 acknowledge the elephant in the room the
42:37 fact that I have no idea what I'm doing
42:40 and I have no idea how to talk about
42:42 that it has any value to someone you
42:45 know sure I let 15 people nobody quit
42:48 while I was there I mean but doesn't
42:50 that happen to everybody it's like no it
42:52 doesn't and um I got good reviews as a
42:56 manager doesn't that happen to everybody
42:58 no it doesn't I like the people under me
43:02 they grew in their role like I don't
43:04 know within two years five people
43:07 leveled up doesn't that happen to
43:09 everyone no it doesn't you know and so
43:12 there's a lot of conference worthy
43:15 material all of yeah but then you have
43:18 like different conferences now you have
43:20 to go to different conf mhm yeah so it
43:22 would be not a p data conference where
43:26 you talk about prediction I putting like
43:29 your model for fraud detection in
43:31 production but it would be like maybe
43:34 some team lead conference where for
43:37 example but you could also talk about P
43:39 data you could also talk about Pi data
43:42 because like let's put the model in
43:44 production right but what happens and
43:47 behind the scenes of putting the model
43:49 in production you have to convince the
43:51 whole company that this model should be
43:53 in production right you have to convince
43:56 your team that they have to deliver it
43:58 like convinc I mean agree and work
44:01 towards a goal and then it has to be
44:03 you're not doing it yourself right alone
44:06 so all of this stuff like without this
44:08 kind of um work there would be no model
44:11 to go in production because first you
44:13 have like I don't know it used to be
44:15 this uh there used to be this
44:17 conversations before everybody used to
44:19 say yeah from data science only like 10%
44:22 of the models make it to production or I
44:24 don't know some random percent that was
44:26 very small
44:28 and uh and that was the problem because
44:31 like behind every technical model every
44:35 technical piece of code that you're
44:37 writing in the data team you have like
44:40 way more work in communicating about it
44:44 it's the same with like open
44:46 source so I'm I'm part of the Python
44:49 code of conduct um work group
44:53 and now I noticed as part of this group
44:57 how much communication happens be behind
45:00 every issue and put request and so on
45:03 and that's where like the art of
45:05 communication and I think it's like I
45:07 don't know it's like I'm looking right
45:12 yeah Community is super distributed like
45:14 people are everywhere in the world yeah
45:16 yet they need to make a decision right
45:18 and like the decision makers are spread
45:21 around the globe but you need to reach
45:24 some sort of consensus like do you
45:26 accept full request or what and I think
45:29 like like that's why I think uh there's
45:33 also this uh volunteer
45:36 burnout that people are saying for com
45:39 for open source because it's not just
45:42 writing code and you have to you are
45:44 wasting you're spending so much energy
45:46 on talking about writing
45:48 code so yeah so I think next time you
45:52 get invited to give a talk you say yes
45:56 and then figure out what you're going to
45:57 talk
45:58 about and I was wondering one why there
46:01 are no questions in slid but I noticed
46:03 that I forgot to post the
46:05 link apolog for that but I see that
46:08 there are some questions already in the
46:10 live chat and we talked about
46:14 different communication different uh
46:17 leadership skills and one of them was
46:20 leading without Authority which is
46:23 especially true especially relevant for
46:25 data people uh cuz they don't have
46:29 influence over the engineers who are
46:30 supposed to implement something or maybe
46:34 over product people CU often case it was
46:38 in my company like that we all have
46:40 different reporting lines so I have a my
46:44 data uh head of data then for product
46:47 manager they have head of product for
46:49 engineers they have engineering manager
46:51 right and in such a setup I need to go
46:55 to the product manager and convince them
46:57 that look we need to try to get this on
46:59 the road map cuz this is important
47:02 there's no way I can like going through
47:04 my manager is super complex CU like it's
47:07 it will never reach right so like I need
47:09 to convince that person in front of me
47:12 that this is the good idea and there's a
47:13 question from Adonis like do you have
47:15 any
47:16 tips regarding influencing like how do
47:19 you actually do this when you don't have
47:21 any Authority especially which is
47:23 especially true in case of data FKS
47:28 yeah so I think one of
47:31 the cornerstones is learning how to
47:34 speak different work
47:37 languages so like how you talk to other
47:40 data scientists is going to be different
47:42 how you talk to product
47:44 people and how you talk to Tes engineers
47:49 in another team people and how you talk
47:52 to sales and how you talk to the sea
47:53 level and so
47:54 on and then it's also about listening so
48:00 so practicing talking different
48:01 languages and also practicing like this
48:04 active listening like really and with
48:06 active listening um you
48:09 start hearing what people actually have
48:13 as a problem or what they care about
48:15 what are their own goals and what are
48:17 their own perspectives and then you can
48:19 organize your message to fit to
48:24 that um like you want to be able to
48:28 communicate to the other person to the
48:30 level that they will understand what you
48:32 are saying so a lot of the times our
48:34 problems in
48:35 Communications is are is that within
48:40 communication is just about delivering a
48:44 message but actually communication is
48:48 about making sure that the other person
48:50 understood the message the way we
48:52 intended them to understand it so that's
48:55 a little bit more work how do I get them
48:59 to do what I
49:01 need that sounds
49:03 very but I like I have a project right
49:06 and then I need to get this on the road
49:08 map like how do I do that well you just
49:10 have to make sure that they will find
49:12 whatever you need to be
49:15 important and I do that by active
49:18 listening or well you do that by
49:21 communicating why that is important how
49:23 is important for them you for this
49:27 you need to find out what is important
49:29 for them because otherwise you
49:31 can't link it to something that is
49:33 important for them why should they care
49:35 you really like if you can't if you
49:37 don't connect it to why they care about
49:39 it why they should care about it
49:43 I and of course you can get a lot of
49:46 people to do whatever you want if you're
49:48 like best friends with
49:50 them which also requires a lot of
49:53 investment to get to that
49:55 level
49:58 so Network like sort of networking try
50:00 to summarize what you said like first of
50:02 all you need to understand what they
50:04 care about mhm so then you also that's
50:07 the active active listening and then
50:10 also learning the language they
50:12 use and you also need to be friends
50:16 right not just uh
50:19 well relationship relationship
50:22 yeah and and there was another part is
50:25 like
50:28 to also so I
50:30 think this was a this was a u a problem
50:34 I noticed in well with data
50:37 science people
50:40 was if you been on a direct track
50:45 like like very linear career
50:49 path then you most likely don't really
50:52 you were not exposed to how other people
50:55 in other teams work and what other roles
50:57 are there in a company to make things
50:59 work so this it was not just data
51:02 science but also software engineers and
51:04 so on so I think I also worked in teams
51:06 where we saw like there is no value
51:08 behind having a project manager I mean
51:10 we can also decide what we have to do
51:12 there is no value behind having a
51:14 product owner so while holding this view
51:18 on the world you're are not going to be
51:20 able to collaborate well with a product
51:23 owner and a project manager the best way
51:26 to work on this view
51:29 is find ways to expose yourself to like
51:33 to put yourself in their
51:36 shoes to to
51:38 understand how do they work
51:42 when when is it good for them when is it
51:44 bad for them when is it like a risk or
51:46 not a RIS how do they evaluate something
51:48 as good or bad and so like how would
51:51 they how would things be in an Ideal
51:54 World just simple example is like this
51:58 relationship when a product owner or a
52:00 product manager goes to the data
52:01 scientist and ask how is the project
52:04 going like after one week and you're
52:07 like what I need three months to give or
52:10 two three weeks to come up with and why
52:12 do you bother me now and you're like
52:14 yeah but I need because you know your
52:16 outcome is used by another team so I
52:18 need to link this and I need to know you
52:21 know so yeah what adonus wrote so this
52:25 is also about about empathy then which I
52:28 think is yeah you can't really so get
52:32 away from empathy there are all sorts of
52:35 ways to improve your empathy and I think
52:38 uh there's uh courses for that but I
52:41 think uh the science behind empathy is
52:44 that people who are working at you know
52:47 like that they have emotional
52:49 intelligence are more
52:52 successful in their career so if that's
52:56 a good reason to get good I think what
52:59 you mentioned is the key idea how you
53:03 can do this you mentioned try putting
53:05 yourself in the other person's shoes
53:08 like if you try to put yourself
53:10 in in the position of your product
53:12 manager yeah then you can try to
53:14 understand what kind of problems they
53:16 have to deal with exactly what problems
53:18 they have and what they find annoying
53:21 you know because because maybe like you
53:23 got just often telling them hey can you
53:25 do this can you do that you know like
53:27 you don't even know how annoying it is
53:28 for the other person and they're like
53:30 polite and then they don't say anything
53:32 but if a person is annoyed then they're
53:36 most unlikely they're not really likely
53:38 to help you out yeah there is a funny
53:42 comment that there's description of the
53:44 role of a data scientist leader makes me
53:46 think that this person is similar to a
53:49 therapist oh yeah especially if you in a
53:52 cross functional team setup uhhuh okay
53:56 so this it's an accurate description
53:58 yeah I think when when PE companies are
54:02 saying okay we go completely cross
54:03 functional and now the lead of the data
54:05 science team is because every data
54:07 scientist is in a different team so
54:10 there is no so we have the data science
54:12 needed does not actually hold any more
54:15 responsibility for any kind of product
54:17 pillar and so on just for the people and
54:19 that is being a therapist yeah okay well
54:24 and no is that we need to finish quite
54:27 soon but there's one thing I wanted to
54:29 ask you so the topic of today's
54:33 interview is let me just read
54:37 it uh it's inclusive data leadership
54:41 coaching talk we talked about data
54:43 leadership we talked about coaching but
54:46 we did not talk about inclusive so what
54:49 does it mean and how you do this yeah so
54:52 I
54:53 think if you think about the opposite of
54:56 inclusive being exclusive it's like no
55:00 you you don't really get too far by
55:03 being exclusive in the
55:05 workplace what does it mean be exclusive
55:08 um like you don't want to work with
55:10 other people you don't want to
55:12 collaborate with other people you don't
55:14 need other people you don't care about
55:16 other
55:18 people uh you don't care about their
55:19 needs you don't care about how they want
55:21 to be treated so that is being exclusive
55:24 that like being authoritarian Aran in
55:27 leadership that is also exclusive you
55:29 know like you know you get your work
55:32 done because I said so I don't care if
55:34 you careed about it or not like that is
55:37 so yeah so I think the oppos so I don't
55:39 see any kind of like anything positive
55:43 out of being really exclusive at work so
55:47 and then inclusive comes um I mean you
55:51 have diversity and inclusion so that's
55:52 also the inclusion from there but I
55:54 think is about figuring
55:56 out and it's not like an afternoon of
56:00 reading online how to do it is but
56:02 figuring out how other people want to be
56:04 treated
56:06 and working with that MH so I was not
56:10 actually correct when I said that we did
56:12 not talk about this cuz we actually we
56:15 talked about it yes yeah okay like all
56:18 this empathy and trying to put yourself
56:20 in the shoes of the other person and
56:23 then understanding why they should care
56:26 about our problem or what they care
56:29 about in general these all are aspects
56:33 of being inclusive right yeah and then
56:36 on the other side you also have like of
56:38 course cultural and gender and a team
56:41 diversity and and there we all know that
56:45 in in product and if we work on the data
56:49 science part we are probably in product
56:51 or in
56:52 analytics it's important to have diverse
56:55 perspectives when you're building
56:56 something otherwise you might not have a
56:59 big overlap with the people you're
57:01 building
57:04 for so I think with that we can conclude
57:09 our interview I don't see any other
57:12 questions uh I don't think we covered
57:14 all the questions that we prepared but
57:16 we kind
57:17 anticipated yeah but we touched most of
57:20 the points um so yeah thanks a lot Thea
57:23 for joining us again and and uh yeah
57:27 thanks everyone too for joining us being
57:29 active asking
57:31 questions yeah I guess that's it yeah
57:35 thank you Alexa and then if anybody
