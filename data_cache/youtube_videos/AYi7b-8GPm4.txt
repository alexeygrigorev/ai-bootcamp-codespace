1:10 are you ready to start let's go
1:15 so let me just open my notes
1:18 so this week we'll talk about the
1:20 interview process getting hired as a
1:22 data scientist and not only data
1:24 scientists and we have a special guest
1:25 today alec
1:26 elect workers data science worked as a
1:29 data science manager at uber
1:31 where he built data science teams he
1:33 also has experience building
1:34 several startups in europe and recently
1:37 he created
1:38 next round which is a company a free
1:40 service for practicing
1:41 interviews and receiving personalized
1:43 feedback and learning materials
1:46 welcome glad to be here thank you for
1:49 having me
1:50 so before we go into our main topic of
1:52 recruitment and interviews
1:53 let's start with your background can you
1:55 tell us a bit
1:56 about your career journey so far
2:00 so i started as a software engineer i
2:02 was
2:03 building websites for a few years and
2:05 then at some point i heard about the
2:07 netflix prize
2:08 it was uh one of the first open data
2:11 science competitions
2:12 uh a few years before cuddle i believe
2:15 and i got some so engaged in this topic
2:18 of personalization that
2:19 ended up raising a phd phases about
2:21 recommender agents
2:23 and then i transitioned from an engineer
2:25 to an analyst in a startup
2:28 eventually i became a manager i led a
2:31 team of data scientists and engineers
2:33 working on recommender engine product
2:36 analytics and
2:37 building the data infrastructure in that
2:39 company
2:40 and after that i wanted to apply
2:44 for another data science job in a
2:46 startup called least
2:48 and i thought
2:51 i'm probably not the most experienced
2:53 data scientist applying for the job
2:55 uh i also needed the visa and i i just
2:58 began
2:58 brainstorming how do i make myself stand
3:01 out so they
3:03 don't reject me right away and i don't
3:05 even get to
3:07 to talk to anyone from the company and i
3:09 try to reverse engineer the the process
3:11 and think about it
3:12 when someone applies for a job in my
3:14 team
3:16 what do i do what do i look at in in cvs
3:20 uh what are the signals that i'm trying
3:21 to to get
3:24 and you know usually when you when you
3:26 look at someone's cv and it says
3:29 experience in python it doesn't really
3:31 tell you much because
3:33 it's very subjective maybe maybe the
3:35 person read a blog post about this or
3:38 invented the language you never know so
3:39 i thought okay i need to stand out from
3:41 the other candidates
3:42 and i also need to somehow demonstrate
3:46 that this buzzwords in my cv machine
3:47 learning big data python
3:49 um is actually something that i'm
3:51 familiar with
3:53 and this was an e-commerce website and
3:56 they were carrying for
3:57 a data scientist to improve their
3:59 recommended agent
4:00 and i thought okay i need to make
4:03 something differently
4:05 so instead of sending a cv i wrote a
4:07 blog post about
4:09 how i would improve the recommender
4:10 engine if i worked there
4:12 but since i did not work there
4:16 i didn't have any data so i had to be
4:19 creative and
4:20 i found i basically took a list of
4:22 brands that they were selling
4:23 on this website and wrote a very simple
4:27 python script that gets a list of their
4:29 followers
4:30 from twitter and then i implement the
4:33 very simple
4:34 recommender algorithm in python
4:38 that basically lets you type your
4:40 twitter nickname
4:42 and then you will get recommendations
4:44 based on who you follow
4:45 and the model that has been trained on
4:47 this designers that are being sold by
4:49 this website
4:51 so i wrote this blog post send it to
4:52 them and
4:54 what i had in mind was okay i want to
4:56 show that i understand the very basics
4:58 of machine learning i can program a
5:00 little bit
5:01 uh essentially to
5:04 to to demonstrate this you know the very
5:06 first chapter of any
5:07 machine learning book assigned to them
5:10 surprisingly it worked out and i got the
5:11 job
5:12 uh was it a public post did you just
5:14 publish it on i don't know towards data
5:16 science or you sent a document to them
5:19 so i i put it on media on medium but i
5:22 put it down afterwards because
5:24 uh i didn't know how much of it
5:28 uh can be public okay
5:31 even though i used only uh the data
5:34 accessible
5:35 everywhere but you know i tried to do a
5:36 little bit of reverse engineering like
5:37 what kind of data
5:38 is being sent from the website what kind
5:40 of apis they're using and so on
5:43 so i i put it down at some point there
5:45 is there's actually an article about
5:46 this
5:48 from the other from the other side by
5:50 recruiter that hired me and explained
5:52 this uh hiring experience from there
5:56 that was very interesting to it um but
5:58 this is how i got that job
6:00 um there i focused on deployment of
6:03 machine learning models personalization
6:05 ranking
6:07 and a little bit of data engineering and
6:09 scaling the the data infrastructure
6:11 after it i joined uber in amsterdam as a
6:14 product data scientist
6:16 in a couple of years i became a manager
6:20 again and led a team of data scientists
6:23 that worked on
6:24 forecasting models and the goal was to
6:26 predict
6:27 the lifetime value of a user and
6:30 quantify the impact of different
6:32 events on on user behavior
6:36 and i like to
6:39 last year and every time
6:42 i applied for a job in data science
6:45 there was one thing that i really hated
6:48 when you get rejected and when you read
6:51 this rejection email
6:53 and it tells you nothing so you spend
6:56 hours interviewing you
6:58 you spend hours working some take home
7:00 assignment
7:01 and then you get some generic standard
7:03 rejection email
7:04 uh maybe maybe you even get some
7:07 feedback but usually it's completely
7:08 useless and not actionable you can't do
7:10 anything out of it
7:11 so i began to think okay what can be
7:14 better
7:15 how can i make this better
7:18 and i ended up building this free
7:20 service where
7:21 you can practice data science interviews
7:23 with the chatbot
7:25 and then you will receive detailed
7:27 personalized feedback
7:28 based on your answers with some links to
7:31 relevant materials to the topics where
7:33 you can improve so this is
7:36 what i've been working on in the past
7:37 few months you can you can check this
7:39 out i have
7:40 mock interviews for for data scientists
7:42 and product analysts uh
7:44 so far it has been on this on this
7:46 website
7:47 uh there have been 500 little over 500
7:52 more interviews so far
7:55 and this is super interesting experience
7:58 just to
7:59 analyze and calibrate the questions
8:02 because
8:03 there is never there is never a correct
8:06 answer
8:07 like there is never a infinite number of
8:10 uh correct answers
8:11 if you ask some case study questions
8:13 about how would you
8:14 like build this kind of model uh
8:17 so i keep dating i keep getting
8:19 surprised in any positive way
8:23 every day because you never know what to
8:26 expect
8:26 right yes indeed so these are rejections
8:31 that you that you got do you have any
8:34 idea why they are genetic i think i have
8:36 some ideas also working as a
8:39 hiding manager like also being a
8:40 highland manager sometimes
8:42 um but do you have some ideas why uh why
8:45 these rejection letters are generic why
8:47 can
8:47 can companies give feedback well there
8:50 can be
8:50 many reasons right so first of all
8:55 uh i don't know can we call it laziness
8:58 but
8:58 let's say to hire one person you need to
9:01 interview 20.
9:02 and this is realistic this can be higher
9:04 this can be lower
9:06 to provide detailed excellent feedback
9:08 to everyone
9:10 uh will take some time and then this is
9:13 really up to you
9:14 whether you think it is worth it or not
9:18 i think it is worth it because who knows
9:21 maybe these people join your company
9:22 again like
9:23 it's always it's a closed loop there are
9:25 not so many so many data scientists
9:27 uh in the world or in a given city
9:30 um another reason apart from spending
9:33 time on it another reason can be
9:37 just being polite
9:40 and because you never know when when you
9:42 provide
9:43 when you try to provide some
9:44 constructive actionable feedback to
9:47 a person you don't know how they will
9:48 react to this
9:51 so you try to be polite and it it brings
9:53 you to
9:56 some very standard some generic feedback
9:58 that doesn't really
10:01 pinpoint you into any certain weaknesses
10:04 i think there might be some legal
10:05 reasons about this as well
10:08 what was your experience what what are
10:10 your ideas
10:12 yeah so basically what you said except i
10:14 didn't think about being
10:16 polite um because i think actually
10:19 candidates are looking forward to
10:20 receiving feedback
10:22 so i didn't think about this angle maybe
10:24 i should have but yeah i think uh
10:27 this is the like the first one is
10:31 time and then the second is uh legal
10:33 reasons so you don't always
10:35 cannot always give you back because of
10:38 some
10:38 legal stuff okay and then you decide
10:41 okay
10:42 like i hate not receiving feedback let's
10:45 create
10:46 a company a website
10:50 where people can just practice and then
10:52 we receive feedback attend
10:54 right yeah so basically what i wanted to
10:56 do i began thinking
10:59 with my experience uh as a candidate
11:02 as a hiring manager uh what will you can
11:05 i
11:06 offer right and then essentially what i
11:09 did
11:09 i wrote down a list of situations
11:13 that kept happening uh from company to
11:16 company from team to team
11:18 um for example and then this was
11:21 completely different stories like
11:23 for example as a as a data scientist or
11:25 especially as an analyst
11:26 you're always balancing between working
11:28 on some important model and
11:31 stakeholders asking you to work on some
11:33 urgent fixes or
11:34 urgent ad hoc analysis or
11:37 [Music]
11:38 you're running an a b test and then you
11:41 see that
11:42 some of the metrics improved and some of
11:44 the metrics actually got worse what do
11:46 you do
11:46 so i started just writing down a list of
11:50 situations that happened in my life that
11:52 required some some thinking
11:55 and that was generic enough to
11:59 to apply to any company and then
12:02 from this situation from this case
12:04 studies i created an interview plot
12:06 that basically introduces you into some
12:09 context you are working in this
12:10 kind of company and then your goal is to
12:13 do this and that
12:15 stakeholder comes to you and asks you to
12:17 work on this
12:18 what do you do depending on your answer
12:21 it will ask you
12:23 different follow-up questions maybe
12:25 switch a topic
12:26 or maybe go in depth to to get more
12:30 technical
12:32 and i reached out to about
12:35 30 data science hiring managers do to
12:38 get their feedback
12:39 on this interview questions that i
12:40 prepare uh so that it's not
12:43 completely biased by my by my personal
12:45 experience
12:46 uh in this companies that i work at i
12:49 got a lot of very interesting feedback
12:50 from them
12:52 and then i just published this website
12:56 and so far so good everyone likes it
13:00 you said you had 500 more contributors
13:03 but the title for this
13:05 uh event today is what i learned after
13:07 interviewing 300 data scientists
13:10 we update it to 500 lives well
13:13 we can walk into this yeah like this
13:18 because the practice of practice
13:20 interviews
13:21 but then it's the same thing okay so
13:24 speaking of
13:25 uh interviews so um
13:28 i imagine you did quite a few interviews
13:30 at least 300
13:32 so how does a typical interview process
13:34 process look like
13:35 what are the steps in this process so
13:38 there is no standard here
13:39 right it really depends on the company
13:41 on on the size of the company
13:43 but usually after you send your cd
13:47 and a recruiter checks if you're seeing
13:50 if your cd if your experience matches
13:52 the the job description
13:54 then they might have a call with you and
13:56 ask a few things about your
13:59 experience that were not clear from from
14:01 your cv just
14:02 again to make sure that your experience
14:04 is relevant
14:05 to a certain role in the company
14:08 the recruiter might also ask you a few
14:10 questions about the seller expectations
14:12 and
14:12 your availability for the new job
14:16 after that if your experience
14:19 seems relevant to this job some
14:22 companies will send you a take home
14:24 assignment
14:24 expecting you to spend a few hours on
14:26 that
14:28 and after that there will be several
14:30 rounds of interviews uh one of them
14:33 will be with the hiring manager and most
14:36 of the time
14:37 you get to speak with the actual manager
14:40 and
14:42 after the interviews uh there will be a
14:46 debrief when the hiring manager
14:48 and everyone who interviews you will
14:49 discuss
14:51 uh we'll discuss your experience and
14:52 make the final decision
14:54 and you'll either get a job offer or
14:57 receive
14:58 this uh generic rejection email usually
15:04 and in this so you mentioned case
15:07 the screen by the recruiter home
15:10 assignment
15:11 and then a bunch of technical interviews
15:13 uh
15:14 with hiring manager so what kind of
15:16 technical interviews are there
15:18 so i imagine for data scientists so they
15:21 should be developers i mean they should
15:24 be able to code so i guess one of these
15:25 checks coding
15:26 right so what else well yeah it really
15:29 depends on the role
15:31 okay right and i even tried to visualize
15:34 different types of
15:36 job profiles
15:39 and what what i did i did an exercise
15:41 when i just took
15:42 some random 50 data science jobs and i
15:45 found a lot
15:46 of data science jobs that have literally
15:48 nothing in common
15:50 right it's uh it's so generic
15:54 and data science is a is just an
15:56 umbrella term that includes
15:58 machine learning engineers and product
15:59 data scientists
16:01 and on one side there is an expectation
16:03 that you will code a lot but
16:06 you will be building and deploying
16:07 machine learning models that work in
16:09 production on the other side the
16:10 expectation is that you'll be running a
16:12 b tests and writing a lot of sql and
16:14 being more of a pm that is uh very
16:17 confident when it comes to
16:18 working with data so the technical
16:21 interviews will depend on the role
16:23 uh on the high level
16:26 whichever company you interview probably
16:28 at some point they will ask you about
16:29 your
16:30 previous experience uh it might be a
16:33 question
16:34 uh like tell us about some facility
16:38 model that you built in the past and
16:39 that you're proud of
16:41 and at some point most likely you will
16:44 be asked about some hypothetical case
16:45 study
16:47 and very often this is just some very
16:49 weak and generic question like
16:52 how would you predict user journal
16:56 okay so uh you mentioned product data
16:59 scientist this is somebody who is more
17:01 like analytical and machine learning
17:02 engineer is
17:03 an engineer right and then there is
17:04 whole spectrum of things and you need to
17:06 look at the actual job description to
17:08 figure out what exactly to
17:10 uh to expect during the the process
17:12 right i think that's that's the main
17:14 advice in general like
17:15 we can stop this podcast right here
17:18 but the main advice is study the job
17:22 just keep
17:22 studying nothing in the job description
17:24 learn as much as you can
17:25 about the role and
17:29 try to match your experience
17:32 with with the role right
17:37 and to explain is say you
17:40 you have two years of experience for one
17:42 year you worked as an accountant
17:44 for for for the second year you worked
17:46 as a machine learning engineer you
17:48 you're applying from for machine
17:49 learning engineering
17:50 will you dedicate as much time to your
17:52 accounting experience as to the machine
17:54 learning
17:55 engineering no right so
17:58 if you have to put i don't know a year
18:00 of your
18:01 work experience or 10 years of your uh
18:04 work experience
18:05 on a piece of paper you need to make
18:07 sure it is as relevant as possible
18:09 to the role you're applying for and at
18:11 the end this is all about
18:12 the sequel and the noise you want to
18:14 emphasize the things that are the most
18:16 relevant
18:17 uh to the job and just remove all the
18:21 lies about
18:22 your jobs that that you have after
18:25 after college 10 years ago that are not
18:27 relevant
18:28 so yes this brings us to the to the
18:31 question about cvs
18:32 so and this is the very first uh step
18:36 in uh in the job process right so
18:38 recruiter
18:39 or hiring manager somebody looks at your
18:42 cv
18:43 which is a piece of paper one or two or
18:45 three pages right
18:46 and they figure out if
18:49 this candidate should go through the
18:52 process or they reject
18:54 them right away right so how do we make
18:56 sure that
18:58 we can pass this cv screen uh phase so
19:00 you mentioned that
19:02 you need to make cd as relevant as
19:05 possible to the job
19:07 and i guess for that you need to really
19:10 read the job description and see
19:11 how your experience matches uh what else
19:14 can you do there like how can you
19:17 make your cv stand out
19:20 so i would think of cd as your
19:24 landing page right
19:28 and think about some website you
19:32 you see an ad on the internet you click
19:34 on the link you
19:36 end up on some website that you have
19:37 never seen before
19:39 in two seconds you will decide to close
19:41 it or not or this is something relevant
19:43 and you will keep looking at it
19:45 and the way
19:48 websites are designed and implemented
19:51 has changed a lot in the past 20 years
19:52 right if you if you compare like
19:54 internet 20 years ago just just next
19:56 to what it is now there is a lot of
19:58 change because
20:00 there have been a lot of experimentation
20:02 there have been a lot of
20:04 improvements so think about cvs in the
20:06 same way
20:07 the recruiter that is looking at your cv
20:10 so what what is their goal of the
20:12 recruiter that will will
20:13 look your cv when uh when you apply for
20:15 a job the goal is to
20:18 quickly estimate uh
20:23 how valuable you will be in the company
20:25 if you join
20:27 and even more specific their goal is to
20:30 estimate
20:31 what will happen if they set up an
20:33 interview between you and hiring manager
20:36 how likely the hiring manager is to uh
20:38 to offer your job
20:40 or reject you right because
20:43 if every candidate the goal of a resume
20:47 or cv for you is to get to an interview
20:50 it's not even to get a job it's just to
20:52 make sure that the interviews will
20:53 happen
20:54 and you will get to talk to someone
20:56 someone technical
20:57 so when the recruiter looks at your cv
21:01 they might even not be familiar with the
21:04 with the technical side of it
21:05 so what they have is the job description
21:08 they spoke with the hiring manager about
21:09 the skills required
21:10 the skills required for the role they
21:13 have on
21:14 one hand and they have your cv on the
21:15 other side and then you can think of it
21:17 offer as a of a very simple
21:21 classification model that just looks for
21:24 for keywords that just does the the
21:26 screen search
21:28 the job description says no i don't know
21:30 tensorflow
21:32 do you have this word tensorflow in your
21:33 cv the
21:35 job description says i don't know be
21:36 proactive are you proactive
21:40 so we try to do this uh this matching in
21:43 your mind understand what the role
21:45 requires
21:46 unfortunately job descriptions are also
21:48 very generic most of the time
21:49 but try to do this try to apply the the
21:52 job description to your
21:53 to your past experience and personalize
21:56 std for every role you are planning
21:59 because
22:00 this is your goal to pass this screen
22:02 and then
22:03 you will you will be able to to chat
22:05 about your
22:06 your past experience
22:10 and demonstrate your your technical
22:12 skills recruiters are
22:14 always on your side when when they look
22:16 at at your city when
22:18 they have a call with you recruiters are
22:20 on your side because
22:23 their goal is to fill the role
22:26 to place someone in the role so
22:30 it's in their interest for you to get
22:31 this job
22:33 so you can if you're having a call with
22:36 recruiter
22:37 ask them about the expectations ask them
22:39 about the process they would be
22:40 very happy to to help you
22:44 but on the other side
22:47 again if you think about the this very
22:49 first step
22:50 recruiters cv screen by recruiter
22:53 if you think about it as a classifier
22:57 there is a very high penalty for false
23:00 positive
23:01 for false positives if the company hires
23:04 the person that
23:06 is not relevant for a job maybe they're
23:08 struggling something else but not for
23:09 this certain role
23:11 this is a big problem for both right uh
23:14 guessing a job is a big commitment so
23:16 there is a very big penalty
23:18 for this kind of error
23:21 but at the same time there is zero
23:22 penalty for
23:24 not hiring a good person uh a good
23:27 candidate
23:28 because no one will even know if they
23:30 were good or not
23:31 so this classifier tends to create a lot
23:34 of
23:36 false post negative errors and
23:39 essentially a lot of candidates that
23:42 would have got on their job
23:43 if they passed the first the first stage
23:47 get rejected at the very first stage so
23:49 in your cv
23:52 try to
23:54 [Music]
23:57 try to first understand what is
23:59 important for this role
24:00 and what have i done and the best that
24:02 is important to this role
24:04 and make sure you highlight it as much
24:06 as possible and remove
24:07 it and remove everything else move all
24:10 the noise
24:11 then whenever you are describing your
24:14 past experience in in your car
24:18 job or in your previous job try to be
24:21 very specific
24:22 about what was your personal
24:24 contribution to a project
24:25 because for example if you if you write
24:28 on the cv
24:30 i work on predictive models
24:34 uh i don't know improving accuracy of
24:37 predictive models like
24:38 lit lists was nothing like okay your
24:40 data scientists you are expected to do
24:42 that
24:42 what exactly did you do or even if you
24:45 write
24:47 something we improved the accuracy of a
24:50 random forest model by x percent
24:53 like what exactly did you do did you
24:57 identify the problem did you decide to
24:59 use random forest
25:01 so try to be very specific in what
25:04 exactly
25:05 in what was your contribution to
25:07 whatever project was
25:09 and
25:13 this is this is the main advice i think
25:15 also if you're applying to a company
25:19 to maximize your chances of pacing
25:21 through this
25:22 first step of the cd screening
25:27 you can try to reach out to your
25:28 recruiter directly you can try to reach
25:30 out to someone from the team directly
25:31 and ask them about the company
25:33 ask them about the team in the company
25:34 if you know someone ask for a referral
25:37 it always helps to uh to pass this first
25:41 step uh at least someone will definitely
25:44 look at your cv and
25:45 probably you will secure this this first
25:48 press call be selling from the company i
25:50 think it gives an extra signal that okay
25:53 somebody from within the company
25:54 somebody who already passed our
25:56 hiring process deferred this person so
25:59 this person must be good so let's take a
26:00 closer look at the cv
26:02 and exactly exactly and also
26:06 this probably sounds very obvious but it
26:08 happens uh
26:10 check for typos and errors this this is
26:12 really
26:13 bad single because it just looks very
26:16 unprofessional
26:17 uh make sure the the formatting is
26:20 is consistent throughout the throughout
26:23 the document
26:24 um don't try to
26:28 lie about things uh and pretend that you
26:32 you build something that single-handedly
26:34 do something that
26:35 that you haven't because this can
26:37 backfire you never know maybe maybe this
26:39 company is interviewing your company or
26:40 your colleague
26:42 if you haven't you don't know and you're
26:44 both trying to pretend that you
26:46 you did something that none of you that
26:48 know what you did so this can really
26:50 backfire
26:54 and sometimes i see people that
26:57 put the self evaluations like python
27:00 five stars expert
27:02 so it doesn't make a lot of sense
27:06 yeah so basically just to summarize so
27:08 cv is your landing page and people spend
27:11 uh
27:11 like on a landing page they don't spend
27:13 more than two seconds so this is the
27:15 time span uh you will get when recruiter
27:17 looks at your cv so you need to maximize
27:20 the chances that you will pass this
27:22 stage and you do this by highlighting
27:23 what is important for the role
27:25 you remove everything else and you need
27:28 to be specific about your personal
27:30 contribution and then it will maximize
27:34 the chances that within these two
27:35 seconds the recruiter will take a look
27:37 at your usb
27:39 and then decide okay i want to look more
27:42 at this cv and eventually
27:44 you will pass the screen right after you
27:46 pass the screening
27:48 so what happens next
27:51 so after you press the screen most
27:53 likely there will be interviews
27:55 there might be a take home assignment uh
27:58 that will probably take a few hours for
28:00 you to
28:02 to implement
28:04 [Music]
28:06 there are controversial opinions about
28:07 take home assignments
28:10 because it takes a lot of time if you're
28:11 applying to five different jobs then you
28:13 need to work on five different take-home
28:14 assignments and it will take the entire
28:16 week
28:16 uh i'm not a big fan of take home
28:18 assignments for that reason because
28:21 uh it's more of a signal like whether a
28:24 person have time
28:25 for them to expect them to work on the
28:27 home assignment or not
28:28 rather than the reaction skills but at
28:31 the same time
28:31 if you're given a take-home assignment
28:34 uh think about it
28:35 in this way what's the return of
28:38 investment
28:39 in spending your time on this day
28:40 concern if you get this new job well
28:44 you applied for this new job for a
28:45 reason right probably you think it's
28:48 uh it's it's a better team it's a better
28:50 career opportunity
28:52 most likely there will be some pay
28:54 increase usually it's at least
28:56 some 15 so if you spend this
28:59 one day working on take home assignment
29:01 it will pay off if you get the job
29:03 so think about it from from this risky
29:05 work perspective
29:06 because it really pays off to invest
29:08 into preparing for interviews and
29:11 spending your time uh
29:16 emphasizing your your strengths and
29:18 demonstrating your your skills when
29:20 you're interviewing because
29:22 if you're not willing to if you think
29:24 it's not worth time to
29:26 to work on this then maybe this is not
29:29 the job that you really want
29:31 um anyway after the day after the take
29:33 home assignment
29:34 uh there will be interviews um most
29:38 likely will be some
29:39 from three to six rounds of interviews
29:41 with different
29:43 uh different potential colleagues and
29:46 one of them will be with the hiring
29:47 manager
29:49 on the technical rounds i think you can
29:52 split these two
29:53 situations like uh at some point you
29:55 will be asked about your
29:57 past experience at some point it will be
30:00 some hypothetical questions
30:01 most likely about the company
30:05 if you are asked about your past
30:06 experience make sure you have
30:10 not if it will happen
30:13 make sure you have a couple of stories
30:16 when
30:18 a couple of stories from your past
30:20 experience that help you
30:23 demonstrate your skills you i think it's
30:26 really important to practice
30:28 uh to know exactly what you're going to
30:31 say
30:32 because when you're answering about your
30:34 these questions about your past
30:35 experience
30:36 it's not only about i don't know i used
30:39 i used random forest to predict
30:41 house prices when you when you tell the
30:43 story you can
30:44 also highlight a lot more than your
30:47 machine learning skills and again when
30:50 you're telling
30:51 about your past experience try to
30:55 emphasize your strengths between the
30:57 lines if you were the one who
30:59 identified the problem and suggested to
31:00 use a machine learning
31:02 model to solve this problem save
31:05 if you suggested several
31:09 modeling approaches and ask stakeholders
31:11 for the feedback
31:13 and then identify the requirements say
31:16 that you did
31:18 if you found some interesting findings
31:21 when you worked on this model and you
31:22 decided to
31:23 share it with your colleagues and made
31:25 everyone more efficient
31:27 mention it it's not just about the model
31:30 even if
31:31 even if it may be presented as a some
31:34 technical
31:35 interview even if you're asked about
31:36 some model that you built in the past
31:38 by answering this question you can
31:40 highlight a lot more
31:43 than just your modeling skills and those
31:45 are the skills that
31:46 really make the difference between say
31:49 middle data scientist and
31:50 senior data scientist because this
31:52 really shows your
31:54 how autonomous you are how breadth you
31:56 are that you can
31:57 make everyone else around you more
32:00 efficient than
32:01 encourage others this is really helpful
32:04 and if you are asked about some
32:07 hypothetical case
32:11 usually well it's hard to say because
32:15 again there are so many companies and so
32:17 so everyone is doing it differently
32:19 what is very common is you will get
32:22 asked a question about some very awake
32:25 problem statement it can be uh again
32:28 predict the use return predict uh
32:31 classify
32:31 which users are uh fraudsters on our
32:35 on our platform predict how many orders
32:38 or
32:39 subscriptions we will have next month
32:42 and it's always intentionally some
32:44 very vaguely defined problem statement
32:47 and when you're answering this kind of
32:49 questions
32:50 i think the very first thing
32:54 is to demonstrate that you're trying to
32:56 understand the business goals
32:57 like ask back what what do we do it for
33:01 who will be using this
33:02 uh model what are the use cases
33:05 how do we define
33:08 the the return if you are predicting
33:12 which users will turn what is shown like
33:13 is it people that will not
33:15 place an order within two weeks make it
33:16 more concrete so that you
33:18 understand the problem before you rush
33:20 into into the details
33:22 and then try to make sure that your
33:26 narrative is very structured so that you
33:28 start to start by understanding the
33:29 goals
33:30 then okay like what kind of data do we
33:32 need what kind of
33:34 model do we choose uh
33:37 we built the model how do we evaluate
33:38 this try to not
33:40 jump from some very abstract things well
33:43 like what do we do
33:44 into explaining how certain modeling
33:46 approach works and then back to
33:50 [Music]
33:51 showing the results and talking about
33:53 the the next steps with the model
33:55 try to be very it's okay to take some
33:57 time
33:58 uh and think think about this uh
34:02 but this is also this also lets you
34:03 highlight your communication skills
34:07 and at each step
34:10 you want to think about okay what is the
34:13 goal we are trying
34:15 we are building the model we want to
34:16 predict charm because of this and that
34:18 um we need to get the data uh what kind
34:22 of data do we need
34:23 here you can demonstrate your business
34:25 and product and common sense
34:28 by by just thinking out loud which
34:30 features
34:31 will have impact on the output then you
34:34 can
34:34 you can start thinking about the
34:35 modeling approach the goal is
34:37 okay we do we need explainability yes do
34:40 we need to run it real time
34:42 yes no what kind of data do we have
34:44 that's why i choose
34:45 uh gradient boost injects
34:48 so that it's not so that you always
34:51 explain
34:51 your choices and then what can happen is
34:54 that the interviewer will
34:57 sometimes interrupt you and give you
34:59 some new piece of information because
35:00 they want you
35:01 to go deeper on some certain topics
35:06 and see if you can identify some edge
35:09 cases
35:09 uh some limitations of the of the
35:11 algorithm that you use some limitations
35:13 of the
35:14 evaluation metric that you chose
35:17 but at every step you it's very it's
35:20 it's it's a good practice to start with
35:22 understanding the goals explaining the
35:24 goals what i'm trying to achieve here
35:26 and then go
35:30 detailed enough so that it doesn't sound
35:32 like common sense
35:33 but it sounds you sound like an engineer
35:35 right so for example
35:36 when you're when um
35:39 when you need to explain what features
35:42 you would use to build a model
35:44 don't say
35:48 i don't know don't say churn rate say
35:49 something like users that didn't play or
35:51 orders within a certain period don't say
35:53 conversion rates it's something that
35:55 that that you can quantify something
35:58 that you can
35:58 implement in in sql or in python or
36:01 whatever
36:02 so it's not just a common sense sensor
36:06 and you can really think this extra step
36:10 and put it in gold and implement this
36:14 this is this is a very common reason for
36:16 rejections
36:17 when um
36:21 when data scientists just start throwing
36:23 a lot of different ideas we can do this
36:25 and this and that
36:26 and do not go deep enough into
36:29 any of them because
36:33 at the end you need to implement things
36:35 right
36:38 okay so basically
36:42 you can get uh from three to six rounds
36:44 of different nature
36:46 some of them will talk about uh will ask
36:48 about your past experience you need to
36:50 prepare some stories for that
36:52 like how you did something how you
36:54 identify the requirements how you help
36:55 your colleagues
36:57 um things like this then there are
36:59 sometimes
37:00 what you i think called hypothetical
37:03 questions i usually call them case
37:05 studies
37:06 but like they ask you hey
37:09 we want to predict we'd like to do to
37:12 identify
37:13 users who uh give our company uh like
37:16 stop
37:16 using our services for example like
37:18 churn things like this they
37:21 sound weak and this is on purpose so you
37:23 need to figure out
37:24 how to get more requirements
37:27 and then yeah i guess
37:30 this study mentioned there could be some
37:33 other types of
37:35 rounds like i guess sql
37:38 maybe machine learning related maybe
37:42 python and things like this right of
37:44 course
37:45 yeah it really depends on the company
37:47 and on the role for some roles
37:48 you will be asked
37:51 about machine learning in details like
37:53 how how broad is your knowledge of
37:55 different algorithms
37:56 and then if you say that you're familiar
37:59 the most with one of them
38:00 how deep do you know this certain
38:02 algorithm
38:03 the limitations you can explain how it
38:06 works
38:07 uh in what situations it works it works
38:09 best
38:10 and so on if you're applying for
38:12 [Music]
38:14 more like analytical or product data
38:16 science rules then it's very likely that
38:18 there will be some sql questions
38:20 uh most likely you will not be asked
38:23 like simple things about these things
38:26 and
38:26 joins expect questions on
38:30 window functions i think it became a
38:32 standard
38:33 to see if they decided it's terrible i
38:36 have to google this every time
38:39 people expect you to know that no i
38:42 think it's okay
38:43 like this is my personal perspective i
38:45 think it's okay that
38:46 uh if your code doesn't work but at
38:49 least you understand like
38:51 what it is how it works and you can
38:53 google it you know what to google for
38:55 this is enough right because you will be
38:56 able to google it at work
38:59 but at least you know that there is such
39:00 a thing that
39:02 then you know that there is a rank or
39:04 you know that there is a lag
39:06 but you don't have to remember the exact
39:07 syntax
39:10 and uh yeah often happens then for
39:13 example
39:14 i forgot how to write how to use windows
39:17 window functions but for this company
39:19 this is a super important thing
39:21 and they decide to reject me so how can
39:23 i
39:24 handle this rejection so how how can i
39:27 uh
39:27 yeah what happens if i get rejected uh
39:31 so first of all don't take it personally
39:35 because it's not an exam right uh it
39:38 doesn't say that you are bad it doesn't
39:39 say that you are not qualified uh
39:42 it probably says that there was someone
39:44 else who is
39:45 more relevant for this certain role and
39:47 nothing else
39:48 and you never know who you are competing
39:50 with
39:51 maybe there was someone with five years
39:55 more of experience than
39:58 than than you have or maybe someone who
40:01 have
40:02 more relevant experience for for a
40:03 certain campaign industry
40:05 so it's never it's never
40:09 uh it should never help you it should
40:11 never harm your
40:12 your self-esteem um also
40:16 realistically interviews are far from
40:18 perfect
40:19 and the outcome is uh sometimes
40:22 arbitrary
40:22 so maybe they made a mistake so this
40:25 this also happens
40:26 so you never know uh if you get rejected
40:30 ask for feedback if if if you were not
40:33 given a feedback
40:34 because this will hopefully help you
40:37 identify
40:38 what are the things that you can improve
40:39 on also
40:41 uh depending on the company maybe you
40:43 can just reapply to the same company in
40:45 a different team
40:46 right away uh usually it is it is load
40:50 and it again shows that maybe you are
40:52 not a good fit for for a certain role
40:54 but you are still a good fit for for
40:55 some different role in the same company
40:57 if you are thinking about free playing
40:58 for the same role then maybe
41:01 uh if it's a large enough company and it
41:05 keeps hiring data scientists for for a
41:06 certain role usually after some
41:09 cool off period after a few months you
41:10 can reply to the same role
41:13 um so i think you can think of it as
41:17 a learning experience try to get as much
41:19 from it from from learning perspective
41:21 write notes write down
41:24 the questions that you were asked and it
41:26 will help you become more confident on
41:28 the future interviews
41:29 the feedback will help you study and
41:32 prepare for the future interviews
41:36 and yeah let's say
41:39 i had a couple of rejections but i
41:41 learned from that
41:42 and then on the fifth interview
41:46 some other company i finally got the
41:48 offer
41:49 so what happens there like uh
41:53 what do i do now do i jump into
41:54 accepting and call all my friends
41:57 uh saying hey i got this this job or
42:00 do i need to do something there we
42:02 celebrate so if you get an offer well
42:04 first of all
42:05 uh learn what you're offered
42:09 the offers can be very different
42:10 depending on depending on the country
42:12 and
42:13 a company it can be just the salary it
42:15 can be salary
42:17 and some equity compensation it can also
42:20 mention some
42:21 some bonus it can also have some
42:24 sign-on bonus try to
42:27 learn how does it compare to the
42:30 to other companies there is glassdoor
42:32 there are other websites where you can
42:35 uh try to estimate and find some
42:38 baselines on
42:39 how how relevant this offer is for for
42:41 this world
42:42 and then i think it's always a good idea
42:45 to negotiate
42:47 because it doesn't harm like
42:51 they will not change their mind if you
42:54 try to negotiate a little bit
42:57 uh but your success with negotiations
43:00 really depends on whether you have
43:02 another offer
43:04 [Music]
43:05 because if you have two competition
43:08 offers then
43:11 it can't happen that they will match the
43:13 competing offer
43:15 if uh it is still within some range
43:18 if it is still within the budget that
43:21 that that load for a certain world
43:24 [Music]
43:25 if you're negotiating and it sounds like
43:29 it's not possible to negotiate on the
43:31 base salary
43:32 ask if it is possible to get assigned a
43:35 sign on bonus
43:37 but if you don't have competing offers
43:39 then most likely
43:43 you don't have a lot of negotiation
43:44 power so maybe you will be able to get a
43:46 few thousand extra
43:48 maybe not uh that's why it's good to
43:51 have
43:51 to interview in a few companies at the
43:53 same time to have this
43:55 leverage yes
43:58 having multiple offers is probably the
44:00 best uh
44:01 way you can negotiate other
44:04 other ways like
44:07 like that that doesn't really work so
44:10 another offer is probably the best
44:11 option
44:12 yes we have quite a few questions um
44:14 yeah i think maybe we can cover them
44:17 so one of the questions i see in chat
44:20 from natalia
44:21 is uh about h so do you know if
44:25 recruiters pay attention to the age of
44:27 candidates
44:27 so if somebody is 40 years old um
44:31 like well is it a combat signal for the
44:36 recruiter
44:36 or they're not supposed to know
44:40 just just don't put it on your cv don't
44:41 put your picture don't put your age
44:44 okay and that's uh that's that's what
44:47 that's all you
44:48 you can do or
45:01 so they are not supposed to reject you
45:02 on this basis
45:05 right somebody younger okay i'll
45:08 go with that person no of course
45:12 no i think this is this is not a reason
45:14 to not hire anyone
45:16 but if you have your date of birth or
45:18 even the picture in the cv i would just
45:20 remove them because
45:22 this kind of personal information on
45:23 your cv it is noise
45:25 right uh because it has nothing to do
45:28 with how
45:29 well you how valuable you will be
45:32 in the for the for the company for the
45:34 team then just remove it
45:37 the same goes with picture i i guess so
45:41 your marital status your address okay
45:47 yeah so if this doesn't tell you how
45:50 good you are at your job don't put it in
45:53 your cv
45:53 exactly probably you still need to keep
45:56 the name because
45:57 even though it doesn't
46:03 so we have a question from dixa so i am
46:06 a
46:06 phd scholar with zero industry
46:08 experience
46:10 but i have knowledge required by
46:11 industry expert so how
46:13 do i land a good data science job
46:17 so think about it as a cold start
46:20 problem
46:22 when you don't have initial data and you
46:23 need to build some model
46:25 you need to create some synthetic data
46:27 right
46:29 so you can go to google.com that's why
46:33 you can go to some other places that
46:36 offer you data
46:37 ideally you want to be creative and come
46:39 up with some
46:41 problem that can be solved with the
46:43 machine learning or whatever you
46:45 whatever is your specialization so i
46:48 started by by telling this story about
46:50 how i got a job by building this
46:52 fake and simple recommender engine this
46:54 is exactly that
46:55 because for the hiring manager what
46:56 matters the most is whether or not you
46:59 have some experience
47:00 in um in the data science process like
47:04 if you're
47:05 building machine learning models then it
47:07 starts with identifying the problem
47:11 goes through building the model and
47:12 evaluating the model and then
47:14 communicating the results and
47:16 identifying the next steps
47:18 it's not as important whether it was
47:22 your personal project or it was a
47:24 commercial experience
47:26 because what's important is the skills
47:28 ideally
47:29 this should be some commercial
47:30 experience where when you work with the
47:32 team of other data scientists that
47:33 you have some supervision uh from from
47:36 your colleagues
47:38 uh if you don't have it just create this
47:40 experience
47:41 uh identify problem just try to be
47:43 creative there is a lot of things to
47:46 to be solved with uh with predictive
47:48 models with
47:49 different kinds of models write a blog
47:51 post about this
47:53 and mention it on your cv and the best
47:57 thing you can do is uh
47:58 try to build something for the company
48:00 you are applying for because this will
48:01 certainly make you stand out
48:04 okay so what you're saying is uh kaggle
48:07 is great but if you
48:09 check what the company is doing and like
48:11 you did
48:12 you thought okay what kind of problems
48:14 they have and you come up
48:16 with a problem and then you solve this
48:18 problem and you wrote the blog post and
48:19 showed it to
48:20 the parent manager and then they were
48:22 amazed and hired
48:24 exactly i mean it's not 100 that you
48:27 will get hired
48:28 but if you spend time building some
48:30 models
48:31 specifically to to have something in
48:34 your cv
48:35 to to have to be able to tell this story
48:37 about your past experience
48:39 you will also learn by doing this right
48:42 don't think about this
48:43 it's such a waste of time they will not
48:44 hire me i will i will spend
48:46 a weekend or i will spend the week
48:48 working on this uh project and writing
48:50 this blog post and then at the end
48:52 it will not work out then it was a waste
48:54 of time no you learned you're a data
48:55 scientist you
48:56 this is what you chose to do this is
49:00 interesting this is exciting
49:01 you you learn some new things
49:04 so you will benefit in any way if you
49:07 if you do yeah thank you
49:10 so another question we have is that some
49:13 email some rejection emails
49:15 look quite human the question is is it
49:18 worth
49:18 answering such questions like when you
49:21 get a rejection so what do you
49:23 what should you actually answer to these
49:25 questions
49:26 do the recruiters even look at what you
49:29 write them after the rejection
49:31 oh just um right thank you like what
49:34 i mean there is no point in arguing
49:37 and that's probably the worst thing you
49:39 can do
49:41 no just say that you appreciate the
49:43 feedback this is the best thing you can
49:44 do because again
49:45 maybe you will apply to the same company
49:47 and it will be the same record maybe you
49:49 will buy it to a different company and
49:50 this recruiter will change jobs and will
49:52 make you there
49:52 this happens very often uh so just just
49:56 try to not burn bridges even if
49:59 you think it was unfair to you uh try to
50:02 learn from it and
50:04 yeah i think you can you can only
50:06 appreciate and
50:07 send the stuff thank you email to
50:10 the feedback to entry feedback if if you
50:13 found it
50:14 actionable and useful thank you so
50:17 another question we have
50:18 from uh muhammad is uh
50:21 related to negotiations so how do i
50:24 negotiate offers
50:26 when my current salary is quite low i
50:28 think we kind of covered that
50:30 by having two offers um but let's say
50:34 i just have one offer and my current
50:36 salary is low
50:37 what can i do to make sure that i
50:40 try to get the best possible offer from
50:44 this company
50:46 just try to put yourself in the shoes of
50:48 the company
50:50 and and think about them they offer you
50:53 some
50:54 uh some number you can
50:58 you either accept it or not and then
51:00 they lose you and they will need to hire
51:01 someone else
51:04 they are not supposed to know what your
51:05 current seller is also i think i think
51:08 in a lot of companies it's it's just so
51:10 in a lot of countries it's just legal to
51:12 request
51:13 uh to request this if they ask you you
51:16 don't have to
51:17 to answer you can always just answer i
51:20 think my salary would
51:21 the offer uh i'm expecting you
51:25 from you is a good signal of how
51:27 important data science is for the
51:28 company
51:29 and how you well you meet as an employee
51:31 which is true
51:33 but you don't have to tell the exact
51:35 number that you're making right now
51:36 so try to make it more about like here's
51:38 my skills you interviewed me you made me
51:40 an offer
51:40 you found me valuable for the company
51:43 but i find it low
51:44 so i'm hesitant about accepting
51:48 uh what what can we do about this
51:53 okay so just try to uh
51:57 negotiate uh basically and say that
52:01 oh i when you have another offer you can
52:05 always say
52:06 uh uh if you don't do this i'll go to
52:08 the other company
52:10 but uh in negotiations you have
52:13 you always have an option of not
52:15 accepting an offer so if you don't have
52:17 another offer
52:18 you just have one you always have an
52:19 option of staying at your current place
52:21 or
52:22 not accepting and this is the best
52:24 alternative you can
52:25 just say okay for this number it doesn't
52:27 make sense for me to change a job right
52:30 you can always say uh if it is true you
52:33 can say
52:35 i have a good performance with you um
52:37 there's a good chance that i will
52:38 promote it next year
52:40 so i'm not sure if it is worse for me to
52:41 join with an offer like this
52:44 maybe you could offer me a silent bonus
52:46 that would offset
52:47 this uh this bonus that i'm expecting in
52:50 my current company
52:51 um so try to explain
52:56 that you're losing something you have a
52:59 better option than the offer that
53:00 they offered you and
53:04 they have to offer something else for
53:06 you to not choose this alvarez option
53:09 yeah thank you so another question we
53:12 have from
53:13 somebody who just finished their phd
53:17 and the job position they want to apply
53:19 requires three or five years of
53:21 experience
53:21 in industry which they don't have
53:23 obviously because they just graduated
53:26 from phd so do you think it still makes
53:29 sense to apply for this position that
53:31 requires some
53:32 industry experience or it's uh not worth
53:36 spending the time
53:38 well it sounds like it's it's some
53:39 entry-level position like if it's uh
53:42 three years of experience i think it
53:44 won't harm if you play
53:46 uh again depends on your depends on your
53:48 pg like this definitely happens when
53:50 people with no
53:51 commercial experience uh get carried at
53:54 this
53:54 at this kind of roles uh as long
53:58 as long as you do believe that
54:01 you could perform well in this role
54:04 right
54:04 if your experience when if when working
54:07 in your phd you've gotten the
54:08 relevant experience so if you were
54:11 working on something
54:12 very theoretical and i don't know have
54:14 never uh
54:16 implemented machine learning models you
54:17 think your programming skills are
54:19 are not good enough and it is very clear
54:22 that the role expects you to program a
54:23 lot
54:24 then do not apply but in general
54:27 the it's very flexible job descriptions
54:29 sometimes are just very standard
54:31 uh if you have one one year of
54:33 experience less
54:34 it's i think you should definitely give
54:36 it a try and
54:39 and i liked your point uh in the the
54:42 example you had about
54:44 like it's a cold start problem and you
54:46 need some synthetic data
54:47 to bootstrap your profile sort of
54:51 so just try to get some experience not
54:54 necessarily from the industry
54:56 and if this matches the
55:00 [Music]
55:01 the candidate profile they are looking
55:02 for maybe the hiring manager will just
55:04 go for this even though you don't have
55:07 three years of experience but because
55:09 the project you need is so great
55:12 they will at least talk to even right
55:16 okay so another question we have this
55:20 i heard that these days uh uh named nd
55:23 recognition and some other things uh
55:25 i used for screening cvs like it's not a
55:28 human
55:28 that looks at the cd but some sort of
55:30 robot
55:32 do you need to just uh
55:35 to maximize your chances for applying a
55:38 job do you just need maybe to
55:40 copy the keywords you see on the
55:42 description and paste them in your cv
55:44 to maximize your chances or what
55:46 whatever you
55:47 don't put the keywords that that you're
55:49 not familiar with
55:51 uh what i was saying is you probably
55:53 have more experience
55:54 than some five keywords or you cannot
55:58 put a year of experience or more than a
56:00 year of experience in
56:01 in one page of paper right so try to
56:03 really make it as relevant as possible
56:06 and remove everything that is not
56:07 relevant
56:12 sorry i forgot what was the the question
56:15 yeah i think uh like if you should
56:17 just copy and paste things from okay uh
56:19 what automatic screen is
56:21 um so what happens often is uh you
56:24 submit a cv in a pdf or whatever format
56:27 then it is automatically parsed and it
56:30 is
56:31 stored in some other database applicant
56:33 tracking system
56:34 so the parsing is used to to just
56:38 have a database with structured data
56:40 this is a very clear
56:41 data problem right you have a thousand
56:43 cities in a very different format and
56:44 pdfs and images
56:46 you wanted to to have in some structured
56:48 format in a table where
56:50 you have first name you have ideally
56:52 years of experience and current role
56:54 so this happens the cvs are parsed by
56:57 applicant tracking systems
56:59 but i have never heard of some
57:02 automatic tool that projects
57:06 people based on their cvs i think this
57:08 is a myth
57:10 that for some reason became very popular
57:12 even if it happens
57:14 this is very rare so
57:16 [Music]
57:18 99 some like a human being will look at
57:20 your city
57:22 unless there is uh i know 300 or 400
57:26 applicants
57:27 for a position which happens these days
57:30 now but uh yeah probably what recruiters
57:33 do is just
57:35 whoever applied first they just go
57:36 through this as a backlog so they still
57:38 don't
57:39 reject uh automatically uh based on
57:43 some tracking system that's true for
57:45 some for some roles there's a lot of
57:47 applicants and
57:48 it's not that you get rejected
57:49 automatically because your your cv was
57:51 uh
57:52 was not in the right format but just
57:54 because there was a hundred other people
57:55 and
57:57 sometimes it's not humanly possible to
57:58 look at all the applicants that's
58:00 unfortunate but uh yeah still people
58:03 look at this and
58:04 uh they need to make a decision so i
58:07 think
58:08 so do you have time for more questions
58:12 yeah absolutely yeah because i
58:15 also wanted to ask you a few things
58:19 so first what did you actually learn
58:21 after interviewing 300
58:22 data scientists oh so
58:26 a lot of things um first of all
58:32 that i cannot walk into an interview
58:36 with some certain expectations and
58:38 answers
58:39 because sometimes the answers
58:42 uh i hear are correct
58:46 and probably are even better and more
58:49 efficient than
58:50 what i expected and this happens
58:53 and uh the the inside is you should
58:56 never
58:57 have this uh this bias like this is the
58:59 correct answer that that i'm expecting
59:00 if it's not true then
59:02 this is wrong right uh
59:05 maybe this happens all the time but this
59:07 is a very
59:08 humbling experience um
59:11 also for most of the questions like no
59:15 matter how you phrase it
59:16 even if it's some very vaguely
59:20 defined case study usually there is some
59:24 four five six different paths of
59:27 answering the question
59:28 some certain narratives and in
59:30 addressing the problems some certain
59:33 uh pitfalls uh when
59:36 for example when choosing the model for
59:39 very common reasons
59:40 like one of the common reasons is one of
59:42 the common
59:44 uh uh mistakes
59:47 is there is a number of uh
59:51 ideas like for example random forests
59:54 are always better than
59:56 linear regression right like there is
59:59 something something like this in the air
1:00:02 but this is not true right and some in
1:00:04 some cases parametric simple parametric
1:00:06 models
1:00:07 even if they require you to you do spend
1:00:09 more time
1:00:10 doing processing for even if they have a
1:00:13 lot more
1:00:14 other reasons to not perform well
1:00:17 compared to
1:00:18 using some certain cases there are cases
1:00:20 when a parametric model is just better
1:00:22 because i don't because it's an
1:00:24 extrapolate and this cannot
1:00:26 and this kind of answers i i receive
1:00:29 quite often
1:00:30 uh when you introduce some context when
1:00:35 uh it is very clear when you need to
1:00:37 extrapolate the data when
1:00:39 it is very clear that the date you will
1:00:40 be predicting on will be beyond
1:00:43 the range of the training data set um
1:00:46 but still there is this uh i don't know
1:00:49 how to call it like
1:00:51 it's not hyped it's just some common
1:00:53 misconception that
1:00:54 deep learning is better than trees and
1:00:56 trees are better than parametric models
1:00:58 uh try to understand the problem try to
1:01:00 really understand the
1:01:02 the limitations of algorithms so this
1:01:05 uh i think the most also
1:01:09 what did i learn at the 300 interviews i
1:01:11 think
1:01:13 one of the uh
1:01:16 thoughts that i had is it would be very
1:01:19 nice to be able to reverse
1:01:21 the the timeline
1:01:24 and to know what feedback you would get
1:01:27 after the interview before going to the
1:01:29 interview
1:01:31 however it sounds like a plot for
1:01:34 someone for some movie
1:01:36 but uh but this is exactly what i'm
1:01:40 trying to solve with the
1:01:41 next round right you try interviewing
1:01:44 you get your feedback on your like here
1:01:46 are your strengths here your weaknesses
1:01:47 here the materials to improve
1:01:49 and then on the next iteration you go to
1:01:52 a real interview
1:01:54 having this feedback already and having
1:01:56 applied this uh
1:01:58 this feedback and having read this these
1:02:00 materials to help improve
1:02:02 because this is how modeling works right
1:02:05 you
1:02:06 you run iterations you you turn a few
1:02:08 parameters and
1:02:09 expect it to be better so
1:02:13 i think interviews itself is a really
1:02:16 good
1:02:17 learning experience this is not very
1:02:21 obvious because i think
1:02:24 it is usually perceived as an example
1:02:27 right
1:02:28 it's some uh assessment
1:02:31 also another thing is
1:02:34 it is very important to ask questions
1:02:38 on on the interviews as a candidate
1:02:42 because this is a
1:02:45 two-way street right uh you're getting
1:02:48 you're choosing you're deciding if
1:02:49 you will like working in the company the
1:02:51 company decides whether you will
1:02:52 be a valuable team member
1:02:56 for some reason usually the time is
1:02:58 distributed like
1:03:00 for 45 minutes it's an exam and then
1:03:02 five minutes for five minutes at the end
1:03:04 if you're lucky you will be able to ask
1:03:06 a few questions
1:03:07 well if you get this five minutes or you
1:03:10 if you get more
1:03:11 use use as much of this time as possible
1:03:14 because it's in your interest to learn
1:03:16 about the company
1:03:18 but by asking questions you can also
1:03:20 highlight the strengths
1:03:21 by by asking questions about
1:03:24 uh the company about
1:03:28 the workflow in the company about the
1:03:30 teammates you can always
1:03:31 highlight you can always demonstrate
1:03:33 that you care about the culture
1:03:36 that you care about um the flexibility
1:03:39 that you're proactive
1:03:40 you can ask uh if you're working as a
1:03:42 data scientist and you
1:03:44 ask um what happens if if a data
1:03:46 scientist and the team
1:03:47 suggest some product idea uh like what
1:03:50 is the process like uh how bureaucratic
1:03:52 it is or
1:03:53 how how much time does it take from from
1:03:55 an idea to
1:03:58 the golden production if you ask these
1:03:59 kind of questions
1:04:01 it essentially you essentially try to
1:04:05 demonstrate your strengths by asking
1:04:06 these kind of questions so it's also
1:04:09 a way of
1:04:13 emphasizing some of your personality
1:04:15 traits like proactiveness or
1:04:17 being with a stakeholder management even
1:04:19 if even even the last five minutes of
1:04:21 the
1:04:22 interview okay yeah that's uh that's a
1:04:25 great tip
1:04:26 to use questions to hide your own
1:04:28 strengths that's great
1:04:29 so one last thing because this is
1:04:32 something we promised uh
1:04:34 promised to people who registered for
1:04:36 this event is to talk
1:04:38 like this this teaser that he used like
1:04:40 how a horse's ass
1:04:42 determined the design of a space shuttle
1:04:45 and
1:04:46 what does it have to do with your cv
1:04:49 yeah so
1:04:49 this is a this is a very famous story
1:04:53 uh so the legend says that
1:04:56 the the width the distance between the
1:05:00 rails
1:05:01 uh on the railroad is the same as the
1:05:04 width of a
1:05:05 two horse carriage and this makes sense
1:05:08 because people used to
1:05:09 to carry goods and themselves on uh on
1:05:12 carriages and
1:05:14 they didn't have engines they had horses
1:05:15 and then they just replied the same the
1:05:17 same size with the same tools
1:05:19 when they started using railroads
1:05:22 but then several
1:05:26 what decades or a century later
1:05:30 a space shuttle was built but they had
1:05:33 to carry
1:05:34 the parts of the space shuttle from the
1:05:36 factory to
1:05:37 to the launch site and they couldn't do
1:05:39 it by car
1:05:41 they had to do it by by train
1:05:45 and the the details of the space shuttle
1:05:49 had to fit
1:05:50 the the train so this is how the the
1:05:53 width of two horse cage defined the
1:05:57 the design of the space shuttle through
1:05:59 this limitation on the beat
1:06:01 i don't know if it's thrown out but this
1:06:02 is a very famous story so
1:06:05 every time i look at the cd i think
1:06:08 about this story because
1:06:09 cvs in this current format as a one or
1:06:12 two pages of
1:06:13 a4 paper became popular
1:06:16 in the late 20th century when
1:06:20 everyone has got a printer a microsoft
1:06:22 office
1:06:23 and this was a an easy way to
1:06:27 uh to hand them on an interview to the
1:06:30 interviewer and just just print your
1:06:32 uh have this review of your experience
1:06:35 on a piece of paper
1:06:36 because this was the way people shared
1:06:38 information before like there was no
1:06:40 internet in that time
1:06:41 now uh it doesn't make any sense because
1:06:44 no one prints the video i don't even
1:06:46 remember what was the last time i saw
1:06:47 printed cd
1:06:49 but the format is still the same and you
1:06:52 can think about
1:06:53 how other industries evolved in this
1:06:55 time again you can think about landing
1:06:57 pages
1:06:58 how web page design has changed but at
1:07:01 the end
1:07:02 a cd is is a landing page the goal of a
1:07:05 cv is to
1:07:07 show your experience
1:07:10 and to help recruiters to help companies
1:07:14 see how relevant your experience is for
1:07:16 a certain team
1:07:18 uh and the format obviously hasn't
1:07:21 changed at all during this time
1:07:24 and we just spoke about putting your
1:07:26 picture
1:07:27 your your age and i don't know your home
1:07:30 address on the cv
1:07:31 these things are completely relevant
1:07:34 um so this is this is just an example of
1:07:38 something where a cake that that is
1:07:40 still the case that defines how people
1:07:42 play for jobs now
1:07:44 uh as much as this two horses uh
1:07:47 influence the the wind of a space
1:07:49 shuttle
1:07:50 so what you're saying is we should ditch
1:07:52 our series and then build landing pages
1:07:56 now what i'm saying is uh i would i
1:07:58 would think of a cd
1:08:00 for example like as a landing page
1:08:01 something that can
1:08:03 get your attention in the first few
1:08:04 seconds and make you read further
1:08:06 because there is something you see that
1:08:08 uh
1:08:09 it is something valuable for you for the
1:08:11 company for recruiter
1:08:13 and then maybe at the bottom somewhere
1:08:14 you can you can add some details that
1:08:16 are not as
1:08:16 as relevant for the job but you can
1:08:19 think of it as
1:08:19 a webpage design on the other side you
1:08:22 can think of
1:08:23 officially as a as a future engineer
1:08:26 because requiring and applying for a job
1:08:30 is classification right there is
1:08:33 binary outcome you either get an offer
1:08:35 or don't get an offer
1:08:36 and the decision is based on this
1:08:39 prediction on how well you will perform
1:08:41 at the job
1:08:42 your past experience is your role on
1:08:45 structured data your cv
1:08:46 is is the features so
1:08:50 what do we do with future engineering we
1:08:52 try to find future importances we try to
1:08:54 remove outliers we try to clean up the
1:08:55 data
1:08:56 think about the same like you have
1:08:58 signal to noise ratio
1:09:00 put as much signal relevant for the job
1:09:02 for a certain role
1:09:04 remove all the noise uh if you think
1:09:07 about models again
1:09:08 my background is uh in personalization
1:09:11 try to personalize the cv for every role
1:09:13 you apply try to maximize this
1:09:15 relevancy score between the job
1:09:17 description and your cv
1:09:20 and not make it in the same way it was
1:09:23 in in the 80s okay make sense
1:09:27 we still have quite a few questions but
1:09:29 i suggest to
1:09:30 take these questions to slack and answer
1:09:32 them there
1:09:34 and i would like to thank you for
1:09:35 joining us today and sharing your
1:09:37 experience
