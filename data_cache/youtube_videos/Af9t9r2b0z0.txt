0:00 welcome everyone
0:02 this event is brought to you by
0:03 datadoxlab which is a community of
0:05 people who love data we have weekly
0:07 events this is one of such events
0:09 actually this week we have four events
0:12 so which is quite unusual and the reason
0:15 for that is because I will be off in
0:18 July in the entire month so that's why
0:21 we kind of
0:22 buffer the events so then we will be
0:25 releasing them one by one uh each week
0:28 so anyways we have quite a few of them
0:31 go check it out register for the ones
0:33 you like there is a link in the
0:35 description
0:36 then subscribe for our YouTube channel
0:38 if you haven't done I think more than 50
0:41 of people who watch these videos do not
0:43 subscribe for whatever reasons I see no
0:45 reason not to subscribe so do this now
0:48 and you'll get notified about all our
0:49 streams and videos and finally we have
0:52 an amazing slack community so check it
0:54 out you can hang out with other dead
0:56 folks
0:57 during today's interview you can ask any
0:59 question you want there is a link in the
1:01 description so it's pink Link in not in
1:04 the description sorry in live chat it's
1:06 pinned so click on this link and ask
1:09 your questions and I will be covering
1:11 these questions during the interview
1:13 I think that's all
1:16 I wanted to say now I will stop sharing
1:18 my screen I will
1:21 get the questions I prepared for you
1:22 Olga
1:24 okay yes now I have them sure
1:27 okay
1:28 um just one second
1:34 um my zoom looks weird okay now it's all
1:37 good
1:39 um are you ready to start
1:42 I believe so yeah
1:44 okay so this week this week we'll talk
1:48 about hiring data scientists and here we
1:50 have a special guest today Olga Olga is
1:53 a delivery director delivery data
1:55 science director at Microsoft Olga has
1:57 worked in AI for over 16 years she's
2:00 worked in different roles from
2:02 researcher to product manager to people
2:05 manager and as a director she is quite
2:07 involved in hiring data scientists so we
2:10 invited her to talk more about this
2:12 welcome
2:17 and before we go into our main topic of
2:19 hiding data scientists let's start with
2:21 your background can you tell us about
2:23 your career Journey so far right um I
2:26 started really early with the what you
2:29 would refer to as data science
2:32 so
2:33 um I was about 18 when I was studying
2:36 the university and I was sudden Applied
2:38 Mathematics
2:40 and then of all of the subject
2:42 mathematics statistics is was basically
2:44 something that got me fascinated right
2:47 away because it made sense of all of the
2:50 other things it was something which was
2:52 the most tangible and then I discovered
2:54 a lot of uses of Statistics I was also
2:57 very very lucky to have a great
2:59 lecturers and great professors along the
3:01 way
3:01 so I I think it's also to the importance
3:04 of having
3:06 great teachers in your life so I was
3:08 really lucky
3:09 and then I kind of stuck with this since
3:11 then my first job was in 2006 I was
3:15 working for a um
3:18 small consulting company Boutique
3:20 consulting company doing forecasting of
3:22 box office revenues of motion pictures
3:26 uh the model I think or at least the
3:28 approach not definitely evolved but the
3:30 approach I think is still in use by
3:33 well the subsequent derivation of that
3:36 company today then I worked for a more
3:38 goal in telecommunications doing the
3:41 very classical use case and template
3:43 communication which is called Trend
3:44 protection
3:45 and then I decided to pursue my ba now
3:47 first I think it was my masters and then
3:49 it was my PhD all of the stuff that I've
3:52 done was also kind of Applied statistics
3:54 machine learning
3:56 uh yeah and then I worked in a bunch of
3:59 places five different countries startup
4:02 setting freelance
4:05 uh yeah but Consulting uh
4:09 and now it's a very large I think the
4:11 best in the world software company
4:14 but um I think I think
4:19 um I have always done things which have
4:21 to do
4:22 with financial services mostly uh or
4:26 help
4:28 so basically if you put them together
4:30 it's well-being with a small kind of a
4:33 ship exception I've spent two and a half
4:34 years working for an airline it was very
4:37 romantic time I was living in the
4:39 airport it was incredible and uh yeah I
4:42 do not regret it in the slide it was
4:43 really been a little
4:45 kind of a separate experience was really
4:47 great what did you do they're also
4:49 related to data science for casting or
4:51 something else yeah it's the Germany
4:57 so uh you know uh and I was working
5:00 there first of the lead data scientist
5:02 and then I was working here basically no
5:05 not as part of the airline but in
5:07 consulting company which was working
5:09 with the airlines that was delivered
5:10 before
5:11 and
5:12 um yeah leading AI projects initiatives
5:15 and helping create personalized flight
5:19 experiences
5:21 so you did PhD you work with a startup
5:23 then you freelanced then you joined the
5:26 consultancy company and now you work in
5:29 a corporation that's like it right
5:31 everything right
5:33 I also did a postdoc it was also always
5:35 a dream of mine it's something that many
5:38 phds wants to do sometimes they want to
5:40 do it for a reason that they cannot
5:41 explain to themselves
5:43 so Alexey I also told you I think while
5:46 we're talking about preparation of this
5:48 schools that one of the
5:51 um podcast that you have made really
5:53 moved me and motivated me to speak which
5:56 was about the transition from Academia
5:58 to Industry
6:00 and this is also a story of my life as
6:03 which is as well as many other lives and
6:06 this is why you know if you have done a
6:09 PhD you want the postdoc you consider
6:11 this you do not really know why you just
6:14 want it and you go for it so it was it
6:16 was the story of my life I did not
6:17 regret it in the slightest I'm still
6:19 friends with all the people I used to
6:20 work with
6:21 and uh yeah it was a fantastic
6:23 experience
6:25 and by the way check it out this uh the
6:28 episode I was talking about was with CJ
6:31 CJ Jenkins I think and it was called
6:34 from Academia to data science was it but
6:38 I think it was uh like a cup of couple
6:40 of seasons ago check it out that was
6:42 indeed a cool one
6:43 and what was your PhD about
6:48 um it was about
6:55 uh precisely and this is important
6:58 because of uh you know you could have
7:01 many diseases that could be linked
7:04 to certain levels of air pollution so
7:07 they're not directly related but they
7:08 could be potentially linked I think it's
7:10 kind of sorry kind of a little bit of
7:12 common sense that uh if you have highly
7:15 polluted areas the propensity of Youth
7:18 you know basically somebody getting get
7:21 nil is is higher
7:23 uh so the idea was to create a
7:26 measurement method
7:28 to be able to come up with a kind of
7:32 pollution surface or to be able to
7:34 essentially precisely estimate the level
7:37 of air pollution at a given point and
7:40 thus be able to say what have would have
7:43 been the estimate of air pollution at a
7:45 certain place and the strength of this
7:47 was one of the interesting methods which
7:49 is called conformal predictions is that
7:52 instead of giving you a point estimated
7:54 it would give you an interval uh but it
7:56 would be a very uh how to say this very
8:00 valid and very reliable estimates so and
8:05 the more data you have obviously the
8:06 narrower your interval is so something
8:09 related to Bayesian statistics
8:13 you could do that as well but not
8:15 necessarily yes there was some parts of
8:18 uh underlying methods that use the
8:20 vision
8:21 so I haven't used the word in 75 years
8:23 but
8:25 um but um frequentists as well so it
8:28 didn't really have to be
8:31 yeah and what do you do now if you can
8:33 tell us what are you now
8:36 uh I
8:37 uh the team of people who is much
8:39 smarter than I am much more intelligent
8:41 and much more advanced in modern
8:43 Technologies
8:45 in in modern data science much more
8:47 diverse
8:49 so uh try to support them on
8:54 um
8:55 their way towards supporting our
8:57 customers
8:59 and uh making a positive impact and
9:03 especially positive business impact
9:05 working with our customers I mean the
9:07 customers of Microsoft are obviously are
9:09 very important
9:11 and we also work I don't really you know
9:15 I'm kind of I'm on this podcast today as
9:16 me not as a representation of my company
9:19 so everything I say I have to say this
9:21 is my own opinion it does not
9:22 necessarily reflect or does not
9:25 necessarily you know somehow
9:28 match the opinion of my employer but I'm
9:31 very proud to work there I have to say
9:33 because we're really I mean you know our
9:34 more toys to empower every person every
9:36 organization on the planet to achieve
9:38 more
9:39 and I'm just fascinated by how we work
9:41 with you know different sizes of
9:43 organizations from mobiles corporations
9:46 folks as 500 so folks have sorry 500
9:49 lists up to uh startups essentially so
9:53 uh I have people in my team who and me
9:56 included but I don't really spend enough
9:59 time on this as much as I would want to
10:01 is to support startup Founders and also
10:04 female Founders we have a program which
10:06 is called Microsoft for startups
10:08 so this is also something which is quite
10:10 cool but going back to what I do as well
10:14 is uh yeah essentially supporting my
10:16 team in uh driving the best and the most
10:19 meaningful business outcomes for our
10:20 customers with data science as well as
10:24 I'm responsible for business development
10:26 in specific regions in emea yeah and to
10:30 help Drive
10:32 Technology Innovation essentially and to
10:35 do the right thing with AI
10:37 and as I mentioned you're involved in
10:40 hiding rate so that's why we have this
10:43 conversation today yeah actually I have
10:45 been involved in hiring for the last I
10:47 would say
10:49 seven years
10:50 so I spend hiring data scientists about
10:52 about seven years time
10:54 so it's not has been uh it's not have
10:57 been a small Journey really
11:00 yeah just since you mentioned that I'm
11:02 really curious how the definition of a
11:04 data scientist changed over the seven
11:07 years was it was it the same seven years
11:09 ago or now the data scientists you hire
11:11 are completely different from the data
11:13 scientists you hired seven years ago
11:16 I depends Alexi because obviously if you
11:19 hire senior people they are from before
11:21 I think they are Mammon like you and I
11:23 who started studying thank you there's
11:25 no such thing as being designed so my
11:27 newest hire they graduated from data
11:29 science programs which are formally
11:31 called
11:32 data science programs when I started
11:34 there was no such thing
11:37 so I I started applied statistics you
11:39 know what did you study by the way
11:41 information Technologies
11:44 you see so there are so many different
11:46 walks of life from where people come to
11:48 become data scientists you know physics
11:50 all flavors of engineering Neuroscience
11:54 you know many social sciences as well so
11:57 uh yeah I think that sometimes so
12:00 basically seven years ago there was a
12:03 little bit of a kind of more
12:06 less expectations let's put it that way
12:08 less less expectations around what are
12:11 data scientists would do
12:14 uh but I guess
12:17 what has
12:19 State and variant is um kind of pursuit
12:22 of Excellence to be honest because of a
12:24 great data scientist back then is still
12:26 a greater scientist now
12:30 and uh yeah you can you could have been
12:33 excellent seven years ago and you could
12:35 be a still excellent or you could be
12:37 excellent now if it makes sense
12:39 yeah the thing I observed maybe it's
12:41 just my sample size is a bit biased but
12:44 what I saw is now there is more emphasis
12:47 on the engineering aspect of data
12:49 science and seven years ago eight years
12:51 ago the uh the focus was more on
12:54 mathematics and the mathematics behind
12:58 machine learning yeah yeah this is at
13:00 least what I observed but again I myself
13:04 was moving more into the engineering
13:07 Direction that's why maybe like just
13:10 thinks about me
13:12 changed but not the
13:14 uh environment let's say right I would
13:18 agree with that uh because of I think
13:20 that five seven years ago
13:22 years ago really to deploy for instance
13:24 we couldn't be even speaking about them
13:26 demos because we didn't really have
13:27 infrastructures to operationalize
13:29 whatever so we were trying you know
13:32 actually the notion of data science is
13:34 really really old if you think about so
13:36 for instance very I mean let's leave
13:39 alone Academia because they have been
13:41 doing this forever you know kind of
13:43 analyzing data and coming up with
13:45 inference based on that but if you look
13:47 into the industry for instance this
13:49 really old industry such as uh insurance
13:51 or for instance banking they have had
13:54 their Quant desks they have had their uh
13:57 analytics tests they have had their
13:59 Actuarial practitioners for very very
14:01 long time
14:03 50 years right for 50 years or yeah 30
14:06 years for sure longer than that so the
14:09 thing is that the thing is that to be
14:11 honest I mean what they do in data
14:13 science absolutely
14:15 were they putting it into fraud not
14:17 really so I mean
14:19 I remember seven years ago there was a
14:21 lot of use cases deployed in a local
14:22 machine this is true
14:25 but um nowadays it's definitely the
14:28 growth of computational Technologies and
14:30 the rise of cloud which you know kind of
14:32 I think boosted the whole thing and I
14:34 agree with you there is now a lot of
14:36 focus on engineering and also my honest
14:39 opinion is that it takes a village
14:41 to deliver AI sustainably it's just not
14:44 one person who knows like a bunch of
14:46 algorithms to be honest
14:49 and when now when you are hiring data
14:52 scientists when you are looking for a
14:54 data scientist what are the qualities
14:56 you're looking for typically there are
14:58 two things
14:59 things are very important
15:06 to join my current
15:08 job it was true for me when I was
15:10 working for another company
15:14 um two things essentially which are
15:16 pivotal for me one is technical skills
15:19 they have to be excellent really really
15:21 so this is something that you really
15:24 need to bring your hard skills with you
15:27 you really have to work on them if you
15:29 are feeling that you're not quite there
15:31 there is no reason for you not to get
15:32 there it's all the matter of practice
15:34 and studying oh what do you mean by
15:36 excellent technical skills like maybe
15:38 can you give an example because like
15:41 Great Python knowledge ability to solve
15:43 different algorithmic challenges or
15:46 that's a great question so what I mean
15:48 by great technical skills is essentially
15:52 I have to say this you know if you're a
15:54 professional chef you know that you're
15:55 good
15:57 obviously know how to chop an onion very
15:59 very well but you also know how to
16:01 create masterpieces with it
16:03 so
16:04 what I'm trying to say is that
16:06 essentially for me excellence and I
16:08 think it's something which cannot be
16:10 cataloged or you cannot really put a
16:13 definition on that but for me it
16:16 manifests in understanding very very
16:19 deeply what you do
16:21 so for me an excellent data scientist
16:24 can understand what the what the
16:27 solution does
16:28 on the level of underlying algorithm
16:31 that can really you know kind of plot it
16:34 write it uh describe it with
16:36 mathematical formula on a piece of paper
16:38 it could they could explain it very very
16:39 simple what it actually does and how it
16:41 does it and what would be the underlying
16:43 assumptions on data what would be the
16:45 risk so you know one of my favorite
16:47 interview questions for instance which I
16:49 ask a lot of people
16:51 uh is uh what does it mean what does it
16:54 mean of the data uh you know you know it
16:56 sounds you know it sounds sounds very
16:58 very kind of obvious but try it and you
17:00 will see so many interesting answers to
17:02 that and it gives you a lot of a lot of
17:04 kind of how to say
17:06 background of how people actually feel
17:08 what they do
17:10 then another thing which is very very
17:11 important for excellence is uh well
17:13 essentially practice so you have to have
17:15 a passion for this because if you don't
17:17 have a passion for this you will not be
17:19 able to practice this over a long time
17:20 and how they say practice makes perfect
17:23 there is no other way I mean there is no
17:26 degree of talent in my in my experience
17:28 that will compensate for lack of
17:30 practice
17:32 you know and it's something has to drive
17:34 you forward I mean it's obviously a
17:35 discipline but it's also practice
17:37 so yeah through practice their
17:41 understanding of what the thing does and
17:44 constant learning you eventually achieve
17:46 excellence
17:47 I guess this is pretty subjective and
17:50 when but when hiding you want to be
17:52 objective right so how do you check if
17:55 this person really has this deep
17:57 understanding of what they do uh I guess
18:00 you just ask questions hey what do you
18:02 do can you explain me right right so do
18:04 you mind and if I answer about the
18:06 second aspect of what I'm looking
18:07 because you say you asked me about what
18:10 yeah please so the first one was
18:12 technical right and the second attitude
18:16 attitude okay okay yeah
18:18 that's I think equally important or the
18:22 most important thing is the attitude
18:23 you have to be a Content learner you
18:26 have to know your worth you have to be
18:28 humble
18:29 you have to you know love it really
18:33 and also no I mean not precisely or at
18:37 least be honest with yourself where you
18:39 go into and what you're going to do
18:41 there try to find as much as possible so
18:43 are you going to work in a product now
18:45 you're going to work for the customers
18:46 are you going to work deeply in research
18:48 and then you know kind of
18:50 have the right approach to that
18:53 so how do you check love
18:55 yeah
18:57 you said like attitude is important and
18:59 people should love what they do yeah so
19:01 how do you check if they actually love
19:03 always there for the money it shows it
19:06 absolutely shows I mean passion is
19:08 something that you cannot really conceal
19:09 can you like maybe mention uh like how
19:13 we can manifest when you see that
19:16 the candidate doesn't
19:18 have this attitude or doesn't have this
19:22 love you talked about well I think and
19:24 again you absolutely right it's very
19:26 subjective I don't I'm not I'm not like
19:28 a guidebook on hiring to be honest I'm a
19:30 bunch of I'm curious but you don't have
19:32 to promise I promise you a fair share of
19:35 those experiences potentially some views
19:38 which will be corrected over time
19:40 because I'm wrong very often and then
19:43 like every human person and also it's a
19:45 collection of uh mistakes that I have
19:48 made but what is true for me nowadays I
19:51 think how do you check her attitude I
19:53 think you would ask about what I would
19:55 do I would ask about motivation why do
19:57 you do data science
19:59 I mean potentially no so directly but
20:02 you can ask a bunch of questions around
20:03 this to understand what is a person's
20:05 motivation to go to the field
20:08 you know so it would be behavioral
20:10 questions like tell me about the time
20:12 you did something right
20:14 this kind of questions let me try it so
20:17 Alex say why are you into data science
20:19 what makes you what makes you do this
20:21 podcast
20:23 okay I was not prepared for that I guess
20:28 meeting people like if we're talking
20:30 about this specific podcast meeting
20:31 people and learning from them learning
20:35 from you so right now I'm actually
20:37 taking notes so those who have watched
20:40 it in the video not listening I'm
20:42 showing now the notes I'm making and
20:44 then after this episode there will be a
20:47 transcription so I can go through this
20:49 transcription and really learn this
20:51 again and again so this is super useful
20:53 so with every episode with every guest I
20:56 learned something new so
20:58 yes that's one of the motivations
21:02 that sounds really good your question
21:04 was about data science right I'm still
21:06 not done do you mind if I if I
21:10 don't know so uh over the of the
21:12 episodes that you have conducted with
21:14 your guests what resonates most what has
21:16 I mean doesn't necessary has to apply to
21:19 people the topics the things I mean if I
21:22 would ask you
21:23 potentially wake you up in the middle of
21:25 the night and say Alexi what has been
21:27 what would have been the most
21:28 interesting topic so that have been the
21:30 most important to you that have been
21:32 discussed here what those have been yeah
21:34 usually those are around Curry here like
21:37 more soft topics rather than hard topics
21:40 not topics about like how gpt3 works but
21:44 more like uh like how you're progress in
21:47 your career like why are you doing what
21:49 you do or how you became
21:53 like what you are right now like the
21:57 career trajectory
21:58 different roles so this is the kind of
22:01 stuff I really like one of the recent
22:04 ones were like for example yesterday I
22:06 interviewed a person
22:08 about his experience of becoming a
22:10 Founder a company founder so he was
22:12 hacking like he was creating open source
22:14 and became a Founder so these are the
22:16 kind of episodes I did love
22:19 awesome that sounds really really good
22:21 and the last question around this what
22:25 have you learned during this exercise
22:27 this podcast what is that you have
22:29 learned about people about data
22:31 scientists about the human aspect
22:34 and that is a pretty broad question I
22:37 don't know
22:39 but the most important thing that's you
22:41 know kind of the sticks
22:43 people are interested everyone is
22:45 different
22:46 um yeah and everyone has a story to tell
22:48 yeah and it's funny when I reach out to
22:51 people say hey do you want to be on the
22:53 podcast and some of them say yeah but
22:56 there is nothing I can talk about but
22:58 then it's like the best podcast episode
23:00 right and then another almost last
23:03 question
23:06 on your reading list that the stuff that
23:09 you're reading right now what what is
23:11 the most prominent source of where you
23:13 get the news about the latest updates on
23:16 data science
23:17 yeah Twitter I guess so I check Twitter
23:20 and then if something gets a lot of
23:23 exposure on Twitter I look into this but
23:26 usually these are topics more around
23:28 engineering aspect of data science
23:30 rather than you know the latest trends
23:32 in AI I of course played with Dale it
23:36 was fun like I tried different prompts
23:38 you know what dala is right so you give
23:40 it a prompt and then it generates like
23:42 six nine pictures so Australian weird
23:45 stuff like
23:46 um
23:48 people like the guy from KFC is Colonel
23:51 Sanders right this you know this guy
23:54 um
23:55 he's from like the on the logo of KFC
23:57 like this fast food chain so I was
23:59 trying things like uh Colin Colonel
24:01 Sanders has he's having a zoom call with
24:04 puppies to take over McDonald's and then
24:06 it would Generate random pictures so
24:09 that was fun but yeah I'm just playing
24:11 with this kind of stuff but I I'm
24:13 reading more about like engineering
24:15 stuff yeah I see and this is why you
24:18 this is I I infer probably because you
24:20 have more passion for the engineering
24:22 aspect of data science rather than the
24:24 algorithmic one
24:25 and this is what you said that everybody
24:27 is different because some people like
24:28 myself for instance would be more driven
24:30 to potentially I mean I'm very much into
24:33 technological development but I'm very
24:36 mad the first thing when I read about
24:37 the new technology the first thing that
24:39 I try to infer for myself is how it
24:41 works under the hood so what is the
24:43 underlying method so today when you said
24:45 by each and I was like oh my God because
24:46 you know in potentially the level of
24:49 conversations that I normally have in my
24:51 daily job I do not often get asked about
24:53 it and that's a shame I mean I should
24:55 probably work I've made learning to
24:57 myself I probably should uh have more
24:59 such conversations because I really
25:01 really love that I just remember from my
25:04 University list when you have Point
25:06 estimate it's frequentists approach but
25:09 when you have a distribution that's
25:10 Bayesian that's why I thought okay like
25:12 let me show I'm smart you are you're
25:16 officially are stamp of approval
25:20 I think I asked you a question which you
25:23 kinda because like we were talking about
25:26 two things that you look at technical
25:27 skills and then attitudes right and then
25:30 I think both of these things are kind of
25:32 hard to measure they are more subjective
25:33 but there must be some objective way to
25:36 measure this right so attitude is more
25:38 like what you just tried on me right
25:40 asking these questions
25:42 uh what about technical skills like do
25:45 you also do this by asking questions
25:47 like hey tell me about the project you
25:49 did yeah you
25:54 know you had many many many many many
25:56 many many many many many many many many
25:57 many many many interviews a month
25:59 so uh this is something that you
26:02 eventually it's like muscle training you
26:04 get a lot of uh intuition just based on
26:07 the experience that you would have had
26:10 and uh like yourself I are very much
26:12 like getting to know people so for me
26:15 always the interview process as an
26:17 opportunity also for me to learn
26:19 from another person
26:21 where they come from what they have
26:23 learned in every time every time I have
26:25 an interview I learn something new
26:26 that's that's absolutely fascinating I
26:28 think it's the most rewarding
26:30 activity that you can do but um
26:33 I would be very cautious answering your
26:36 question because I you definitely do
26:38 have objective criterias and you have to
26:40 have objective criteria it's it's
26:42 absolutely mandatory and I will
26:44 elaborate on that in a second
26:46 however you must not forget that you
26:48 deal with people and people are not
26:51 necessarily always objective so I think
26:53 one of the policies of the data
26:55 scientists with or generally any
26:56 technical people I think if you move
26:58 into more kind of a softish discipline
27:00 is not to forget that you actually deal
27:02 with people
27:04 and not to expect them to follow you
27:06 know kind of a blueprint or kind of if
27:07 this then that approach it's with human
27:10 beings utterly wrong at least I think so
27:15 but on objective criteria so for
27:17 instance for me it has always been very
27:19 important to conduct a technical
27:20 interview you could have different
27:22 shapes of form of that it could have you
27:25 know kind of some code exercise it could
27:28 have some
27:30 you know kind of analytical exercise as
27:33 well and then you would ask a bunch of
27:35 questions
27:37 one of them is what does it mean
27:40 and it will also help you understand
27:42 very many
27:48 I think one of the thing that you need
27:50 to also remind yourself of or at least
27:53 die when I interview is to stay humble
27:55 and not kind of dig into places where I
27:58 know stuff
27:59 because if I can ask somebody if like
28:02 do their are there any kind of
28:05 distributions that wouldn't have like a
28:06 meal and then get a person completely
28:09 lost and frustrated during the interview
28:10 but I mean you also have in mind why I'm
28:13 asking this question so what do I want
28:15 to test what what do I expect this
28:17 person to be able to do to be successful
28:20 on this job
28:21 you know so this is important as well so
28:23 kind of also to prepare for your
28:25 technical interviews and be very
28:26 meaningful about what are you asking and
28:29 also at all the times respectful
28:31 so are there distributions that do not
28:33 have a mean yeah
28:35 sorry everyone shouldn't have upset
28:40 like what are those distributions I
28:43 invite you to check Wikipedia
28:48 what was the most interesting
28:50 answer you got when you asked about the
28:53 mean
28:55 the most interesting answer
28:57 yeah
28:59 okay because I would just answer it's
29:00 average right just to you know dot
29:03 meaning do you do you really want to go
29:05 there
29:08 all right no but I mean interesting
29:11 answer so I think when you say
29:12 interesting you mean something that has
29:15 stuck with me you reply right unusual
29:17 something you remember yes yeah so I
29:20 remember a person who we hired
29:22 answered on that question and they Sorry
29:25 answered that question and they were
29:26 very specific in their ramsa because
29:30 they also you know kind of they give
29:31 they have given kind of a textbook
29:33 definition of a mean or an average of
29:36 the data they have provided an example
29:38 of potentially how you measure this in
29:40 the sample
29:41 uh they have provided an example of how
29:43 it extrapolates to whatever population
29:45 you would take the sample from and then
29:48 they have a provide another practical
29:50 example of uh how this
29:53 applies to life you know this was really
29:56 really good it was really impressive for
29:58 me and uh yeah I was like
30:00 yeah that's pretty expensive the depths
30:03 of the knowledge you know for instance
30:04 one of the ways for instance how you
30:06 could ask about me now for instance if
30:07 you're still not convinced with my
30:09 favorite question
30:10 is a um you could ask somebody let's
30:13 assume
30:14 you want to move to a new country which
30:17 you know nothing about and like there
30:19 for instance their currency also says
30:21 nothing to you
30:23 I mean you can obviously check it at
30:25 places like xd.com but I mean you would
30:28 not lived it and it will be no kind of
30:30 something which
30:31 you know kind of will be natural to you
30:33 to operate in in in this in this
30:36 environment and then you would want to
30:38 buy around the house
30:40 and then you would definitely want to
30:43 know for the potentially which
30:44 neighborhood and stuff like that you
30:45 would want to know the average level of
30:47 prices
30:48 you know in this neighborhood or in this
30:51 country so basically what would be the
30:53 main statistics what would be the
30:55 mean essentially and what would be the
30:57 deviations of that and stuff like that
30:59 so in a human level that makes a lot of
31:01 sense right to be to to know to know why
31:04 you want to know this
31:06 and this gives you an understanding
31:08 essentially essentially why you want to
31:09 know this and what this means
31:11 and how it translates
31:13 okay interesting no one of the things
31:16 also maybe it's because I want to start
31:18 a session one of the things is that
31:20 people very much kind of talk about
31:22 predictive statistics and like cognitive
31:25 what not prescriptive this is very very
31:27 important definitely but one should not
31:31 underestimate the power of descriptive
31:33 statistics
31:35 it's when you know when I started
31:36 mathematics they told me it's Elemental
31:38 not because it's simple it's Elemental
31:40 because it's their elements from which
31:42 other more complex things are
31:44 constructed
31:47 statistics is like all this mean median
31:51 all this kind of
31:52 characteristics of data of the sample
31:54 you have right descriptive statistics
31:57 are the statistics that describe the
31:58 data
32:00 my statistics is a bit trusty
32:03 so I know how to fit and predict in
32:05 psychic learn
32:06 but if you started
32:09 you should be able to understand what
32:11 the data tells before yeah
32:15 I'll take a refresher I guess after this
32:17 conversation I take it all the time
32:20 because I forget stuff and then when I
32:22 have the time I would just read old
32:23 books like for instance
32:25 of statistical learning I think that's a
32:29 good one I have it it's a very good one
32:31 okay so we since we talked a bit about
32:35 statistics and math so what do you think
32:37 what is more important strong
32:39 mathematical background or strong
32:41 engineering background
32:43 when we hire people or we just hire both
32:46 or how do we decide
32:49 um
32:50 it's a very interesting question uh I
32:53 think it depends on what you want to
32:54 achieve
32:55 but let's say you have a team and you
32:58 want to hire data scientists for the
33:00 team and you have some objective like
33:02 there is a product you want to add
33:04 artificial intelligence machine learning
33:06 to this product and now you have a task
33:08 to hire three data scientists right so
33:13 how do you decide if you want to get
33:15 people with who has a stronger
33:17 mathematical background or who are more
33:20 like stronger Engineers let's say you
33:23 know when I data scientists I need to or
33:26 I need to be able to very very
33:28 disambiguously know what I want them to
33:30 do
33:31 because you know just today we have had
33:33 a team meeting and we discussed things
33:34 that are scope of data science work
33:37 recently because of its emerging
33:39 discipline still has been very Broad and
33:42 it doesn't always you know play as a
33:44 favor for data scientists because of uh
33:46 you know in in German there is a concept
33:48 of kind of ayaligan the Vol milisao you
33:51 know a kind of a
33:53 very interesting animal so it's
33:55 essentially a pig which also gives a
33:58 wool and also gives milk and also gives
34:01 eggs you know so we should avoid having
34:04 a data I mean you more polite way to
34:06 call this is a Swiss army knife but none
34:09 of them actually or another way to call
34:11 it Jack of all trades but being that
34:14 person is really no fun
34:16 honestly you know and this is kind of
34:20 also difficulty to kind of retain
34:22 somebody like this for you in the long
34:24 run because if you kind of expect the
34:25 person to be able to do everything I say
34:28 yeah whatever you you can so you have to
34:30 so it's not necessarily
34:31 not necessarily fun to be that person
34:34 okay so you have to be very very
34:37 specific when you want to hire data
34:38 scientist you have to be very very
34:40 specific what do you expect them to
34:41 actually do
34:43 okay and if this uh if what you expect
34:46 is integrating with the back end of
34:49 whatever the existing team is doing then
34:52 it's probably more engineering but if
34:54 you expect them to do more analytics
34:56 more talking to business then it's
34:58 probably more on the other side of
35:00 spectrum right yeah let's assume you're
35:03 a startup and your is really limited so
35:06 you want to deploy a very specific use
35:07 case and then you already have a couple
35:09 of people let's let's let's say with no
35:12 lack of generality your language is
35:13 Python and you have everything and then
35:16 for instance you would want somebody who
35:17 will have like a deep understanding of
35:19 underlying algorithm and we'll be able
35:21 to develop a custom solution and who
35:24 will be able to put it into Broad and
35:25 ensure that it's not just kind of
35:27 something that works in the research
35:28 environment that kind of runs in real
35:30 time is for realizable and so forth so
35:32 you would expect this person to
35:34 understand how this works how this could
35:36 be parallelizable but potentially you
35:39 would also be if you already have a
35:41 couple of very very good software
35:43 engineers
35:44 you will be able you will be willing to
35:46 potentially
35:48 forgive the floor forgive us the wrong
35:50 word but kind of accept if this person's
35:53 potentially coding skills I know that
35:56 part with those of the professional
35:57 software engineer and actually generally
36:00 for a data scientist an expectation
36:02 should not be that they should be an
36:04 awesome
36:05 software Engineers because it's not
36:07 their job I mean they can be I have met
36:09 people who are and have have a respect
36:11 for them to be honest
36:13 I'm not one of them and uh definitely
36:16 unfortunately but um on the mask because
36:19 you would also have expectations of kind
36:21 of very deep understanding of algorithm
36:23 what the underlying thing does
36:26 and how it basically stems from the data
36:29 landscape that you have what kind of
36:31 data you have to have you would not
36:33 expect this person to be tremendous
36:35 programming they can write a lot of the
36:37 research food and that's okay well it's
36:39 commented
36:40 yeah so if you need uh somebody with
36:44 strong genius skills just hire a
36:45 developerate not a data scientist
36:51 to be able to productionalize
36:54 if you need a solution that essentially
36:57 you know kind of for me for you it will
36:59 be more important the engineering aspect
37:01 then you would look for somebody who has
37:03 a understanding of underlying data
37:06 science methods but not necessarily so
37:08 well versed in kind of different
37:11 underlying algorithms who has their
37:14 understanding for potentially a little
37:16 bit basic of how
37:18 the mathematics under the hood works but
37:21 then you would need them to really
37:22 really be good in programming it's it's
37:24 also fine
37:25 it depends on it depends on what the
37:27 business needs
37:29 we have quite a few questions I know
37:31 from the questions I prepared we covered
37:33 only two out of five I don't know how
37:35 many but yeah I think it's uh it's time
37:39 we also took a look at the questions
37:42 um no audience and the first question is
37:44 from Ilia so Elia is asking when automl
37:47 will replace humans and hiring data
37:49 scientists will not be necessary anymore
37:51 never never why
37:55 [Laughter]
37:58 well because of the human aspect you
38:01 know there is a fantastic book
38:03 uh which is called human and AI
38:06 which is written by Accenture Chief
38:08 technology officer I think around 2015
38:10 and it talks about the professions of
38:13 the future so-called I mean definitely
38:15 AI is developing automl is tremendously
38:19 powerful and it grows its power day by
38:21 day and this is good because we also
38:23 want to and also for instance you know
38:27 some kind of also no code environment
38:29 such as for instance different designers
38:31 they're also fantastic because they
38:33 enabled so-called citizen data science
38:36 and this is a very very right way to go
38:38 because you will have some of the
38:40 solutions really robustly tested and
38:43 safe
38:44 for a person with no degree in advanced
38:47 mathematics to be able to safely use for
38:49 the goals you know to be able to meet
38:51 the goals of the business
38:53 but you would never this is what we
38:56 discussed in the beginning it it's that
38:59 data science is a first and foremost
39:01 people
39:02 you would never be able to replace the
39:05 human environment and this is why you
39:07 would always because you do things for
39:10 humans essentially
39:12 so this is why I think it's never I
39:14 think that you would always it is I'm
39:16 not like a futurist but I think it's uh
39:18 you would always
39:21 I think one of the reasons one of the
39:24 most common reasons that data science
39:26 and machine learning project fails is
39:28 misalignment miscommunication between
39:30 different like between the stakeholders
39:32 the product people from the product the
39:34 users and the data scientists who
39:36 implement the solution
39:38 so you have to have this conversation
39:40 you have to have this communication with
39:43 others in order to do what is the right
39:46 thing to do right and if now you replace
39:48 data scientists who are okay with
39:51 communication maybe not the best ones
39:53 but okay with machines who do not
39:56 communicate at all who expect clean data
39:58 then of course it will not work we still
40:01 need communication right so AI will not
40:05 magically solve all the problems of your
40:07 users you know there's
40:10 there is summation possible for data
40:11 quality checks as well so
40:13 it's not about that it's what you said
40:15 about the delivery of a deployment of an
40:18 AI project or any project
40:21 the most important thing is Vitamin C
40:24 which is a communication
40:26 and this is not my finding this I read
40:28 it in a book there is a woman from Spain
40:31 her name is
40:32 and she is the first woman who has Clan
40:36 Mount Everest
40:38 and she wrote a book about this and she
40:41 I I love this book and I think one of
40:45 the things which resonated with me most
40:47 was essentially she provided examples
40:48 with lack of vitamin C
40:50 was leading to all kinds of people
40:52 literally died
40:55 going up so uh this is pivotal that
40:58 people communicate really
41:01 and this is why I think that you would
41:05 always always need
41:08 people
41:09 mm-hmm
41:11 yeah some things you can automate some
41:13 things but automl aims at simplifying
41:16 the work of data scientists exactly
41:22 simplifying the work that you are doing
41:24 because before you would spend a lot of
41:26 time you know trying and testing
41:28 different algorithms but then
41:30 but then now you have opportunity to
41:32 kind of have the machine do this for you
41:34 very very quickly and then save a lot of
41:37 your time and energy but it's the same
41:39 like before we all used to wash the
41:41 dishes by hand and now we all have
41:43 dishwashers
41:46 yeah I recently discovered the beauty of
41:48 having a dishwasher
41:50 do you know how to start it yeah and we
41:53 had a dishwasher we have had it for like
41:55 eight years
41:56 I just didn't know how to turn it on
41:59 but recently uh so my life will never be
42:02 the same now
42:04 because I know how to turn it on now
42:08 anyways uh an interesting question
42:12 um so personally I am good at data
42:13 science but my manager wants me to do a
42:16 course in management which I feel is not
42:18 relevant for me since my passion is in
42:20 data science so do you have any
42:22 suggestions
42:24 um for people in this situation like
42:26 what they can do to well let's say you
42:29 don't want to become a manager but
42:31 you're your your boss is kind of trying
42:34 to push you a little bit in this
42:35 direction saying hey we need managers
42:37 who want to grow the team
42:40 I think it's a vitamin C thing I think
42:42 it's to have an honors conversation with
42:44 your manager I understand basically
42:45 where they are coming from
42:47 you know to understand what is their
42:49 motivation why you're pushing you you
42:51 know you to do that what they wanted to
42:54 do because potentially they want you to
42:55 really lead a team do they want you to
42:57 take more responsibility
42:59 uh and essentially why you because
43:02 essentially if you don't want to
43:04 you don't have to
43:06 that's the thing because of uh the
43:09 career path of a data scientist this is
43:11 very very hot and acute topic and people
43:13 expect
43:14 some kind of blueprints which will be
43:16 robustly tested in this and it's not
43:18 possible because the discipline
43:19 especially in the industry it exists for
43:21 about like seven years
43:23 a little bit more maybe
43:25 but um you still don't have enough
43:27 examples of people who would reach kind
43:30 of sea level positions I mean there are
43:33 but they are not as many as you would
43:36 have potential in engineering to be able
43:38 to understand what your options would be
43:41 because of in many environments people
43:43 assume automatically that the only way
43:45 up is through management when you start
43:48 managing I mean boss likes to say which
43:51 I really really like
43:52 quoting he says everybody can be a
43:56 leader but not everybody can be a
43:57 manager
43:59 and you know extending this code I would
44:01 say not everybody has to and it's
44:03 absolutely fine you you don't have to
44:05 manage people to to be a data science
44:07 leader because you have also had to
44:09 understand how also understand one thing
44:11 there is a certain it's physics it's the
44:14 law of conservation of energy right so
44:16 in order to
44:18 for you to kind of give more to
44:20 something you would have to take this
44:22 energy from somewhere else right in
44:25 so if you manage people if you spend
44:28 time for instance in business meetings
44:29 also for them and you're less Hands-On
44:31 and you lose touch the technology you
44:33 lose touch to I mean you practice your
44:35 craft much less if at all so it's also
44:37 something that you have to take into
44:39 consideration so it's not just
44:42 um
44:43 it's it's essentially a matter of what
44:45 you do in your life you know
44:47 so yeah going back to this example I
44:49 would have an honest conversation and
44:51 try to understand where the man just
44:52 coming from and then provide an
44:54 alternative solution to say look
44:56 potentially if I do this
44:58 you will lose a great data scientist
45:00 because I will kind of lose my my
45:02 practice
45:04 and then are you ready to do this are
45:06 you willing to do this does it go well
45:07 with the goals of organization because
45:09 maybe there is a certain solution you
45:10 can hire somebody else to be a team lead
45:12 unless this person to be you know kind
45:15 of advanced as a uh manager specialist
45:18 to however you call them a new
45:20 organization but kind of a senior
45:22 responsible person for a technology or
45:25 something like this
45:27 so the risk for the company here is to
45:29 lose a great data scientist but maybe
45:32 get a an average manager all right
45:35 precise
45:36 okay
45:37 so the company should really think about
45:39 this
45:41 and okay fair enough
45:43 um
45:44 how hard would it be to switch from data
45:47 analysts to from data analysts to data
45:50 scientists
45:52 depends
45:56 uh depends on like the company where you
45:58 work or depends on what you call data
46:01 scientist a definition you have in your
46:03 head for this scientists right I guess
46:06 on your background I mean it also what
46:08 kind of data scientists do you want to
46:09 be
46:10 depends
46:12 yeah there are different like there are
46:14 data scientists who are more lenient
46:16 towards you know business side of things
46:18 and then from analytics I think that the
46:21 speech is not that difficult right and
46:23 there are data scientists who are more
46:24 into envelopes and engineering and then
46:27 it would require I don't know taking
46:29 coding classes or something like this
46:31 right or getting practice
46:35 as well but also understand underlying
46:37 mathematics
46:39 yeah right
46:41 so it depends on how how well versed
46:44 people are already in this so what will
46:47 be you can learn anything because we all
46:49 learned I mean this is something which
46:51 is very very important like what makes a
46:52 great data science a great education and
46:55 then turns out any hours of practice you
46:57 know how they say that you have to put
46:59 in order to become an expert in
47:00 something you have to put this ten
47:01 thousand hours of practice give or take
47:06 yeah one thing I wanted to talk to you
47:08 about also was one of the things you
47:11 mentioned when we just started this
47:13 conversation about uh inviting you to
47:16 this podcast you mentioned that you
47:18 managed to attract a significant share
47:20 of excellent excellent female candidates
47:22 with excellent female talents to your
47:25 team yeah and I thought about this and
47:29 I'm also hiring I'm a part of hiring
47:31 process I'm a hiring manager I also take
47:34 part in hiring as an interviewer and I
47:37 do not see many females in the
47:39 candidates so maybe the ratio is 91 so
47:43 90 males and only one uh one only ten
47:47 percent females so yeah
47:50 sorry what do you mean by when you see
47:52 that you don't see them
47:53 yeah that's uh when people apply
47:56 mostly it's males
47:58 so I'm really curious how you managed to
48:01 to get a significant share of female
48:04 candidates and female talents now I'm
48:07 gonna speak I guess on this
48:14 Sunday probably I will get open the
48:15 gates of hell but you know what I guess
48:17 that's the truth and it's it has to be
48:19 spoken
48:20 it's very very hard I mean it's much
48:22 it's easier for us now but it's
48:23 generally very very hard for us women in
48:25 in stem
48:28 because the buyers against us is
48:30 systemic
48:31 and it's more pronounced than one
48:34 Society isn't less pronounced than other
48:36 societies but if you focus on this
48:39 uh a little bit more and you would see
48:43 that for instance when Voice start you
48:46 know kind of developing and growing up
48:47 they are almost encouraged and it's
48:49 integrated to go into things such as
48:51 engineering
48:52 you know or mathematics or physics
48:55 whereas girls are more expected and it's
48:58 social pressure to prioritize stuff like
49:00 liberal arts which is a very honorable
49:03 discipline
49:05 and care but um there are not too many
49:09 girls who would choose mathematics so
49:11 partially I mean I would I would be
49:13 absolutely honest some some women just
49:15 don't care they're not interested in it
49:16 really and it's all right because some
49:18 people you know they're interested in
49:20 literature some people are interested
49:22 you know in history some people are
49:24 interested in music it's so right to not
49:25 care about mathematics or engineering
49:28 but it has nothing to do with gender but
49:30 a lot with a social kind of pressure and
49:32 the expectation and also what kind of
49:34 people intake from their families
49:37 which have also been brought up by
49:39 generations of people thinking things a
49:41 certain way
49:43 so it's not potentially some one person
49:45 to be yeah I think I know what you're
49:47 talking about in my group when I was
49:49 studying at University there was only
49:50 one girl
49:51 in a group of 25 people
49:54 when I started we had 25 percent of
49:57 females
49:59 right and I think it was quite a lot uh
50:02 and uh what I wanted to say but then
50:05 later on something that happens it also
50:08 kind of girls the uh how to say a little
50:11 bit overseen
50:12 also oftentimes in not all the times but
50:16 oftentimes when they study because they
50:19 are not expected to have a certain level
50:21 of ability or dedication or whatnot I
50:24 have not encountered this myself but I
50:26 had my friends who told me that they
50:29 personally have encountered this
50:32 discrimination I would say based on the
50:34 agenda they would say you would never
50:35 attain certain Heights because you're a
50:37 woman directly or indirectly
50:40 and uh also
50:42 it becomes increased increasingly
50:45 difficult for learning when they enter
50:46 the workforce because there are many
50:47 biases such as for instance like like
50:49 bias so you would normally unconsciously
50:52 be prone to like people who are more
50:55 similar to you because you feel safer
50:57 around your let's say for only people
51:00 who who look like you who are like you
51:03 and this is why if you go to an
51:05 assessment center or to a company and
51:07 it's populated with males
51:10 that's it they're going to basically say
51:12 yeah this is a safer Choice
51:13 unconsciously with all the best
51:15 intentions in the world so if you want
51:17 to be able to attract diverse talents
51:19 basically people who are different from
51:21 you
51:22 you should potentially shift a little
51:24 bit your mindset and also be more open
51:26 and be more willing to understand where
51:28 other people are coming from
51:31 and then what is important to them
51:34 yeah and that also applies to to women
51:37 essentially
51:38 another thing which is important to do
51:40 is knowing knowing that there are more
51:43 males and female and the system is
51:45 skewed so it's kind of a male prevalence
51:48 in in this industry is to apply more
51:52 effort because of our I have seen a lot
51:55 of people kind of expecting that
51:57 somebody all out of the blue will Source
52:00 them outstanding female talent and just
52:02 say look you choose
52:04 doesn't really work like this so you
52:07 have to be able to go on a limb and go
52:10 and search for these people and you go
52:11 search LinkedIn you search your weak
52:14 ties this is actually one of the best
52:16 ways because of our
52:18 you know kind of application through
52:20 reference or hiring through a reference
52:21 and my experience works really well
52:23 because if you know people who are
52:25 excellent chances are the people from
52:26 their surrounding are also excellent
52:29 you know and then you can just basically
52:32 ask and say hey do you know any
52:34 excellent female data scientists who are
52:36 now looking for a job because the last
52:38 very important thing which is also very
52:40 important to mention is that there is a
52:42 research and I don't want the sound that
52:44 I'm against man or anything I promise
52:46 I'm not but one thing also to say that
52:49 there is a research which shows that a
52:52 woman would apply or feel secure to
52:54 apply for a job only and when she takes
52:57 100 of the requirement boxes
53:00 a male is known to be able to kind of go
53:03 with it when they take around 60 of
53:08 boxes
53:10 you know so you would really need to
53:12 empower encourage potentially sometimes
53:15 convinced and help somebody also boost
53:17 their self-confidence because guess what
53:20 the self-confidence has been unboosted
53:22 over generations for years so I'm in
53:25 life
53:26 and and the technical knowledge and uh
53:28 you know it's actually brilliant and
53:30 then women are also excellent in the
53:32 kind of uh how to say that in many
53:34 things I mean everybody's every person
53:36 is a different world you can just
53:37 basically attribute some qualities to a
53:39 man or a woman and I say this with my
53:41 shallow knowledge of psychology but
53:45 um and mass what I have seen that women
53:47 are really really good in organizing
53:49 work
53:52 you know and yeah one of the questions I
53:55 wanted to ask is how to make job
53:57 descriptions more attractive to female
53:59 candidates I think you partly answered
54:01 that question is by citing This research
54:04 that might apply with women apply when
54:07 they take 100 of the boxes but when
54:10 apply when it's 60 so maybe one of the
54:13 things that we can do is when coming up
54:16 with a job description list only the
54:18 skills that are absolutely necessary
54:19 right
54:20 so and I meet all the nice to have ones
54:24 right yeah I think that's always a good
54:27 approach but it's my personal opinion
54:28 because
54:32 who could do the job really well there
54:34 is no such thing as a perfect candidate
54:36 you should also be very very Frank with
54:39 yourself what do you absolutely need a
54:41 person to bring with and what they can
54:44 learn in the job and you have to
54:45 facilitate the resources for them to
54:47 learn on the job as well
54:49 but I guess yes you don't want to end up
54:51 hiring an Aya league in the world
54:53 militia because if it's not sustainable
54:55 and they're not can you remind what it
54:57 is it's like a Swiss army knife right
54:59 it's a jack of all trades yes yes yeah
55:03 so you would want to basically my my
55:06 suggestion is always to boil it down to
55:08 what you actually need this person to do
55:11 and be able to do
55:13 yeah I came across a startup or company
55:17 so what they do they offer is you can
55:20 upload a CV or job description sorry and
55:23 in this job description they will
55:25 highlight things that say that okay if
55:28 you include this word it will
55:31 um like discourage female candidates to
55:34 apply it consider replacing it with a
55:36 different like if with a synonym so do
55:38 you think it works like is it how it
55:41 actually works I was quite surprised
55:43 when I saw this it was like replacing
55:46 wine synonym by another and then just
55:48 say okay like if you do this then you
55:50 increase chances of getting more female
55:52 candidates I think it does I think
55:54 generally it does yes because I believe
55:56 that there are some wordings which feel
55:58 more kind of okay
56:01 you know appealing potentially generally
56:05 and I would not say you know if you just
56:07 try this and if you rewrite your your uh
56:11 job description
56:13 you would also find it more appealing to
56:14 men
56:15 because normally it will suggest that
56:17 you focus on things such as
56:18 collaboration
56:20 Spirit you know psychological safety and
56:24 I don't know I mean the person of any
56:25 gender who would not like that
56:30 yeah I see we don't have a lot of time
56:33 left and I know you need to go at 6 30.
56:37 so maybe I don't know if you can answer
56:39 that quickly but maybe you can try will
56:42 you consider a person who has a gap of
56:44 six years while hiring yes why not why
56:48 not
56:49 well because of the Gap what maybe you
56:51 think okay they don't have the skills
56:54 that I needed or at least I like let's
56:57 say if I have a gap I might think this
56:59 way that the hiring manager would not
57:02 think I'm I have the same level of
57:05 skills as the person who just graduated
57:07 from a data science boot camp or
57:09 something or not boot camp like
57:10 University or whatever you know the
57:13 reason why people take gaps in their
57:15 career very very different and
57:16 oftentimes they have nothing to do with
57:18 the uh their ability to do things
57:22 for example right for women
57:25 and not only for women I mean for
57:28 instance I know people who are men who
57:30 have taken
57:31 gaps not six years just to take care of
57:35 their families because they had
57:37 this is a normal I mean life happens
57:41 but I don't think that it's basically
57:43 anyhow reflects on their skills
57:44 absolutely not
57:47 but can we maybe have a tip for them to
57:51 feel better or more secure when applying
57:54 when you have a gap how can you uh you
57:58 know feel better about it and then just
58:01 keep applying
58:03 I guess that's what you said it's keep
58:05 applying and believe in yourself
58:06 I mean the thing is that I can tell you
58:08 a lot of encouraging things but the
58:10 thing is that
58:12 it's on everybody to believe in
58:14 themselves
58:16 you you kind of yeah it's scary it's out
58:19 there absolutely you know I feel
58:21 insecure or kind of anxious or
58:23 vulnerable like many times
58:26 often and frequently because I'm a human
58:29 being and it's a part of the human
58:30 experience but in the end of the day you
58:33 just think okay I already have a no
58:37 as a baseline what do I have to lose
58:40 that somebody basically makes a judgment
58:43 about my God
58:45 it's on them really I don't have to I
58:47 don't have to inherit this I don't have
58:49 to you know kind of absorb that
58:51 okay there is a small request for you
58:54 can you type the German word you said
58:58 because I don't know where because
59:02 it's slowly
59:06 now you know what I'm going to do I'm
59:07 going to do this in the YouTube
59:10 um comment
59:11 okay all right
59:13 yes that is all right so uh please check
59:16 the comment section after the call the
59:19 word will be there okay I think that's
59:21 all uh thanks a lot for joining us
59:23 thanks a lot for sharing your expertise
59:25 with us we didn't cover most of the
59:27 questions I prepared but that's okay I
59:29 guess because the conversation we had
59:31 was really nice thanks for asking me
59:33 questions this is not something hap that
59:35 happens quite often
59:36 and yeah thanks and thanks everyone for
59:39 joining us today
59:40 many thanks Alexey for having me and
59:43 many thanks everyone for the questions
59:45 and the comments I will definitely look
59:47 at them again and feel free to post more
59:50 questions that we'll try to answer them
59:52 offline in video
59:54 okay awesome thank you very much have a
59:57 great rest of everybody
