0:00 Um hi everyone uh thanks for joining us
0:02 today. This event is brought to you by
0:04 data talks club which is a community of
0:06 people who love data. We host weekly
0:08 events. Today is one of such events.
0:10 Although it's a bit of on unusual day we
0:14 typically have them on Tuesday and
0:15 Monday on on Tuesdays and Fridays not on

1:09 you ready Mark?
1:10 I'm ready. Let's do it.
1:12 So I'm also almost ready. Just one
1:15 second.
1:17 Yeah. So this week we will go about the
1:20 role of a chief data scientist of chief
1:22 data officer sorry and we have a special
1:25 guest today Marco. Marco is the chief
1:28 data officer at Olix Group. Olex group
1:30 this is the place where I work as well.
1:32 So we are colleagues before Olix. Marco
1:35 worked at Spotify, Twitter, Facebook. I
1:37 probably miss a couple of companies. You
1:39 also have a PhD right? Uh yeah. Um so
1:44 yeah welcome Marco.
1:46 Thank you very much. Thanks for having
1:47 me. Excited to be here. Um and and to be
1:50 a part of this community as well. So,
1:52 thank you very much. And sorry that I I
1:53 I shifted dates around a little bit.
1:56 Thank you for your your flexibility and
1:58 then I hope we still get a good audience
1:59 today despite it not being on Tuesday or
2:02 Friday.
2:03 It's uh I anticipated that it would be
2:05 difficult uh to schedule a meeting with
2:08 uh the co. So anyways, so before we go
2:12 into our main topic of the role of a
2:15 chief data officer, let's start with
2:17 your background. So can I can you tell
2:20 um us about your career journey so far?
2:22 Sure, happy to do so. I I'll start all
2:25 the way back. Um so I have a degree in
2:27 computer science. I'm Portuguese, grew
2:30 up in in Portugal. Um got a degree in uh
2:33 computer science and then I realized
2:36 that I like people more than I like
2:38 computers. And I hope I don't offend
2:40 anyone with this. Uh which made me um
2:42 move more into trying to understand
2:44 people and how they use computers
2:46 because I still love technology uh more
2:48 so than just spending all my time with
2:50 technology. And because of that I ended
2:52 up getting a masters in information
2:54 systems which was a way of getting
2:56 information about how people are
2:58 interacting with systems quickly uh
3:01 which is now called data science. So
3:02 it's a long time ago and then ended up
3:05 uh getting a PhD in related topics also
3:08 moving towards the the more qualitative
3:11 understanding of users as well through
3:12 user research a variety of insights
3:15 disciplines. So, so that's a little bit
3:16 of my academic background. Had a lot of
3:18 fun. Worked on uh quite a few different
3:20 areas during uh my studies and then
3:23 ended up um moving to the US where I
3:26 joined Yahoo and I worked as a research
3:28 scientist that included quite a bit of
3:31 data science, pulling data, making sense
3:33 of it, understanding opportunities for
3:36 us to build innovation primarily there.
3:39 uh quite detached to be totally
3:41 transparent from the product development
3:42 that was happening in the company and
3:44 looking uh quite a bit further ahead. So
3:47 5 10 years out. So I worked on things
3:49 like augmented reality on mobile
3:52 devices. This was over 10 years ago
3:54 before Pokemon Go and all of those
3:57 things uh came about. Live video
3:59 production before Periscope existed. uh
4:02 and a bunch of fun projects but again
4:04 the goal was to publish write patents
4:06 which was fun but not a lot of impact.
4:08 So I ended up moving to Facebook at the
4:11 time had less than one billion users.
4:14 Worked a lot on trying to understand how
4:16 can you we expand on the the products
4:18 that we have. Uh how can we build more
4:21 value for our users? Again leveraging
4:24 both qualitative and quantitative
4:26 quantitative data and and figuring out
4:28 how can we solve user problems in the
4:30 best possible way uh through technology
4:33 through software and uh design of it as
4:36 well. and um yeah, had a lot of fun.
4:38 Stayed there for a couple years, then
4:40 ended up moving to uh Twitter to
4:43 continue doing the same thing, but then
4:44 scaling up my impact through management
4:47 and and building teams. I spent a few
4:49 years at Twitter. Uh all of this was in
4:52 the Bay Area. And then eventually I
4:54 moved and I on Twitter I worked on a
4:56 variety of things all the way from you
4:58 know the launch of a um ranked timeline
5:02 that leveraged ML to uh organize and
5:05 rank tweets based on someone's interests
5:08 versus the typical reverse chronology
5:10 which is a pretty controversial move by
5:13 Twitter but ended up working really well
5:15 and and it's still maintained. Um and
5:17 then I ended up moving to Spotify in New
5:20 York where I also led a bunch of data
5:22 science teams, marketing insights,
5:24 started to build marketing analytics,
5:26 user research, uh and a variety of other
5:29 growth strategy and a few other
5:31 disciplines always with this goal of how
5:34 can we use data to make smart and
5:36 informed decisions that are going to
5:37 benefit our users. And um I think nine
5:41 or so months ago I uh moved back from
5:44 the US to uh Europe and I joined the Ox
5:47 group where I I have the role of uh
5:50 chief data officer. So it's been a a fun
5:52 journey so far.
5:54 Yeah. Thanks. Quite a quite a journey.
5:57 And uh you I don't I haven't met many
6:00 people who say that they like people
6:02 more than computers. So usually it's the
6:05 opposite.
6:06 Indeed. Yeah.
6:07 Yeah. Um so can you tell us what do you
6:10 do you do at Relix as a chief data
6:12 officer? Yeah. So, um a chief head
6:15 officer is a fairly new role um across
6:19 not just within OX but across our
6:22 industries. Um and it's still being
6:25 defined as we go. But in my case um I'm
6:29 responsible for defining our broad data
6:32 strategy and and that includes quite a
6:34 few pillars all the way from data
6:37 infrastructure and our governance to um
6:41 you know what kind of data do we need
6:43 for us to continue expanding on our
6:45 business and the value that we bring to
6:48 our users. uh all the way to how do we
6:51 make sense of that data and make it
6:52 accessible across the different
6:54 organizations that are part of our
6:56 group. How do we leverage that data to
6:58 make better products through
7:00 technologies such as artificial
7:02 intelligence, machine learning, and
7:04 overall working with the different
7:06 business lines, business units, teams
7:08 that we have across the group to to make
7:10 sure that we're prepared for the future
7:12 and we're delivering the best possible
7:14 value for our users and anticipating
7:16 needs that they might have. M it's quite
7:19 a lot of things.
7:22 Yeah. So I I was also wondering what
7:25 this co does and um I read an article
7:28 before our chat I read an article about
7:30 this. So the article was about like the
7:32 role of co or something like this and um
7:35 so here is the summary. So in this
7:38 article it was saying that u there are
7:41 four main responsibilities of a chief
7:43 data officer. So the first one
7:45 governance which is monitoring and
7:47 governing enterprise data. I think you
7:49 mentioned governance as well. So then
7:52 operations uh it's enabling data
7:54 usability and availability. I think you
7:57 also said that uh like we need to u use
8:02 the data that's one of the things you
8:03 mentioned then the third thing was
8:06 innovation driving cost reduction and
8:08 generating revenue. And then the final
8:11 one was analysis supporting analytics
8:13 and reporting. So do you think it's the
8:15 accurate description of a role of a CD
8:18 role in general or something is missing?
8:21 It it covers part of it. I think that's
8:24 a more traditional uh maybe I would say
8:28 slightly outdated view on a chief data
8:31 officer role. Um I think as we move
8:33 forward the integration with innovation,
8:36 product development, business strategy
8:38 become more noticeable in chief data
8:41 officer roles because data is such a
8:43 crucial part of any business, right? It
8:45 it's what indicates how your business is
8:47 performing. So that ties to the
8:49 analytics, but it's also what powers a
8:51 lot of the product development and the
8:53 product working itself. Having the right
8:55 data to enable ML application to solve
8:58 different problems of course touches on
9:00 the access and usability of that data
9:02 touches on the collection and um
9:06 safety and and use of that data as well
9:09 but it also touches on understanding
9:11 what are the problems that you're trying
9:12 to solve and not just from an efficiency
9:14 perspective of how do we collect store
9:17 that data make it accessible in an
9:19 efficient way and innovate from that
9:21 perspective but also how do we
9:23 understand our user base, our customers
9:25 both external and internal so that we
9:28 can use this data to solve their
9:30 problems. And and I think that's the
9:32 direction that we're moving more towards
9:34 is having uh people in a position of
9:38 being able to drive the data
9:40 infrastructure and organizations, but
9:42 also understanding the real business
9:44 problems that can be solved through
9:46 data. often what I see is that there's a
9:49 bit of a disconnect between you know
9:51 business leaders want something to
9:53 happen and they have clear problems that
9:55 they need to solve but when they talk uh
9:57 and have interactions with of course not
10:00 always the case but in some situations
10:02 with the more technical side of the
10:03 organization there's a slight disconnect
10:06 because the technical side is usually
10:07 focused on here are some technical
10:10 problems that we need to solve uh versus
10:12 also thinking about how can we go beyond
10:15 that and use technology to solve some of
10:18 the problems that are of our users
10:20 externally and the business. And then
10:22 the the point that I'd um mentioned that
10:24 I think is part of the role is not
10:26 clearly articulated in that list uh at
10:29 least in in my view is this ability to
10:33 or responsibility to look forward and
10:35 think about how can we uh design for the
10:38 future and design for data and and what
10:41 I mean by that is in some regards uh
10:44 data is going to continue powering a lot
10:46 of the innovation that happens and the
10:48 more data you have and that includes
10:50 different types of data, the more you'll
10:52 be able to do with it and the more
10:54 you'll be able to think uh on what to do
10:56 with it. And that could be as simple as
10:58 sometimes, you know, um asking a user
11:01 question during the signup flow or
11:04 collecting some uh contextual
11:06 information such as location when some
11:08 level of interaction happens. And for
11:11 the most part, I think a lot of
11:12 companies are doing that by default, but
11:15 often think of data as a consequence of
11:18 the products that they have, not a
11:20 driver of the future products that they
11:23 can have. And and I I like to think that
11:25 is part of the responsibility of the
11:27 chief data officer is to think, you
11:29 know, three years from now, what data
11:31 will enable us to do something that we
11:33 don't do yet? And how can we get that
11:35 data in a uh ethical, responsible, and
11:39 safe way? Mhm. So basically you in your
11:42 role need to think about all these
11:44 things like I don't know how many things
11:46 we mentioned five or six
11:48 and uh how is it even possible for a
11:51 single person to keep track of of all
11:54 that uh like I imagine that you don't uh
11:57 you know just go there and analyze you
11:59 also don't go there and you know develop
12:01 an infrastructure you delegate a lot but
12:03 how do you keep track of all that how do
12:06 you know which things need to happen and
12:07 which don't Yeah, that's a good
12:10 question. Uh, well, one, they're all to
12:13 some extent related, right? The
12:15 production of data, the collection of
12:17 data, the access to that data,
12:18 utilization, uh, modeling that data so
12:21 it can be used in different context,
12:23 thinking about those contexts. But
12:25 ultimately, it comes down to working
12:27 with different people, right? No single
12:29 person can have the answers for all the
12:32 questions that um have to do with data
12:35 and and all the applications of that
12:36 data in whatever business context. So
12:39 building the right teams, having the
12:40 right teams, you know, having the right
12:42 people that know much better than me
12:44 what to do and I can offer the context,
12:47 the the the resources or the support for
12:50 them to to drive uh aspects of the
12:52 vision that is created jointly forward.
12:55 So I I think that is key to success in
12:58 in your organization where uh we have a
13:01 complex set of goals that interact with
13:03 each other is having the right people
13:05 that share that vision can communicate
13:06 that vision and work together to to
13:08 deliver it.
13:10 So basically uh for each of the sort of
13:13 pillars or responsibilities let's say we
13:15 have this operations part. So maybe you
13:18 would have a person who leads the like a
13:21 department maybe a director of
13:22 engineering right or director of data
13:24 engineering and then you would have
13:26 other people who would take care of each
13:28 of the pillars so to say and then your
13:33 role is to keep everything uh in mind at
13:36 the same time and try to make sure that
13:38 they are not disconnected right so
13:40 everyone uh like has the same context
13:43 and understand why we're doing certain
13:45 things like is it accurate somebody
13:47 yes I think so to some extent you know
13:50 the organizational design varies
13:52 depending on many things companies are
13:55 more and more distributed and there's
13:57 interaction between those teams that
13:58 sometimes might mean they should be
14:00 together sometimes separate there's
14:02 various types of organizations but
14:04 absolutely my role is more to enable
14:07 extract the information and the vision
14:09 from those different teams and try to
14:11 articulate in into a single vision or
14:14 single strategy that uh makesense for
14:17 both the business but also continuously
14:20 delivers value to our users which is the
14:22 biggest driver of the business.
14:24 Yeah, thanks. Oh, we already have a
14:26 question from Smeil and the question is
14:28 what skills are necessary to go from
14:30 head of data science or analytics to co
14:34 and I think uh this is something I also
14:36 wanted to ask how did you go from uh
14:40 like at some point you were probably
14:41 also ahead of something and then you
14:44 eventually become a co. So yeah, I'm
14:46 curious. So what uh the journey looked
14:49 like for you? What did you do to become
14:51 a CDO?
14:52 What what did I do? It's probably going
14:55 to take quite a while to to discuss and
14:57 and to be honest to map exactly the
15:00 things that led to this path. It's also
15:03 a a tough task. But in in general, I
15:05 think the key differences are not
15:08 necessarily in terms of skill set, is in
15:11 terms of uh where you spend your time.
15:13 and and I think more and more as you try
15:16 to to progress in a career and and take
15:19 a more I would say strategic role and
15:22 and that's I think um the the
15:24 consequence of moving in the direction
15:26 of a co is becoming or the the
15:28 requirement is becoming more and more
15:30 strategic and that means sometimes uh
15:33 prioritizing aggressively to focus on
15:35 the big picture the vision the distant
15:38 uh objectives that you have versus the
15:40 tactical operations and how to execute
15:42 that and And you know, I think this is
15:44 always key in any type of leadership
15:47 role is the ability to really empower
15:50 and enable people to do the best. Hiring
15:53 people that can do that much better than
15:55 you and being able to scale yourself and
15:57 not get too attached to the solutions
16:00 and the the execution of of that vision.
16:04 Uh in the end, you're going to rely and
16:06 depend entirely on the the people that
16:08 can do that with you. Uh uh so um I
16:12 think my journey has always revolved a
16:15 lot around being able to work very
16:18 closely with people and surrounding
16:20 myself with people that can do amazing
16:22 things and and working more as a
16:24 facilitator and enabler of their
16:26 fantastic work. And of course I I don't
16:29 want to you know um
16:32 mischaracterize the requirements of uh
16:35 this type of rule and I don't think that
16:37 is specific to CDO. could also be CTO,
16:40 CPO, etc. is having a good understanding
16:43 of the craft and and some background
16:46 that helps you, you know, guide people
16:48 that maybe sometimes are more technical
16:51 with you than you, sorry, and and bring
16:54 them along the journey with you and
16:56 having constructive conversations around
16:58 that, which I think are pretty hard to
17:00 do if you don't have any uh domain
17:02 knowledge, right? If you don't
17:03 understand the craft, if you don't
17:05 understand the the technology, it's hard
17:07 for you to to drive. Not impossible, but
17:09 hard for you to drive a group of complex
17:13 organizations and and being passionate
17:15 about what you do as well. And like you
17:17 said in the beginning, investing quite a
17:19 lot of time into it as well. I think
17:21 it's it's uh achievable by anyone just
17:25 as long as you focus on uh delivering
17:28 the best possible impact for your
17:30 business using the tools that you have
17:32 at your hand. In my case was um
17:34 understanding data and what to do with
17:36 data.
17:38 So well maybe to summarize I think you
17:41 said uh you need to become more
17:42 strategic and u always keep the big
17:45 picture in your mind have this vision
17:48 and uh you know maybe
17:51 uh get uh usually people say you know
17:54 you need to get more down to earth but
17:56 in your case it was you know you
17:57 actually need to to go a bit about to
18:00 see like the big picture right and uh
18:03 yeah I'm I'm always curious like when
18:05 people say you need to be more strategic
18:08 and then u also people like this
18:11 strategy tactics and tactics is
18:13 something that you do immediately right
18:15 and strategy is something that you know
18:17 long term is it the case right to some
18:20 extent I I see strategy as you know
18:22 what's your uh broad plan to get from
18:25 where you are to where you want to be
18:27 and more aligned with where you want to
18:30 be and the tactics or the execution are
18:32 the smaller steps that you take along
18:34 that journey and those change with uh
18:37 more frequency I would say than the
18:39 strategy and the long-term vision.
18:41 Okay. So basically the strategy could be
18:44 setting up some um um KPIs or some goals
18:49 like this is what we want to do in five
18:51 years right or in three years right and
18:53 then uh you kind of you tell about this
18:58 vision to others you try to convince
18:59 that this is the right direction to go
19:01 you try to explain and then it's up to
19:03 others to actually decide how do we go
19:05 there what needs to happen to actually
19:08 um to be there in three years right so
19:10 this is tactics like what are sequence
19:12 what is the sequence of steps we need to
19:14 do to achieve our goals goal in three
19:17 year right
19:18 yeah I think that's a good example it
19:20 would also include you know uh do we
19:22 have the right people to execute against
19:24 those tactics are am I enabling those
19:27 people giving them the right resources
19:29 setting them up for success uh so that's
19:32 part of my tactics to to push forward
19:35 the the strategy that I have in mind is
19:37 ensuring that we have the right people
19:39 also to build some of those strategy
19:42 blocks. You know, you can break down a
19:44 strategy into smaller pieces of that
19:46 strategy that then are executed using
19:49 some tactics. The line is blurry between
19:51 the two. Uh but it's exactly the case.
19:55 looking ahead, setting some ambitious
19:57 goals and then being able to decide what
20:00 are the components that you need to
20:01 break this down to make it happen and
20:03 working with the right people to you
20:05 know again share that workload across
20:08 and and finding hopefully people that
20:10 can actually execute some of those
20:12 better than you can individual.
20:15 Okay. Yeah. And also there is uh this
20:18 role called VP of data and u
20:22 I'm always wondering what is the
20:24 difference and in general um like we
20:27 have let's say we have CTO and we have
20:29 VP of engineering we have uh uh CPO who
20:32 is a chief product officer and then we
20:34 have VP of product and then we have co
20:36 and VP of data
20:39 and to me um uh this uh like co and VP
20:44 of data these roles look pretty similar.
20:46 are they are quite up uh in this
20:50 corporate hierarchy so to say right so
20:52 the both I guess are quite strategic so
20:55 they need to think about like what we
20:57 where we want to be in three years
21:00 so what is the difference between these
21:02 two roles
21:04 yeah the difference depends a little bit
21:06 on the organization right the the size
21:08 of the organization and ultimately boils
21:11 down to to the scope of the role I would
21:13 say that for a co uh you're hopefully a
21:17 level above in terms of the the strategy
21:19 influence, right? You're working very
21:21 closely with the CPO, working very
21:23 closely with the CTO, with the CEO, with
21:26 uh the CFO and making sure that uh again
21:29 you're thinking about all the angles of
21:32 how data is beneficial for your business
21:35 and used to drive that business as well
21:37 as your users. And then um a VP is
21:41 typically and again this differs a lot
21:43 depending on the size of the
21:44 organization. You'll have companies that
21:46 have a VP that is responsible for uh a
21:50 subset of their organization that is as
21:52 big or bigger than many other
21:54 organizations that have a CTO CDO. Um
21:57 but AP is typically responsible for a
21:59 piece of that, right? And that could be
22:01 attached to a business line, a domain or
22:03 a specific one of those pillars that I
22:06 mentioned could be more focused on uh
22:08 the government governance and collection
22:10 of data and infrastructure could be more
22:13 focused on uh the data science portion
22:15 or the analytics portion whereas CDL by
22:19 default has to have the uh horizontal
22:22 perspective and then uh of course the
22:24 business component because they're
22:26 they're part of the executive team.
22:28 Okay. I'm just uh trying to think maybe
22:31 of an example. Um I don't know a goal
22:33 could be let's say a certain company
22:35 wants to make x amount of money or has x
22:39 amount of market share or something like
22:41 this. So this would be like a strategic
22:44 goal, right? So this is where we want to
22:46 be in 3 years.
22:48 Yes.
22:48 And then you would think of okay, we
22:50 have this goal, how do we set our
22:52 strategy to actually to be there, right?
22:55 And then you maybe look at all these
22:57 pillars and try to you know understand
23:00 what needs to happen to be the like from
23:03 the data point of view what we need to
23:05 do to actually get that uh uh market
23:08 share right.
23:09 Yes.
23:09 And then
23:10 go ahead go ahead.
23:11 Yeah. And then I was thinking okay you
23:13 do that and then the P of data would
23:16 maybe you kind of decompose the strategy
23:17 into multiple things and VP of data
23:19 would take one of the pieces. Uh
23:22 yes to to some extent I would say that
23:25 uh on the the co level at least from my
23:28 perspective the expectation is also not
23:31 just to say here's what we need to do
23:32 from a data uh angle to be able to
23:35 achieve that goal. It is also here's
23:38 some goals that we can set that will
23:40 drive the business in this way. Right?
23:42 Not just thinking of as a supporting
23:45 function to drive the business but as a
23:47 driver of the business itself. Right? if
23:50 we do these five things from a data
23:52 angle, the business will grow by this
23:54 much. So I think there's that proactive
23:56 component as well. um that is uh likely
24:00 to be more present in the
24:02 responsibilities of a co not in the
24:05 person but the responsibilities of the
24:07 role whereas a and again depends a lot
24:10 on the the scope um of of the role but
24:13 um whereas a VP is typically attached to
24:15 a specific component of that strategy
24:19 like you mentioned u but like I
24:21 mentioned depends greatly if it's a an
24:24 organization that is 200 people with a
24:26 very clear um domain or a very clear
24:30 problem to solve, then maybe the role of
24:32 a co in that context is actually smaller
24:35 than the role of a VP in a uh bigger
24:39 context where they own a specific angle
24:41 of the strategy that is in of itself
24:43 much larger, right? Uh so it depends a
24:46 little bit, but I'd say the
24:47 distinguishing factor is typically
24:49 looking across multiple points.
24:52 Is it uh
24:55 do u like for a CTO um do they usually
24:58 have multiple VPs reporting to them or
25:01 just one VP of data?
25:03 I think it depends greatly on the
25:05 organization. Yeah, I I think in many
25:08 cases they can have several depending on
25:10 how they structure the the organizations
25:13 that you know, let's use a a practical
25:16 example that um is is not necessarily
25:18 attached to any of the companies that
25:20 I've worked at, but you could have a
25:22 company that is split into producers and
25:25 consumers of some sort of content,
25:28 right? And then you can have someone
25:29 who's responsible for a data strategy
25:31 for producers and someone else who's the
25:34 VP of data for the uh consumers whereas
25:38 the the co has to work with both those
25:40 people and then there might be other
25:41 components that as well. Um but again it
25:45 depends on on the organization that you
25:47 have. Uh it is not very common to have
25:50 just one person in the reporting line.
25:52 Um and then it also depends on the
25:54 career ladder of the organization. Some
25:56 organizations have a long and steep
25:59 career ladder where you have senior
26:00 manager, director, senior director, VP,
26:03 senior VP. Some have a more flat
26:06 hierarchy where they'll have, you know,
26:08 manager and then director and then VP.
26:10 So, there's there's a little bit of of
26:12 that going in there as well.
26:15 Yeah. Uh, a few companies back, I worked
26:17 at a company where we had a CTO and then
26:20 the CTO had a VP of engineering
26:23 reporting to him. And that situation
26:26 seemed pretty strange to me. It looked
26:28 like a VP is doing all the work and the
26:32 CTO actually just manages one person. So
26:35 I was always curious how actually like
26:37 how do they split responsibilities
26:40 between each other because like if you
26:42 look just from like at the hierarchy
26:45 like this organizational structure this
26:47 actually like okay know like you have co
26:50 then maybe VP of data and then VP of
26:52 data um has a bunch of people reporting
26:55 to him.
26:56 Yeah, right or to her. I think again it
26:59 depends a lot on the organization right
27:01 if you have to spend a lot of time
27:02 thinking about you know what uh kinds of
27:05 data will we need in the future how do
27:07 we tie and we enable the business to
27:10 move in this direction how do we uh
27:12 report data in a way or how do you
27:14 comply with the governance models from a
27:17 specific region of the world etc um and
27:20 then you need to also at the same time
27:23 execute against building this tool
27:25 building this framework building this
27:27 infrastruure structure then the division
27:29 of of work can be fairly simple and
27:31 there's still a ton of of work to do um
27:34 that is covered by a co versus a VP but
27:37 like I mentioned I think that's entirely
27:38 dependent on the size of the
27:40 organization how the roles are defined
27:43 and this applies not just to to data
27:45 right it applies to CPO to VP of product
27:48 uh for technology as well as as well as
27:51 other functions so it just depends on
27:54 how much is there to do and how many
27:56 people do we need to do it successfully
27:58 and continue building upon that.
28:01 Do you know what's the the main
28:03 difference between CTO, CPU and CDO? Uh
28:07 like to me uh like when I look uh um
28:10 like in the like top management
28:14 it's all about meetings and setting
28:16 strategy and uh you know planning for
28:18 budgets.
28:19 This uh responsibilities look pretty
28:22 similar. So what's the core difference
28:25 between all these uh people all these
28:28 roles?
28:28 That's a good question. Um and in
28:31 practice it depends again a lot on the
28:33 type of company you have the type of
28:35 product uh in some cases the product is
28:38 more technology related if you're
28:40 building you know a a framework or a
28:42 platform that other companies are going
28:44 to use uh versus building something that
28:47 end users etc. So it varies quite a bit
28:50 but I I would say the typically the
28:52 responsibilities are are different in
28:54 the sense that a CPO is more focused on
28:57 determining what is the product vision
28:59 right what is the product supposed to do
29:02 and then works with the CTO which is
29:04 focused on how do we build that and how
29:06 the product uh or how we use technology
29:09 to make that vision come to life and
29:11 then um the co is more concerned with
29:14 okay what data do we have that enables
29:16 us to build that to inform form the
29:18 direction that we're going in and to
29:21 continue pushing that that vision
29:22 forward. So that could be a high level
29:25 theoretical division of of
29:27 responsibilities.
29:28 But like I mentioned, I think it depends
29:30 a lot. I I've seen the case where you
29:32 know some companies their product is
29:34 data and there the CEO can likely uh
29:37 fulfill both roles. I've seen places
29:39 where all of those roles are combined.
29:42 uh and I've seen places where they're
29:43 very clear um differentiated because
29:46 that's the nature of the product and the
29:48 technology stack that they have as well
29:50 as the data they produce for consumers.
29:52 Mhm. So maybe to make it a bit concrete,
29:56 we talked about this example of I don't
29:58 know get X market share or like have
30:02 that amount of revenue. Probably this is
30:04 a goal that maybe a CEO would set
30:08 together with the entire team, right?
30:10 And then it would be up to the CTO, CPO,
30:14 CDO to actually decide how to decompose
30:17 this goal and what uh kind of data
30:20 initiatives uh could happen right so
30:23 like I don't know um we need to make
30:26 data available to make this this and
30:28 this available or possible right and so
30:31 basically everyone thinks in terms of uh
30:33 okay what we can do from the engineering
30:35 point of view like what we can do from
30:37 the product point of view what we can do
30:39 from the data point of view, right? And
30:41 then it kind of cascades down to uh
30:44 maybe later to PP of data, right? Who
30:47 would need to think about a particular
30:49 chunk of the um um I don't know the
30:54 strategy, right? And then up to uh I
30:57 don't know engineering managers and so
30:59 on, right?
31:00 Yeah. VP of data, whatever the titles
31:02 are in that organization, whatever the
31:05 design of the organization is. Uh again
31:07 I would add that the responsibilities of
31:09 those three seale type of roles are
31:12 beyond just you know executing or
31:15 breaking down the strategy of what a CEO
31:18 asks for into the specific functions
31:20 that they represent but also to provide
31:23 input and actually offer a vision of the
31:26 future that that CEO can then put
31:28 together and and help ensure that he
31:31 enables the the the other sea level
31:33 executives to deliver against. Yeah, I
31:35 like to think of it as a more of a
31:37 proactive role where you're uh not just
31:40 delivering against something that is
31:42 asked of you. You're offering
31:44 opportunities to a person that can help
31:45 you make those decisions or make those
31:47 decisions for you to move forward.
31:49 So yeah, I think you mentioned at some
31:51 point like if we do uh these uh I don't
31:55 know five things then we would achieve
31:57 um this goal, right? And I'm wondering
32:00 like how do you come up with these
32:02 things? So how do you know let's say if
32:04 we need to invest into a data platform
32:06 or how do you know if we need to enable
32:09 our analysts to process data better or
32:12 how do you need how do you know if we
32:14 need like I don't know a better machine
32:16 learning platform like all these things
32:18 like how do you know where the company
32:22 should go to achieve this goal I don't
32:24 know in three years
32:26 yeah u that's a broad question I think
32:29 there there's many ways of approaching
32:30 that but uh typically Ally how I I like
32:33 to approach that is to if we've aligned
32:36 on the goals working back from those
32:38 goals and trying to understand what are
32:40 the blockers for us to achieve that and
32:42 then trying to break those blockers down
32:45 by what is the size or or the magnitude
32:47 and impact of that blocker and
32:49 optimizing for the things that are going
32:51 to help us get there faster. Right? the
32:53 enablers typically of what is going to
32:55 help you drive that vision forward and
32:57 the vision itself is also organized
32:59 around the impact that it brings to
33:02 again value for users, value for the
33:04 business. What are the biggest bets that
33:06 you can take that are going to help your
33:08 company, your colleagues and ultimately
33:10 your users to to have a better
33:12 experience to get more value out of the
33:14 product or set of products and be able
33:16 to achieve their goals faster. Um so so
33:19 that's how I I set goals is
33:22 understanding what are the big problems
33:25 around us from a user perspective from a
33:27 business perspective from an
33:28 organization or technological p
33:30 perspective and then see which ones that
33:33 we can solve will drive the most impact
33:36 and get us closer to the shared vision
33:38 not just the data vision but the shared
33:40 vision for the company and then uh try
33:43 to work back from those and understand
33:45 okay for us to get here we now have
33:47 multip multiple platforms that slow us
33:50 down if we have a common one. Uh we
33:52 agree that we all can move faster. So
33:54 let's build that together. Um so that's
33:56 typically how you break down goals and
33:58 and work backwards from them and try to
34:00 come up with simpler things and simpler
34:02 chunks that then you can provide uh full
34:05 ownership accountability to to people
34:08 that can drive that further than you
34:10 can.
34:11 So basically for you, you care more
34:13 about blockers and problems than
34:16 solutions, right? And then uh your team
34:18 or uh like uh people who who you work
34:22 with then they think about okay for this
34:26 blocker this could be a solution because
34:28 we are doing this uh thing in not a
34:30 super optimal way and to make it more
34:32 optimal we need to do this and uh you
34:35 just uh I guess trust these people to do
34:37 their job you don't uh interfere and
34:40 then you just check that we indeed move
34:41 in the direction we want. Right.
34:43 Exactly. I think an essential component
34:45 of that is aligning on how are we going
34:47 to assess whether we're moving in the
34:49 right direction and what what are the
34:51 metrics that help us understand whether
34:52 we're achieving our goal and then of
34:54 course you have to have some level of
34:57 one trust on the people that are going
34:58 to do that but also understanding and
35:00 visibility into how it's progressing so
35:02 that you can unblock can enable people
35:04 but also correct uh if necessary right
35:08 uh you experiment with something and
35:09 you're moving in the right direction or
35:11 not you you have to make some of those
35:13 adjustments
35:14 And then also to bring the right
35:16 context. If all these pieces have some
35:18 level of interaction and people don't
35:20 have visibility across, it is also my
35:22 responsibility to create that visibility
35:24 and to to find synergies where they
35:26 could exist.
35:28 So would you say that uh one of your
35:30 responsibilities is uh somehow measuring
35:33 the effectiveness of different teams,
35:36 projects, initiatives. Maybe not
35:37 measuring but uh making sure that it's
35:40 measurable. can be measured right like
35:42 everything we do um like let's say there
35:44 is a new initiative um then um people
35:48 agree that well okay we want to uh like
35:51 define a KPI first some sort of KPI and
35:54 then both agree that uh like everyone
35:56 agrees that uh this how the KPI should
35:59 move and uh your job is to make sure
36:03 that this is measurable and everyone
36:05 agrees on the KPI everyone is aligned
36:07 right
36:08 yeah I I think that's the responsibility
36:10 of any leader or manager to to be able
36:12 to set clear goals and then have uh
36:15 clear ways of creating ownership
36:18 accountability and then measuring
36:19 whether you're moving in the right
36:20 direction that becomes I think uh to be
36:23 fully transparent even more relevant for
36:26 a data focused leader because we live
36:29 and die by data so we care a lot about
36:32 what types of data are we looking at how
36:34 we're collecting that data to ensure
36:35 that we have a good view on whether
36:38 we're progressing in the right direction
36:39 or not generating more data through
36:41 experimentation through different trials
36:44 and and errors and and figuring out uh
36:46 how we move in the right direction.
36:48 Yeah. Mhm. I'm curious uh like how many
36:52 meetings per day do you have like to to
36:55 be able to do all that to align with all
36:57 the people your day must be full like
37:00 it's full with meetings right
37:03 it is pretty full I fortunately benefit
37:06 of having someone who helps me manage my
37:08 calendar and also having an amazing team
37:11 or a set of teams that I I work directly
37:14 with either under me or across our group
37:17 that I collaborate with which helped me
37:20 minimize the meetings. But nonetheless,
37:22 I still have around 8 to 10 meetings a
37:24 day on a regular cadence. I'm trying to
37:27 reduce that so I have a little bit more
37:29 time to like we were discussing think
37:31 long term and articulate some of those
37:34 visions and strategies for the rest of
37:36 the organization for discussion. But uh
37:39 right now it's still a pretty uh
37:41 jam-packed uh schedule. Yeah.
37:44 Yeah. So how do you not go crazy with
37:47 this amount of meetings or this is a
37:49 trait that a co must have?
37:53 Um I I I have a few things that work
37:56 well for me. One is I like some of the
37:59 meetings that I have. Some become
38:01 tedious but in general I like the the
38:02 meetings that I have because I typically
38:05 always learn something from them and I
38:07 also like the people that I work with.
38:09 So I'm very lucky to be part of a broad
38:12 team that has fantastic people that I
38:14 enjoy even through Zoom spending time
38:17 with. So that's one of the the benefits
38:19 that I think I I'm lucky enough to have.
38:21 But then you know I also try to plan
38:24 ahead and again I benefit from someone
38:27 who helps me manage my schedule and and
38:30 uh organizes it in a way that makes
38:32 sense and I can prepare for. So that
38:35 helps quite a bit so I don't have to
38:36 switch too much context. Simple example
38:39 is having one-on- ones with my reports
38:41 in one day more strategic uh discussions
38:44 with uh external people in another day
38:46 with internal people in another day that
38:48 sort of of thing team meetings different
38:51 day so having a little bit of that
38:53 structure helps quite a bit and then
38:55 everything else that I do outside of
38:57 work as well uh of course there's some
38:59 more techniques like documenting taking
39:02 notes making sure that there's action
39:04 that takes place after the meeting so
39:06 that the meeting isn't and fruitful and
39:08 you know we we move forward and I don't
39:10 have to revisit the same issue over and
39:12 over again in subsequent meetings but um
39:15 also everything that I do outside of
39:17 work you know uh sports that help me you
39:20 know um separate a little bit from the
39:22 zoom world that we live in right now and
39:25 you know uh clear up my mind focus on
39:27 different things taking some different
39:29 uh projects within work as well that
39:31 have to do with uh potentially things
39:33 like inclusion diversity that I'm
39:36 passionate about and are not so related
39:38 to the things that I do on a daily
39:40 basis. It helps me sometimes switch
39:43 context and and you know have my brain
39:45 thinking about different problems as
39:46 well. That helps otherwise you get too
39:49 um closed up in one specific problem and
39:52 uh it it limits your ability to to think
39:54 through it sometimes.
39:56 Yeah. Thanks.
39:57 Of course.
39:58 Yeah. Do you do you have any like tools
40:01 uh for that like productivity tools? you
40:03 man you you mentioned that uh you get
40:05 help somebody manages your calendar to
40:07 make sure that these things uh happen.
40:09 Do do you use any tools on top of that
40:12 to that help you be more effective?
40:15 Um well there are some traditional
40:18 communication tools that I use to you
40:20 know be in touch and have more sorry
40:23 both
40:26 chat tools and and um you know some
40:28 platforms to communicate with my team
40:30 and to again documentation is I think a
40:33 pretty powerful way of sharing some
40:36 vision collecting feedback without
40:38 necessarily having to spend time in in a
40:40 meeting and doing so offline asynchrony
40:43 um or synchrony. and and then you know
40:46 uh typically just being available and
40:48 having quick conversations that
40:50 sometimes can solve a problem and avoid
40:53 uh a meeting just by
40:56 chatting with someone for a couple of
40:58 minutes. Uh so those are tools that I
41:00 use that help my my productivity. But
41:02 then I think basically it's just keeping
41:04 a structured schedule. Uh being able to
41:07 take short breaks as well helps quite a
41:09 bit.
41:10 Interesting. I never never thought of
41:13 charts like Slack as a tool, but it is
41:16 and often it can save you time, right?
41:19 You see, okay, maybe this meeting should
41:21 be just a charge in Slack.
41:23 Absolutely. Yeah. Okay. quite often
41:26 multiple times a day I'd say
41:28 but uh these meetings still happen or
41:31 well if you can solve the problem
41:33 through Slack which often is the case
41:35 yeah you don't have to have the meeting
41:37 but uh in some situations the the Slack
41:40 or conversation or whatever tool you're
41:42 using conversation will expedite the
41:44 meeting because you come in with some
41:46 context already
41:47 discussed read some documentation which
41:49 is something that I think we're adopting
41:51 quite a bit now is reading whatever
41:53 context you have before the meeting
41:55 starts or right at the beginning of the
41:56 meeting which then expedites the
41:58 conversation and discussion quite a bit.
42:01 Okay. Yeah. Thanks. We have quite a few
42:03 questions from the audience. So maybe
42:05 we'll uh start going through them. Okay.
42:08 First the first question we have is uh
42:11 is the co responsible to beat to build a
42:14 datadriven culture or is it a management
42:18 role and how a co can achieve that? I
42:21 think absolutely I I'd go past that and
42:24 say it's everyone's responsibility to
42:26 build a data driven
42:28 you should promote it you should explain
42:30 that this is important right
42:31 absolutely
42:32 otherwise maybe product people don't
42:33 know or maybe I don't know if they're
42:36 supposed to know or
42:37 anyone in your organization right anyone
42:39 has to make decisions and you can always
42:41 make better decisions if you have some
42:43 level of information and data or
42:45 evidence that enables you to make a
42:47 smart decision I think it is especially
42:49 the co's role to enable a company or a
42:52 culture to be data driven. Right? I
42:54 think there's a part of people
42:56 understanding that data plays a role and
42:59 being eager to have that data that helps
43:01 them make great decisions and then it's
43:03 the co or the data team's role to make
43:06 sure that when people need data they
43:09 have that available and that they can
43:10 also think ahead and provide data that
43:13 maybe people even thought uh that would
43:15 be useful yet but will be useful at some
43:17 point to them and and making sure that
43:19 people are aware and have access to
43:21 that. That comes back to the data
43:23 usability and so on. It is not just for
43:25 algorithms and and products to use. It's
43:28 for people to use to make decisions.
43:30 Ties very closely to analytics and so on
43:32 which is another uh component of the the
43:35 role that you mentioned. And I think it
43:36 is the co's role to ensure that that is
43:39 set in place so that data is well
43:41 democratized, accessible, easy to use,
43:45 quick to use in a way that uh you can
43:47 make fast decisions. And sometimes that
43:49 means not just looking at data but
43:51 producing and uh leveraging that data to
43:54 generate insights.
43:56 Okay. So it's everyone's uh
43:58 responsibility but uh uh co should make
44:01 sure that um you know there are tools uh
44:04 for doing that. I think everyone can use
44:07 the tools
44:09 and people are educated as well. Mhm. Um
44:12 do you feel that remote work uh is
44:15 challenging u your role um especially
44:18 when you manage your team?
44:20 Absolutely. Yes. Um so full transparency
44:23 I I haven't met the people in my team.
44:26 I've never been to an office because I I
44:28 joined uh Ox after the the pandemic and
44:32 and this trend of remote work started.
44:35 it has not been um I'd say limiting or
44:39 it hasn't prevented me from doing the
44:41 things that I want to do. But of course
44:42 it is a challenge. it's it's hard to
44:45 build relationships to get to know
44:47 people on a more personal level which uh
44:49 in many cases helps uh some discussions
44:52 to take place understanding people's
44:54 motivations what uh makes them tick is
44:57 is I think a really important component
44:59 of working with others and doing that
45:01 through a little window in your computer
45:04 um is much harder than doing that in
45:07 facetoface situations at the office
45:09 where you uh spontaneously meet someone
45:12 and a conversation comes comes up and
45:13 you have ideas, exchange ideas. It is uh
45:17 challenging absolutely it hasn't
45:19 prevented me from achieving the things
45:21 that I want to but likely has caused you
45:24 know uh more work that uh and and more
45:27 investment into some of those
45:29 relationships that uh I'd have to do in
45:32 a nonverirtual world that that we live
45:34 in right now.
45:35 So you need to to communicate more now
45:38 in remote world.
45:39 Yes. Yes. and provide more context that
45:42 often you know people can get uh from
45:45 the real life context and situational
45:47 context versus now you have to provide a
45:50 little bit of extra uh when you have uh
45:53 you know virtual conversations and I
45:55 think there's quite a lot of research on
45:57 the added cognitive load that having
46:00 virtual meetings and reading contextual
46:02 cues from people's gestures and language
46:04 and so on uh that is attached to us
46:07 living in this world now where
46:08 everything is online. Yeah.
46:11 Yeah. But surprisingly it uh well from
46:15 what I saw this remote work thing uh is
46:18 not that bad. Like it kind of works. I
46:21 think of course it's bad not to be able
46:23 to see people meet in office but uh I
46:27 thought it would be worse actually.
46:29 Yeah. No, absolutely. I think it brings
46:31 quite a bit of advantages as well. It's
46:34 not just problems or challenges and
46:36 opportunities. I think the fact that uh
46:38 you can now have access to talent that
46:41 would never want to relocate to where
46:43 you have an office and you can still
46:45 employ them and benefit from their
46:46 amazing skills, creativity, ideas, and
46:49 perspectives is amazing. So, it opens
46:52 doors for a lot of things and for people
46:54 to live where they want to live and
46:56 still work for the companies that they
46:58 want to work that have the missions that
46:59 they're passionate about, I think it's
47:01 it's a fantastic thing. I am just very
47:04 sensitive to the fact that it's not the
47:06 same for everyone. Some people love it
47:08 and will thrive in that environment.
47:09 Some people and I know quite a few few
47:12 people like this that still crave the
47:14 the human connection that they get out
47:16 of the office. Also the fact that it
47:18 gets them out of the house and you know
47:20 spending time with others and then you
47:22 get a chance to go for lunch uh during
47:24 your your lunch break. Um, so it it it
47:28 of course brings a lot of options and I
47:30 think it is something that has a lot of
47:32 benefits uh that we're still starting to
47:35 observe, but I think it's um hard to to
47:38 debate that it also brings some
47:39 challenges especially for for certain
47:41 people.
47:42 Yeah. Interesting. By the way, I'm right
47:44 now in the office, so maybe you can see
47:46 not not here.
47:50 Yeah. So yeah, I do like this uh routine
47:53 of commuting while I'm biking to work uh
47:56 and then having lunch and accidentally
47:58 bumping into colleagues and then have
48:00 these little chats. So that's cool. Um
48:03 so um do you think the CDRO role
48:05 requires deep technical skills and what
48:08 kind of technical expertise is needed
48:10 for the role like machine learning,
48:11 programming, SQL, something else?
48:15 Uh I would say that you can always
48:17 benefit from having deep technical
48:19 skills but uh like we discussed before
48:21 that I think the role um relies more on
48:25 being able to look across find you know
48:29 touch points between different parts of
48:32 a strategy different organizations
48:34 different pillars of what data means in
48:36 our current context and the definition
48:38 of data or data science continues to
48:40 broaden up from uh applied ML to you
48:44 data engineering to analytics and
48:47 insights all those things are continuing
48:49 to grow as we collect more data and
48:51 learn new ways of of using it. Um so I
48:55 think it benefits uh us more at least it
48:58 has benefited me more to have a good
49:02 level of understanding of the technical
49:05 portions of it and a good technical
49:07 background but not necessarily being too
49:11 deep into one specific area. Uh, of
49:13 course that can be an advantage in
49:15 certain contexts, but what has been more
49:18 useful to me or what has proved more
49:20 useful to me is being able to dip my toe
49:23 and understand and being able to
49:25 converse and articulate my perspective
49:28 in different areas uh than being able to
49:31 dive very very deep into one specific
49:33 area.
49:35 So you need to know a bit of everything
49:36 but maybe not too deep.
49:38 Yeah. And that doesn't mean that I don't
49:40 have one specific thing that I've been
49:42 able or in the past I went deep into.
49:45 But as you progress in this um type of
49:48 role, it is beneficial to then of course
49:52 get a better understanding of other
49:54 components and that comes as with a
49:56 consequence of not being able to spend
49:59 as much time on that thing that you're
50:01 an expert to begin with. And given the
50:04 the field that we work in and how fast
50:06 it moves, then you end up, you know, uh
50:09 not being that much of an expert anymore
50:11 because technology advances, tools
50:14 advance, and then uh it's it's hard to
50:16 keep up if you have to keep tabs and
50:18 juggle many balls.
50:20 Yeah. What do you think about MBA? Do
50:23 you do COS need an MBA to be successful?
50:28 I I wouldn't say they need one because I
50:30 I don't have one and I'm in this role.
50:33 Um
50:35 while the successful part is is
50:37 something that we'll see over time, but
50:39 I think it's likely beneficial. Any type
50:42 of education that gives you a different
50:44 perspective, especially one that ties
50:46 very closely to understanding a business
50:48 and managing a business is likely to be
50:50 very beneficial. Right? That was one of
50:52 the points that we made at the beginning
50:53 of the conversation is that I think in a
50:56 a any executive or seale role, you have
50:59 to understand the business. You cannot
51:00 just understand your function and your
51:02 craft. You have to be able to understand
51:05 how that can be used to drive the
51:07 business. And uh I I it's my assumption
51:09 that an MBA prepares you well for that.
51:12 I don't have one. I've never gone
51:13 through the process of getting one. So I
51:16 don't know what the extent of that will
51:18 be. and I've met, you know, many CEOs,
51:21 CTO's, CDOS's that don't have MBAs, uh,
51:24 and are very successful. So, I don't
51:26 think it is a requirement, but it's
51:28 likely helpful. Of course,
51:31 it's like maybe looking at Mark
51:33 Zuckerberg and deciding that I don't
51:35 need university education, right?
51:38 I think he's he's one of many examples.
51:40 Yeah, I think you know, any anyone like
51:43 it's useful at the end.
51:44 Exactly. It can be very useful. can
51:46 prepare well for certain problems. But
51:49 you know, in the case of of Zach or any
51:51 of those very successful CEOs, they're
51:53 just very smart people that are able to
51:55 accumulate a lot of knowledge from the
51:57 experiences that they go through, the
51:59 challenges that they overcome. The
52:00 failures that they have, I think that's
52:03 something that often we don't talk
52:04 about. Those very successful people went
52:06 through a lot of failures as well, and
52:08 they're able to learn from it. And you
52:10 know that experience sometimes
52:11 especially if you're man managing a big
52:13 business is equivalent if not better
52:15 than than an academic version of it.
52:18 Yeah, maybe this is one of the main u
52:22 you know skills being able to learn from
52:25 you know from all this experience to
52:27 become a co because the next question is
52:29 what are the main keys to be a
52:32 successful co and how to build these
52:34 skills. So I think we also talked about
52:36 this a bit like at the beginning like
52:39 you said like you need to be more
52:41 strategic. You need to have uh this big
52:43 picture vision and you also need to
52:46 always keep a business side in mind.
52:49 not just focus on data but also think
52:51 how does uh you know like how is it
52:56 helpful for the company right in general
52:57 how do work together with other um sort
52:59 of functions like CPOS's CTO right is
53:03 there something else that like uh
53:05 something very important uh to be a co
53:10 uh I think in terms of skills uh softer
53:13 skills especially you know being able to
53:16 communicate and articulate a vision and
53:18 a strategy and being able to uh to some
53:22 extent inspire uh the the people that
53:25 will then help you drive that vision
53:27 forward I think is is pretty important.
53:30 uh being somewhat uh empathetic also to
53:34 the people that you work with, but also
53:36 the people that you want to serve
53:37 through what you do is is especially
53:39 important, especially in nowadays where,
53:42 you know, there's so much competition in
53:43 whatever area that you work in. And um
53:46 if if you're doing things right, you're
53:48 starting with your customer, thinking
53:50 about your users, and uh understanding
53:52 that your position, your needs are not
53:55 necessarily the same as theirs, and
53:57 being able to put yourself in their
53:58 shoes. and then uh drive solutions that
54:01 uh are applied to their problems as well
54:03 I think is is a skill that is not
54:06 important just for a co it's important
54:07 for anyone who's trying to drive a
54:10 business to success um and those are
54:13 softer skills but I think just as
54:15 important as some of the hard skills as
54:17 well
54:18 there is a question from somebody called
54:20 Yanis Z
54:22 maybe
54:24 sounds like somebody we both know
54:27 uh so the question is what was the
54:30 biggest challenge challenge within the
54:32 group so far given that it's pretty it's
54:35 pretty diverse group both geographically
54:37 and in terms of text tax and maturity.
54:39 Yeah, I I think that is the the biggest
54:42 challenge so far I'd say is that um we
54:45 have a a group that is fairly big has a
54:48 set of different companies within it.
54:50 Each of those companies operate in
54:52 different regions and geographies with
54:54 different domains and business lines all
54:56 the way uh you know from jobs and
54:59 services to car transactions to uh
55:03 classified to u transaction models and
55:06 goods as well. So there's a wide variety
55:08 of business lines of uh problems user
55:12 bases to deal with and uh that generates
55:16 a lot of complexity and this is even
55:18 excluding the organizational complexity
55:20 of us existing in multiple markets not
55:23 being able to travel and meet each other
55:25 in person. I'd say that has likely been
55:28 the the biggest challenge is just how
55:30 complex it is. Uh it's also the probably
55:33 the most fun part in addition to working
55:35 with amazing people is being able to
55:38 immerse myself in so many different
55:40 topics. And you never get bored. There's
55:42 so much stuff happening all the way from
55:45 online to offline as well. And in some
55:47 cases, some of our companies have
55:49 inspection centers and dealerships and
55:52 things like that. And those generate
55:53 data as well. not likely collected in
55:56 the same way but relevant and that we
55:58 can use in a a smart way nonetheless. So
56:01 I think that's been the biggest
56:03 challenge but also one of the most fun
56:04 things is there's so much opportunity
56:06 for data data science analytics all of
56:09 those things to to play an important
56:11 role and solve some big problems for our
56:13 users and for the business that um it's
56:16 it's an awesome thing to be a part of
56:19 but it is challenging there's a lot to
56:21 wrap your mind around. Yeah, it's
56:23 probably like at the end of each day,
56:25 your head must be spinning with the
56:27 amount of information you you had to
56:29 process throughout the day.
56:31 Yeah, I won't deny that. That's that's
56:34 very true.
56:35 Uh so we have a question from Carina. Um
56:39 so let's say somebody wants to interview
56:41 for a co position. Somebody wants to get
56:44 to get hired as a co. So how do you how
56:47 can you demonstrate the skills we talked
56:49 about like looking across the
56:51 organization create synergies and so on
56:53 on that interview?
56:56 Oh that's a a a super tricky question
56:59 because I think it depends on quite a
57:00 bit of quite a lot of things. One
57:02 depends on what are the skills that are
57:04 preferred or necessary for that specific
57:07 co role right like we talked in the
57:09 beginning uh co roles can have different
57:11 flavors in different organizations. So
57:14 depends on that. Then the second one um
57:17 you know I think it depends a lot on the
57:19 process. Some processes will have a
57:22 presentation where you have a case study
57:23 and you need to demonstrate the
57:25 communication skills by sharing what you
57:28 thought your strategic skill by you know
57:31 looking at the problem that they gave
57:33 you and thinking is this the real
57:35 problem? Are there different problems
57:37 associated to this one? Is this the
57:39 right problem for us to be looking at?
57:41 and then thinking how you can leverage
57:43 different components of the resources,
57:45 the teams and so on that you have to
57:47 push that forward. In some cases, that
57:49 will happen on one-on-one conversations.
57:52 But in general, I I think it's just
57:55 demonstrating that you care deeply about
57:57 the problems that are being presented to
57:59 you that um you'd go and try to gather
58:02 as much context and information as
58:05 possible and think about what other data
58:08 points would be necessary to provide a
58:10 solid answer to that. And being honest
58:12 when you don't have an immediate answer
58:14 and you need more data because that's
58:15 part of our role is identifying when we
58:17 need more data. And then uh making sure
58:20 that you're able to communicate that
58:22 clearly and you'd be able to leverage
58:24 the knowledge of others and scale
58:27 yourself up through the teams that
58:29 you're able to build and and hire in
58:32 order to drive those visions uh to to
58:34 fruition. Uh but it's kind of hard to
58:37 answer that that question specifically
58:39 because different people have different
58:40 ways of demonstrating those skills,
58:42 right? But uh in most cases, just answer
58:45 the the questions that are asked of you
58:47 and show if those questions aren't being
58:49 asked directly, show that you can go
58:51 beyond what's just being asked.
58:53 Yeah. Thanks. And some of these things I
58:55 think are pretty useful for any
58:57 interview. Basically doing this homework
59:00 and trying to uh showing that you care
59:03 about the problem and then doing a bit
59:05 of uh uh like understanding what the
59:07 company is actually doing, what kind of
59:09 problems they might have. That is
59:11 probably useful for anyone from junior
59:13 to junior data scientist to the co,
59:16 right?
59:16 Absolutely. And and being honest and
59:18 truthful about what you know and you
59:20 don't know and not being afraid to ask
59:22 questions yourself and also, you know,
59:24 fail and and say the wrong things in
59:27 some situation because no one has the
59:29 answer for everything.
59:31 Do you have time for one more question?
59:33 Let's go for it. Yes.
59:35 So, this is a pretty interesting
59:37 question. That's why I wanted to ask you
59:38 from Ricky. So Ricky says that um he
59:42 agrees 100% with the empathies on
59:44 strategic vision and understanding the
59:46 needs of business. Uh but how to
59:48 overcome resistance to the details of
59:51 your vision when somebody maybe
59:52 disagrees with uh that.
59:55 Well, I'd say the first thing is
59:56 understand why they disagree because in
59:58 some cases they might have a a better
1:00:01 idea and and you should be open to
1:00:03 taking that feedback and adjusting your
1:00:05 idea. Uh and then I I I think um often
1:00:09 you know convincing someone that your
1:00:11 idea is good or makes sense uh goes to
1:00:15 breaking down the problem and providing
1:00:17 the evidence that suggests sometimes
1:00:19 it's not the evidence that it might be
1:00:22 or that it is a better idea. It might be
1:00:24 a hypothesis hypothesis right in visions
1:00:27 that that's typically the case. You have
1:00:28 a hypothesis that this will be a good
1:00:32 solution for a problem that you're
1:00:33 trying to solve. uh and then having a
1:00:36 concrete plan on how you're going to
1:00:37 prove or disprove that hypothesis and
1:00:40 what is the data and information or
1:00:42 evidence or context or um input that
1:00:45 leads you to believe that that's a
1:00:47 strong hypothesis that you can validate
1:00:49 that you can measure and that you can u
1:00:52 at some point uh prove or disprove. So,
1:00:55 so I'd say that, you know, probably the
1:00:59 best way to approach it is uh breaking
1:01:01 down the problem and then demonstrating
1:01:03 why and articulating in a clear way why
1:01:06 that is your idea, but always being open
1:01:08 to to being disproven yourself and to uh
1:01:11 getting feedback. Like I mentioned
1:01:13 several times, I like to surround myself
1:01:16 with people that know about certain
1:01:18 problems much more than I do, and
1:01:19 they're likely to come up with better
1:01:21 solutions than many of those than I can.
1:01:23 So uh if someone disagrees with
1:01:25 something I always try to understand why
1:01:27 and then maybe together we can come up
1:01:29 with a better solution or maybe I can
1:01:31 explain my uh solution or perspective
1:01:34 better and that's feedback in of itself
1:01:36 as well. So that was like a summary of
1:01:39 persuasion 101 course, right?
1:01:42 Uh kind of. Yeah. I don't know how I
1:01:46 don't know if this is always applicable,
1:01:48 but you know in some situations you also
1:01:50 have to say it has to be this way
1:01:53 because of constraints that we cannot
1:01:54 discuss or something like that and then
1:01:57 you know there's not a lot of persuasion
1:01:58 other than we have to make a decision
1:02:00 then this is the decision. But more
1:02:02 often than not, I think it's more of a
1:02:05 factor of having that discussion and
1:02:07 together aligning on whether that's the
1:02:09 right solution or not if you have the
1:02:11 time to. In some cases, you have
1:02:12 constraints that force you to make
1:02:14 decisions very quickly and you have to
1:02:16 do those and uh be ready to fail, but
1:02:18 also be ready to learn from it and and
1:02:20 take responsibility and accountability
1:02:22 if it doesn't go well.
