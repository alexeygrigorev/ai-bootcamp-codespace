2:27 love sony sony image work which was
2:28 probably the best company i've ever
2:30 worked at
2:31 yeah cool so welcome to
2:33 our event
2:35 hey happy to be here yeah so before we
2:38 go into our main topic of being a
2:41 solopreneur let's start with your
2:43 background can you tell us about your
2:45 career journey so far
2:47 yeah so my background is i have probably
2:50 not a replicatable career
2:52 but i'll tell you my background is i
2:54 started
2:55 growing up in southern california my dad
2:58 worked in a television industry
3:00 and so he had a television production
3:02 company and so i would
3:04 go with him when i was 10 years old and
3:06 actually be the sound person or lighting
3:08 person editing so i learned a lot of
3:10 that stuff early on and then i
3:14 eventually actually was an editor for
3:16 abc network news in hollywood uh started
3:19 driving to work and and and edit the
3:21 news which at 18 was just
3:24 like crazy like really really crazy
3:26 uh and and i and i was offered a
3:28 full-time job but i decided to go to
3:30 college instead so that was kind of a
3:31 different life then i went to i was
3:34 always very interested in sports
3:36 and i had you know a period of time
3:38 where i
3:39 seriously wanted to either be olympic
3:41 athlete or a professional baseball
3:43 player a basketball player or a track
3:46 athlete so i had this whole period of
3:47 time where
3:48 like i was tempted by it and i studied
3:51 nutritional science in in college and
3:53 then after that i
3:55 decided to grow up and uh get a real job
3:58 so then i got a job at caltech
4:00 and worked there for a few years and
4:02 then i got a master's in at cal state la
4:04 so the public school right next door i
4:07 would go there at night um you know do
4:10 classes in
4:11 information systems which is i guess
4:13 kind of similar to data science today
4:15 and then uh because
4:18 you know at the time when you most
4:19 people know this in a university you
4:20 don't make a ton of money it was really
4:22 cool i met some really really smart
4:24 people there that i know even today but
4:26 uh i didn't
4:29 you don't want to make more money right
4:30 like so i so i i
4:32 i knew that i had all this experience
4:33 with tv and i combined all the python
4:36 and and all the stuff i learned in my
4:38 master's degree and all the stuff i
4:39 learned at caltech and i got a job in a
4:41 live tv so i worked in um
4:44 a live tv rental company for a bit
4:47 that was uh you know did things like the
4:49 big brother show and those kind of you
4:51 know those kind of shows
4:53 and then i transitioned to disney
4:55 feature animation worked there for a
4:57 while
4:57 building film pipelines then i then i
5:00 moved to sony and a lot of the film
5:02 pipelines this is something that's
5:04 pretty pretty rare that i guess in terms
5:06 of people don't know
5:07 is that
5:08 especially like in the year
5:10 early 2000s film film is probably the
5:14 most similar thing that exists to data
5:17 pipelines today almost identical
5:20 centralized file systems
5:22 linux python
5:23 all this stuff like we you know i hate
5:25 to be the guy that's got the graybeard
5:27 that says like we were doing this before
5:28 it's like we were doing this before we
5:30 already did this we already did all the
5:31 data pipeline stuff then i moved to
5:34 atlanta
5:35 was there for a little bit worked for
5:36 turner studios did some startup stuff
5:39 and then i moved to new zealand for a
5:41 year worked on avatar movie also film
5:44 pipelines high performance computing one
5:46 of the biggest super computers in the
5:47 world
5:49 i still am in contact with many of those
5:50 people from new zealand and they've
5:52 actually moved into
5:54 very similar industries right like
5:56 ml ops data engineering then i went to
5:58 the bay area i spent probably about 10
6:01 years there worked at startups got
6:03 another master's degree then started
6:05 teaching after i finished my startup and
6:07 then for probably 2017 or so so maybe
6:11 four years straight i've been just
6:13 working for myself through a variety of
6:15 different things
6:17 cool yeah that's the first time i hear
6:19 about i've done this before
6:22 i mean when it comes to pipelines but uh
6:25 when it comes like this is a totally
6:26 different perspective
6:28 from the movie industry so that's uh
6:30 that's pretty interesting
6:32 okay so since 2017 you've been uh
6:36 going to all right you've been solo like
6:37 a solopreneur
6:40 that's right yeah so who is a
6:42 solopreneur
6:43 yeah so what i what i would define as a
6:45 solopreneur is that i mean after i had
6:48 finished
6:49 you know working at a startup really
6:51 putting a lot of energy into it i was
6:53 essentially the first
6:55 non-founding person to work at the
6:57 company essentially
6:58 um there were some other people there
7:00 but like in terms of someone that just
7:02 went in and built the company from
7:04 scratch and
7:06 uh it took three years of time and just
7:09 i mean i put you know 100 hour weekend
7:11 hired all these people and we made money
7:12 millions of dollars and all the stuff
7:14 and then it just didn't work out and it
7:16 was a sports social network and i just
7:18 was done i was like okay i'm out i'm
7:20 gonna like because because i felt like
7:23 i had put everything in it and many
7:24 people there too had they had really
7:26 succeeded and made money and done all
7:28 this stuff like wait why am i doing this
7:29 for other people and also
7:31 why do i want to ask for permission to
7:33 be successful like why should i ask some
7:36 venture capitalist if i can work for
7:38 their company or why should i ask my
7:41 boss hey can i make more money like help
7:43 why don't i just make money myself so
7:45 that was that was the emphasis so
7:47 i think of solopreneurship just as
7:49 intentionally being small so not trying
7:52 to scale something to be really really
7:55 big
7:56 uh and in fact also building an
7:59 anti-fragile
8:01 uh way to make money so
8:03 just like with distributed computing
8:05 cloud computing you have load balancers
8:06 you have machines you know that you're
8:08 distributing the load
8:10 when you when you're solopreneur you
8:12 should always have you know ideally
8:14 maybe three of everything so three
8:16 consulting clients you know three
8:18 different things you're doing in
8:19 software three things like whatever
8:21 revenue stream diversify
8:24 because of the fact that it gives you
8:26 leverage and so not necessarily leverage
8:29 so that you can be a bad person and say
8:30 hey give me more money you know whatever
8:32 but it gives you leverage so if
8:34 someone's unethical for example this is
8:36 one of the things i was just talking to
8:37 a friend about even today even that um
8:41 one of the nice things about having
8:42 diversified revenue is if you don't like
8:45 the ethics of a company say bye
8:48 out
8:49 next
8:50 and i think that's one of the best ways
8:52 that we could change the world is if
8:54 people don't need to work for a company
8:56 like and and i could imagine many people
8:59 in the barrier in particular
9:00 you know they're maybe they they have a
9:02 2 million mortgage and then they're
9:04 working for a company they don't like
9:06 they know it's bad they know it's
9:07 hurting the world destroying it through
9:09 misinformation disinformation
9:11 and then they have no choice right
9:13 because they have a two million dollar
9:14 mortgage and so they have to
9:16 pretend that like oh no we're connecting
9:19 everybody
9:20 it's not bad you know like sure
9:23 like everybody learns about anti-vaxx
9:25 through our platform but you know
9:28 you have to kind of trick yourself like
9:29 into but if you have diverse forms of
9:32 revenue you just say no not going to
9:34 work for unethical companies so to me
9:36 that's part of it too is is that if you
9:38 stay small and have distributed forms of
9:41 income you can just i think live a a
9:43 better life
9:45 yeah interesting yeah i heard about the
9:47 book called the company of one i haven't
9:50 read that book um well i read like a
9:53 summary short summary and i think the
9:55 idea there is very similar to what you
9:57 said so you don't you intentionally want
10:00 to be small so you don't want to be like
10:02 the biggest company in the world or like
10:05 you you don't have these ambitions so
10:07 you just want to
10:10 you know be small
10:12 and
10:13 earn enough for to sustain like a good
10:17 lifestyle right
10:19 that's the the the same idea right
10:22 yeah i think it's very similar like in
10:24 it because
10:25 i think if you look
10:27 a lot of people are afraid to say what i
10:29 say because they they want to continue
10:31 to work in tech i'll say whatever i want
10:33 because i don't care
10:34 so the the tech company if you look at
10:36 the a lot of the vc companies they talk
10:38 about billion like paul graham's a great
10:40 example billionaires build you know etc
10:42 etc it's like well but what are they
10:44 building oh they're taking people
10:46 tricking them into working for less than
10:48 market rates and then taking the common
10:50 goods like in the case of those scooters
10:53 just throwing them on the sidewalks
10:55 leaving it for people like no you you
10:56 made the world a better a worse place by
11:00 taking something that was free and
11:01 exploiting it and a lot of the the
11:03 current uh venture capital world i'm not
11:06 i'm not against venture cap i love
11:08 people capitalism i love it i love
11:10 people making money being entrepreneurs
11:12 i i don't like the exploitative
11:15 uh venture capitalists who say we
11:17 disrupt it's like no you steal from
11:19 people and you steal the commons and you
11:22 exploit people by lowering their income
11:24 and it's like i don't want to do that so
11:26 so to me that's the opposite of that and
11:28 say no i don't want to become a billion
11:30 dollar company
11:32 through exploiting humans and exploiting
11:34 you know the open spaces like congestion
11:37 from uber and lyft and
11:39 in downtown san francisco no i don't
11:41 want to take over the people's sidewalks
11:43 you know like i don't i don't want to
11:45 hurt people and make the world a better
11:47 place or taking truth like you know
11:48 facebook is done completely monopolizing
11:51 truth flipping it turning it in into
11:53 falsehoods and then monetizing that it's
11:55 like no like you don't have to do that
11:58 so i think that's really the the i think
12:00 many people especially post kobe 19 it's
12:02 like
12:03 like why not just make the world a
12:05 better place and not work for companies
12:07 that make it a bad place
12:09 yeah and then another thing you
12:10 mentioned was like uh when you work at a
12:13 company you depend on somebody
12:15 making decisions for you like if you
12:17 want to get promoted like you have to
12:20 wait till somebody decides to actually
12:22 give you a raise right while if you work
12:24 for yourself
12:25 then yeah you just i don't find another
12:27 client or something like that right
12:30 yeah no exactly like i think there's a
12:31 lot of extremely talented people i mean
12:34 just amazingly talented people
12:36 who
12:37 are stuck in an or hierarchical
12:39 organization where someone that doesn't
12:41 have as much talent is their boss
12:44 and the boss's goal is to to to have
12:47 more power
12:48 and then all they do all day is they
12:51 they you know talk to other bosses and
12:53 then you know do this and this and this
12:54 and then so if someone knows what is
12:56 successful they have to ask someone's
12:59 permission to do something that's
13:01 obviously correct
13:03 and and that's
13:04 at some point i think if you're
13:06 extremely talented like many people i
13:08 meet
13:08 is you you you say wait wait a second
13:11 why would i ask this person to do the
13:13 right thing why don't i just do it
13:15 and and so that's really the idea as
13:17 well as if you
13:18 if you know you have actual talent
13:21 skills you can make money you can do
13:23 things then
13:24 then
13:25 hopefully at some point you ask yourself
13:28 wait why am i asking people
13:30 to do things it's just slowing me down
13:32 from making revenue or you know doing
13:36 things that i want to do
13:37 and i it and so i call this you know not
13:39 asking for permission to be successful
13:42 yeah
13:43 i'm really wondering how does your day
13:45 look like so what what do you do
13:48 usually
13:49 so i i generally
13:52 uh will try to exercise every single day
13:55 and wake up in the morning maybe maybe
13:57 do like a walk at the beach or
14:00 go rock climbing like i like to do
14:02 bouldering maybe lift weights i i find
14:05 that it's just critical to get
14:08 be fit and and i could even be i wish i
14:10 i'm pretty pretty uh
14:12 pretty fit but i could even be more fit
14:14 like i feel like that's one of the
14:15 things that's really really important
14:18 is to take care of yourself so get sleep
14:20 take it you know
14:22 wake up do some exercise and then after
14:24 that
14:25 i just have a list i have a list of
14:26 things i need to do you know hey i need
14:28 to write on a book chapter or oh i need
14:30 to
14:30 to contact this person about this
14:32 project i'm working on and so it's just
14:34 a queue of work and the queue sometimes
14:37 is very big sometimes there's no queue
14:39 and i i don't process the queue and it's
14:42 really like a a prior to prioritization
14:45 thing and then i work through that
14:46 throughout the day so some days i'll
14:48 just decide hey you know i don't want to
14:49 do things maybe it's a tuesday
14:51 uh i was doing a lot of work over the
14:53 weekend
14:54 i'll just do nothing i'll just go sit at
14:56 the beach and so that's that's the other
14:58 thing too is i try to
15:00 be very careful about
15:02 you know
15:02 not
15:04 not biting off more than i can chew
15:06 because
15:07 their work is infinite right the work is
15:10 infinite if you work for yourself and so
15:12 you need to pace yourself
15:15 yeah that's that's interesting and uh
15:17 what kind of things you have on your
15:19 list on your in your queue like you
15:21 mentioned writing a chapter then what
15:24 kind of other things you have there yeah
15:26 so so it'll be like you know whatever is
15:28 the most important that week so it could
15:30 be i like i'll put it on my ipad i'll
15:33 just have it right next to me i'll say
15:34 okay so after i work out you know or
15:37 maybe even go to the sauna just just
15:39 really kind of be relaxed start the day
15:41 like okay what i need to do okay i look
15:42 at the ipad and i write it down i just
15:44 say okay i need to send some emails to
15:46 these people okay there we go and i
15:48 write then oh i need to set up this this
15:51 thing that i'm working on for a project
15:52 and or maybe i need to write some code
15:54 and i just write a list of like maybe
15:56 like five things and then i go through
15:58 as i work through the day i just cross
16:00 over the list and then that's it that's
16:02 that's really the the the plat now if
16:04 there's something more complex
16:07 i wouldn't necessarily put the the
16:09 complexity into the to-do list
16:12 i'll put into a spreadsheet and you know
16:14 i have projects that are very complex
16:16 projects that take a year to finish but
16:18 i'll say work on the project and do this
16:20 part of the project so that's really
16:22 just my like my board it's just a very
16:24 simple ipad and i cross things out
16:27 what kind of projects are you working on
16:29 are these clients client projects your
16:31 own projects uh like your small
16:33 businesses or
16:35 a whole variety like i mean so basically
16:38 a lot of what i you know i do i i've
16:40 done different things different years
16:42 but
16:43 uh sometimes i'll be
16:45 you know doing doing training so i do a
16:47 lot of
16:49 work with o'reilly a lot of work with
16:51 other companies as well like teaching
16:53 things that that i know like mlabs data
16:56 you know data engineering devops python
16:59 so so i do a reasonable amount of those
17:01 kind of projects where you have to say
17:02 okay here's what i'm going to build and
17:04 then i also am working on courses so i
17:07 do a lot of work with coursera
17:09 and so those those take a while that
17:11 could that could take you know maybe six
17:13 months and i'm working with a group of
17:14 people we meet every week we do a little
17:16 bit more work
17:17 uh also some consulting projects so like
17:19 maybe i'm working with a company and
17:21 building some solutions for them so so i
17:23 try to i and then i have you know other
17:26 things like i teach at universities and
17:27 so those those sometimes i'll have to
17:29 build a new course or do some do some
17:31 curriculum but i try to keep it
17:33 so that i
17:35 that when you do work for yourself as
17:36 well you have to be careful to focus
17:39 more
17:40 of your time on exponential versus
17:43 [Music]
17:45 uh logarithmic
17:46 work right so
17:48 in the case of
17:50 if you're working on something like in
17:52 my case
17:53 a course or a book or something that has
17:55 exponential potential right because many
17:57 people could read it um you know or if i
18:00 put something on youtube or i put it on
18:02 linkedin uh if it's consulting work
18:05 that's that's still good if i'm learning
18:07 something and i'm and i'll be able to
18:09 apply that later but i but i cap the
18:12 consulting type of work so that it
18:14 probably wouldn't consume more than
18:16 maybe 20 of my available time
18:18 i try to do 80 of my work as more
18:21 exponential i mean it's not perfect it's
18:22 not like i'm perfectly doing this but in
18:25 general i try to limit and cap and be
18:27 very very selective
18:28 about the consulting work i do
18:30 because it's not scalable
18:33 but i'm wondering
18:35 maybe i'm wrong but this 20
18:38 of non-scalable work is this what makes
18:41 most of the money or it's actually
18:43 courses and like it's uh it's different
18:47 it it depends i mean it really it really
18:49 depends on you know what the year is or
18:51 or what it what it is i'm working on
18:53 i i think of it more of
18:56 like
18:57 if you were going to
18:59 spin
19:00 um
19:02 like a like a a distributed computing
19:05 job let's say you spun up many processes
19:08 on let's use python we say
19:09 multiprocessing module
19:11 you write a function and then you have a
19:13 bunch of functions that go into a
19:14 process pool
19:15 it's non-deterministic right it could be
19:17 oh maybe this process it takes like you
19:20 know a long time and it consumes a lot
19:22 of cpu and then you have another process
19:24 finished really quick and then another
19:26 one's more medium i think that's the way
19:28 to think about
19:30 work is that
19:32 if you have some things where you don't
19:34 necessarily
19:35 need to be thinking about them and there
19:38 and they have some form of exponential
19:40 potential
19:41 or at least
19:42 linear or super linear potential like
19:45 renting a property out that's not bad i
19:47 mean it's not exponential potential but
19:48 at least maybe linear or or super linear
19:51 uh right
19:53 and and then you also have some things
19:55 that are maybe could take a long time to
19:57 work out like if you write a book i mean
19:59 who knows i mean maybe it's a dud maybe
20:01 maybe it does nothing
20:02 so so
20:04 i think that's the trick though is a
20:05 very very similar to
20:07 to doing um
20:08 you know computer science distributed
20:11 computing is that you have to think
20:12 about things in terms of
20:15 uh
20:16 you're okay with whatever happens
20:18 like that but but you but you have lots
20:20 of different work
20:22 in parallel happening
20:24 and and it just it doesn't really matter
20:26 which one is
20:28 necessarily like a big a big win because
20:30 the the the thing that you have to be
20:32 careful about with
20:35 with consulting is it's very tempting to
20:38 to to make start making a lot of money
20:40 from a consulting client and then
20:43 that's all you do and then you're not
20:45 actually
20:46 a solopreneur anymore you're working for
20:48 somebody else this is called something
20:49 different
20:50 and
20:51 when you work for someone else even as a
20:53 consultant
20:54 even if it's a lot of money let's say
20:56 half a million dollars a year a million
20:57 dollars a year as a consultant then you
20:59 can't do anything that's exponential
21:01 like you you're you're so you don't have
21:04 you're basically you're you're your
21:05 virtual machine
21:07 is the cpu is 100
21:08 right so you can't you can't spawn
21:10 anymore processes on that machine that's
21:12 all it does
21:14 so you don't have the opportunity
21:16 to to profit from some kind of
21:19 exponential work and so that's again why
21:21 i try to limit
21:22 the the consulting to to be it's good
21:25 because you learn things when you do
21:26 consulting it's really fun you make
21:27 contacts i love consulting but but that
21:30 you're you at least for me personally i
21:32 mean there's people that do consulting
21:34 that's all they do
21:35 but i want to save most of my time
21:38 for exponential work
21:41 because i'm a book author myself so i've
21:44 written three books
21:46 two of them are doing pretty bad so they
21:50 like last quarter so my mastering java
21:52 for data science book
21:54 so like 10 copies were sold probably you
21:58 know like it's nice to have to to to
22:01 write a book but then if nobody buys it
22:04 so it's not like
22:06 you know what are the best sellers uh
22:07 right now so i'm not making
22:10 any money from this book so then another
22:12 book that i have is like um maybe i have
22:15 300 uh yeah 300 per month from this book
22:18 so it's also not impressive
22:21 um
22:22 yeah so that's why like if
22:25 you invest a lot in these exponential
22:28 things but none of them necessarily give
22:30 you exponential return at the end
22:33 yeah i think i and so i think that's
22:35 that's a good thing you bring up which
22:37 is that
22:38 there is no silver bullet right like so
22:42 uh 300
22:44 a month for example
22:46 is probably not going to make many
22:49 people be able to survive but
22:52 what if you had 10 300
22:55 a month
22:56 right then now now it's interesting
22:58 right now now it's interesting now but
23:00 but this is i think the dilemma
23:02 of this the cold start problem it's like
23:05 it's like saying you're building a
23:06 company and you want to get a bunch of
23:08 users
23:09 and you say hey we have such awesome
23:11 technologies people would love the thing
23:13 we built but no one no one's here no
23:15 one's no one's using it yeah you have to
23:17 that's that's the hard part that's
23:19 that's that's the hard part is that
23:21 they're in there there's probably no
23:23 perfect formula for
23:24 for how do you how it could take
23:27 you know it could take a few a few years
23:29 it could take and it could be that maybe
23:31 a book does nothing and who cares if the
23:33 book does nothing if you if you're very
23:35 like opportunistic because there's other
23:37 things you could do
23:38 that are beyond just writing a book like
23:41 right you could write an application on
23:42 the ios store and put it there who knows
23:45 maybe someone buys it like so it it but
23:48 but it's really the i think it's more of
23:50 a mindset which is that
23:53 do you want it's a little bit like the
23:55 if if anyone's heard of them the movie
23:57 the shawshank redemption
23:59 where you know the the lead the lead
24:02 person in in the in the movie
24:04 tim robbins is falsely imprisoned for
24:07 life in a very bad prison and bad things
24:10 happen to him and then he he he works
24:12 for a while he works for a long time
24:15 digs his way out with a spoon and
24:17 escapes
24:18 and i think the thing about
24:21 escaping from working for
24:23 unethical corporate companies is is you
24:27 should think of the movie the shawshank
24:29 redemption
24:30 and and you need to build the poster and
24:32 you need to use the spoon
24:34 any and it's going to take some time and
24:36 you're going to need to dig that tunnel
24:38 but but but what what do you have now
24:40 you're free you you so freedom isn't
24:42 like
24:43 that they have the expression freedom
24:45 isn't free like if you want to be able
24:47 to wake up every morning
24:48 look at the sun walk at the beach walk
24:51 in the park decide what it is you want
24:52 to work
24:54 like it will it will require sacrifice
24:56 and so if you don't want to be free just
24:58 stay in prison just stay inside just
25:00 like the other character that women
25:04 yeah
25:05 okay so to sum up so what you're doing
25:08 is uh you're doing courses uh like
25:11 coursera and then also universities then
25:14 you're
25:14 doing a lot of training and teaching
25:16 through
25:17 um o'reilly like about envelopes data
25:20 engineering and then you also do a bit
25:22 of consulting so you try to
25:24 uh devote 20 of time to consulting and
25:27 then the rest
25:28 would go to your teaching activities
25:30 right is there anything exactly
25:32 is that yeah and there's more yeah
25:33 there's more and so the other thing too
25:35 is that so that's that's the formula and
25:38 i think anybody could have their own
25:39 formula you don't have to there's
25:41 nothing magical about that that for
25:42 formula in fact you could
25:44 you could only do consulting and and
25:47 especially now
25:49 i would recommend if you only did
25:50 consulting maybe you have
25:52 um maybe you have three maybe have three
25:54 consulting uh your clients that and then
25:57 that and you could do very well like
25:59 maybe you in fact i was watching a
26:01 really good show
26:03 uh called comedians and cars and jay
26:05 leno was on it and and you can listen
26:08 learn a lot about solopreneurship by
26:11 watching that show listen very very
26:13 carefully because a comedian is very
26:15 similar they're doing the same thing
26:18 they're they're they make money on
26:20 shows that's what i do right like a book
26:23 or a course but they also do it in
26:24 person so they have to they have to do
26:26 the work right they have to teach it
26:28 they have to learn to learn the material
26:30 and then jay leno may have like a kind
26:32 of a contract or consulting job with his
26:34 tonight show and what he said is he
26:35 always
26:36 banks one job and works another so one
26:39 job he puts in the bank and so that's
26:42 that's the other part of the trick is
26:43 that so so yeah i have money right i
26:46 have i put money in the bank and it's in
26:48 investments and i also have you know
26:50 other projects that i'm working on that
26:52 that pay out so you know real estate
26:54 stocks you know cash all those kind of
26:56 things
26:58 that the more you have of that the more
27:01 chances you can take and the more
27:03 flexibility
27:04 you have to work on exponential things
27:06 so i think
27:07 if you don't have some kind of a reserve
27:10 of cash and have low expenses so you
27:13 know if you're living in the bay area
27:14 paying seven thousand dollars a month to
27:16 rent a house in you know marin county
27:18 um probably should move probably should
27:21 move right because you you you're now
27:23 all of your money is going to
27:25 to pay for your living expenses where
27:27 you could potentially have very low
27:29 living expenses and then you have a lot
27:31 more flexibility to to work on other
27:33 things
27:34 where do you live now atlanta or i live
27:37 i live in um uh north carolina raleigh
27:39 north carolina okay so it's uh is it
27:42 cheaper than bay area
27:44 like like i would say like
27:46 you know
27:48 25
27:49 of the bay area probably
27:52 okay yeah that's uh that's
27:54 that's nice
27:56 we have quite a lot of questions and uh
27:59 the first question is
28:00 we have is
28:02 how do you structure your day i think we
28:03 talked a bit about that but the other
28:06 part of the question how you set your
28:08 goals and go about them so
28:12 like yeah you have any system for you
28:15 know like this thing
28:17 has exponential uh
28:20 like
28:21 potential right so actually yeah i mean
28:24 definitely i mean i would i try to
28:27 i would say the two thing i mean again
28:29 this is just for me and it would be very
28:31 different for other people
28:32 is that
28:33 i try to focus
28:36 my time
28:37 teaching one of the reasons i'm teaching
28:39 is it's not very lucrative i mean no one
28:41 makes money
28:42 almost nothing teaching but the reason i
28:44 do it is a it's it's enjoyable so it
28:47 makes me happy because i'm helping
28:48 people and i'm also learning what people
28:50 want to want to know
28:52 um and so so that's one component is i
28:54 get that as a as a
28:56 i kind of learn what it is i need to
28:58 teach people but then in terms of
29:00 choosing my goals yeah i think
29:02 exponential you know potential would be
29:04 a big one so if so if i have a
29:06 two two projects one project says hey
29:09 you know i want you to work on this
29:11 thing that um you know 500 people
29:14 will see for my special new startup
29:16 platform
29:17 or hey you can develop a coursera course
29:20 that we could reach you know i don't
29:22 know how many people on a coursera like
29:23 200 million people then i choose
29:25 coursera because there's there's 200
29:27 million people
29:28 uh so so definitely the scale is a huge
29:32 component in choosing the goals but then
29:34 also as i mentioned before
29:36 um not to be self-righteous or anything
29:38 but like like i also if if i feel like
29:41 there's unethical technology and i don't
29:43 have a huge list here i'm not like like
29:45 i have like oh i won't do this and this
29:47 is but like again facebook's a good one
29:49 like anything to do with facebook like
29:51 nope next
29:52 right so i i want to have some capacity
29:54 when my goals were like am i am i making
29:57 the world a better place or am i
29:59 destroying it
30:01 i'm fortunate to be in the place where i
30:03 can choose to not work on things that i
30:06 feel like are destroying the world so
30:07 that's that's that is the ethical
30:09 component the exponential component and
30:11 then also like
30:12 also if like you know is there a
30:14 capacity
30:16 for me to to work on things
30:18 asynchronously so if someone's like hey
30:20 we're even if someone was going to pay
30:22 me a lot of money and they're like yeah
30:24 you're going to need to show up to a
30:25 meeting
30:26 i don't know two hours a day
30:28 every single day for the next year i'd
30:31 say no sorry i just don't want to do
30:33 that i i don't i don't want to just show
30:35 up and like no matter how much money you
30:37 give me like uh i mean
30:39 there probably would be a limit where i
30:41 would probably say well temporarily i'll
30:43 do it but i just don't want to show up
30:44 and sit in a meeting or do nothing like
30:47 so i also try to focus more on
30:49 asynchronous work as well
30:51 so and then when you feel like not
30:53 working you would just spend time on on
30:55 a beach instead exactly sitting on a
30:57 meeting yeah
30:59 and how
31:00 how do you keep focus and motivation
31:02 because when you work alone it's uh
31:04 sometimes it's hard
31:06 yeah and it's true i mean i think it's
31:08 the thing is it's it's you don't have to
31:10 be perfect right i mean like sometimes
31:13 one week i will be is not as productive
31:15 and then some some weeks i'll be really
31:17 really productive
31:18 and so i think part of it is just being
31:20 okay with with the fact that you don't
31:21 have to be perfect you i mean
31:24 and then i think the other other
31:25 alternative the other part of it is that
31:28 naturally
31:29 you know as you you you get projects you
31:32 have to finish it i mean it's like
31:34 if you think about most people
31:37 they brush their teeth every day and
31:39 they take a shower and like you know
31:41 like you have no choice you have to do
31:43 this right like if you're if you're
31:44 working on a project and it's got a
31:46 deadline you have to do it there's i
31:47 mean so there isn't like really a lot of
31:50 wiggle room in terms of of stuff so
31:52 that's probably one of them as well uh
31:55 and then
31:56 i think
31:58 also if you're happy about the thing
32:00 you're working on and that's why i
32:00 mentioned that not being involved in
32:02 meetings and like
32:04 you know bs work or like the people
32:06 you're working with or are very
32:08 unpleasant or unethical
32:10 then like yeah it's not gonna be
32:11 motivational like you know if someone's
32:13 like hey let's figure out a way to
32:15 spread even more
32:17 uh anti-vaccine information on facebook
32:20 and we're gonna like really get grandma
32:21 to like click on this link that like
32:24 makes her not take the vaccine it's like
32:25 no i think i'm not gonna do that like
32:28 i'm gonna i'm gonna focus on
32:30 on stuff that makes me happy i feel like
32:32 i'm doing
32:33 you know good work and i think that's a
32:35 big part of it is if you're able to
32:37 be really happy about what you're
32:38 working on the motivation will come
32:41 and how much time do you spend working
32:45 every week like on average is it more
32:48 than 40 or less
32:49 yeah that's a good question i would say
32:52 i would say probably 40 50 hours is
32:55 probably what i work
32:57 on average it could be it could be
32:59 really wild for for i mean mostly 40 50
33:02 but maybe one week i work 10 but and
33:04 then some weeks maybe i work 80 but but
33:06 typically it would be yeah 40 50.
33:10 because i imagine if you're working on a
33:11 book and then there is also a course and
33:13 then there is also a client
33:15 and i know that
33:18 maybe for you it's easier because you've
33:19 written
33:20 many books but sometimes like for me i i
33:24 was talking a lot with writing because i
33:26 know that hey now the publisher is
33:28 pressuring me and i really need to sit
33:30 down and write it but it's just so
33:32 difficult for me to sit down and write
33:34 it and then there is also this other
33:36 project like the client is uh i don't
33:38 know messaging you saying hey when we
33:40 would be ready and then you also have a
33:42 course and then people are waiting for
33:45 this course and then yeah so uh i
33:48 imagine yeah i i i've been you know oh
33:50 yeah i've had all that but what i would
33:52 i would say what i what i think about
33:54 i think it's just it's just a
33:56 perspective is that
33:58 whatever i think about that it's like oh
33:59 i gotta do this course i gotta do this i
34:01 got this all this stuff oh the way i
34:03 think about it is like the suffering
34:04 that i'm undergoing you know of like wow
34:07 i really feel pressure you know etc etc
34:10 it's it's actually like a reminder of
34:13 how good my life is
34:14 so so like the fact that
34:17 the um people want me to do work for
34:19 them and i have all these different
34:21 projects that i don't have a boss
34:24 it's almost like a reminder it's like
34:25 hey remember you don't have a boss you
34:26 can do anything you want oh okay and
34:29 then it's like i'm happy it's like oh i
34:30 get to work really hard yeah this is
34:32 great so i think it's just a way of
34:33 looking at it is like the more pressure
34:36 you're on under when you're working for
34:38 yourself that that's actually that
34:40 that's a sign that you're you're
34:42 successful
34:43 okay and then since you don't have a
34:45 boss you can just say
34:46 you can just stop working on this at any
34:48 time right
34:49 yeah just do what you want i mean do do
34:51 you know try your best and like if you
34:53 know obviously you can't just not do
34:55 things but like you know things happen
34:57 and you can always tell someone if
34:58 you're really really overwhelmed you
35:00 just can't finish it you just be honest
35:02 and say hey
35:03 i'm a little bit slow on this one i
35:04 really apologize i'm never late most of
35:06 the time
35:07 you know give me a couple more weeks i'm
35:09 finishing up this other project
35:11 yeah just there's nothing to you know
35:13 it's yourself right you you can just
35:16 you can be as nice to yourself as you
35:18 want you can be mean to yourself or you
35:20 can be nice to yourself why not be nice
35:23 okay
35:24 so
35:25 since you how many books have you
35:28 written so far um
35:30 i think we're
35:32 eight books maybe i think i've run eight
35:34 books i've done three for o'reilly
35:37 one for pearson and then i did four
35:40 self-published books so i think it's
35:42 about eight oh cool so
35:45 how does the like what's your
35:47 self-publishing experience
35:49 like i said but i think i think
35:51 self-publisher
35:53 i think you know there obviously are
35:55 benefits to doing uh with a publisher i
35:58 mean i would say i'd probably prefer
36:02 to to
36:03 have a combination of both where
36:05 i would say every 18 months or so i i
36:08 want to try to publish like a a book
36:10 with a publisher right at least for me
36:11 which is which is uh maybe a very
36:13 unusual i don't think most people that's
36:15 even
36:17 probably a good advice
36:18 because it's a very specialized uh thing
36:21 to do but part of it is that i'm i'm
36:23 as a consultant i i'm spending all my
36:26 time trying to be at the cutting edge
36:28 and so i like i like working with
36:29 publishers like o'reilly i really like
36:31 that company i think they're ethical i
36:33 like the founder of o'reilly i like the
36:34 president over i like everyone they're
36:36 very very good people to work with so
36:38 it's fun for me every 18 months now if
36:41 i'm also just happen to be working on
36:43 something
36:44 and it makes it easy to put it into a
36:46 book yeah why not so so i think of the
36:48 self-publishing more of like
36:50 kind of uh like accidental
36:53 products you know where it's like hey i
36:55 already have this stuff why don't i just
36:56 put it into a book and then the
36:58 publishing stuff is a little more
37:00 intentional and a little more serious
37:02 and i think the quality definitely
37:03 improves when you have
37:06 really really talented people like
37:07 o'reilly for example working with you
37:10 yeah and also pressure from the
37:12 publisher i guess helps
37:14 because like if i didn't have a
37:16 publisher for my last book i don't think
37:18 i would have finished it like i would
37:21 just give up but then since they were
37:22 constantly
37:24 uh writing me saying hey what's the
37:27 how is this chapter five going then yeah
37:30 one day i'll just would sit and finally
37:32 finish it
37:35 yeah i think i mean it doesn't it
37:36 doesn't it doesn't hurt i think
37:38 again i don't know if
37:40 it's
37:41 maybe good advice to tell people hey
37:43 write a bunch of books because as you
37:44 mentioned like
37:46 i think it's probably lower probability
37:48 of like a lot of income it's more
37:50 prestige when you when you write a book
37:52 but for me which is in a very
37:54 specialized
37:56 unique area that i'm in i just happen to
37:58 be
37:59 spending all my time learning the latest
38:01 stuff and so it's an artifact of what
38:04 i'm already doing
38:05 to write books
38:07 and yeah so the the question that we
38:10 have is also about the book so the
38:12 question is how do you plan books
38:14 because it takes a lot of time and then
38:16 on like you have a topic let's say
38:18 envelopes your latest one um your latest
38:21 book so then there is a topic like a big
38:24 thing right and then you somehow need to
38:25 chunk it to understand which chapters
38:28 are there
38:29 um
38:30 then yeah and then for each chapter you
38:32 need to put something concrete so how do
38:34 you go about doing this
38:37 yeah i think that's a good question the
38:38 the step one you must do an outline must
38:42 if you don't build an outline you will
38:43 not build a book
38:45 so that's
38:46 by far the most important part and it's
38:48 pretty easy like um
38:50 when you
38:52 if you want to flush out if anyone ever
38:54 wants to write a book with you and you
38:55 want to figure out if they're serious or
38:56 not just ask them to help build an
38:59 outline the people that will never write
39:01 anything won't do it
39:03 so that's an obvious one like it's a
39:05 great way to weed people out once you
39:06 got the outline then
39:08 i personally like to build
39:11 projects first so i would build some
39:13 projects for the chapter maybe put those
39:15 in github
39:17 and then once i built the projects then
39:18 to me the the book writes itself right
39:21 and then you just go through you
39:22 describe what you're working on you you
39:23 say this and this and this especially if
39:25 you're already you know doing that work
39:28 like let's say you're working at twitch
39:30 for example and you're a backend
39:31 engineer i just happen to know someone
39:32 works at twitch we're back in engineer
39:34 and you're doing a bunch of stuff with
39:36 http apis and you're already doing this
39:38 documentation for work and you're doing
39:40 all the stuff like you already wrote it
39:43 it's you may not
39:44 it be exactly but like you wrote it
39:47 somewhere already and or it's in your
39:49 mind just do this i think a lot of times
39:51 people
39:52 they they get stuck and they hurt
39:54 themselves mentally they're like oh no
39:56 it's so stressful but it's like wait
39:58 don't reinvent something that's the
40:00 other part is like don't don't do work
40:01 really hard
40:03 do things you already know how to do
40:05 that
40:06 people you think that people won't think
40:08 it's interesting because
40:10 because they're not in your brain
40:13 but but
40:14 most people
40:15 don't know what's in your brain and so
40:17 you just need to take what's in your
40:18 brain put it on the piece of paper and
40:20 so i would say those are probably the
40:22 main tips that i would have yeah it
40:24 sounds easy but uh taking something out
40:26 of your brain and putting this on paper
40:28 takes time and
40:30 yeah so how often do you publish books
40:32 like is it every year i think you said
40:33 every year and a half right
40:35 yeah year year and a half
40:37 that's like i think for me it's like the
40:39 last several years i've definitely done
40:41 that at least a book a year
40:43 um and so it's again it's more of like a
40:46 like a um
40:48 a combination of
40:50 it's enjoyable to me to do it and
40:53 like i have the time to do it
40:55 and
40:56 that's
40:57 part of my strategy of
41:00 just
41:01 forcing it's really like a goal it's
41:03 like so if you said to someone hey why
41:05 do you run marathons like most people
41:07 know someone that's running a marathon
41:08 like why do you do it well it's just
41:10 something to do right like it's like i
41:12 train i train for the marathon and
41:14 i have a race at the end of the year and
41:16 like it keeps me like it's just like
41:18 kind of a fun thing to do to to stay in
41:20 shape is to run a marathon i think
41:22 writing a book if if you do become
41:24 someone like me like writing a bunch of
41:26 books
41:27 it's just a great way to be relevant
41:29 right and stay up to date is just keep
41:31 writing a book
41:33 yeah so still taking
41:35 uh
41:36 stuff out your out of your brain and
41:38 then putting on paper
41:40 requires uh
41:42 time right and then also practice and
41:44 skill and then
41:45 yeah eventually you become better at
41:47 this yeah well i mean it's the same like
41:49 if if again if anyone has ever run a
41:51 marathon
41:52 it's not that the marathon is actually
41:54 difficult i've run seven
41:56 that um
41:58 it's that you think
42:00 it's difficult but the real issue is
42:03 that it's self-discipline like you just
42:05 have to get your body used to running
42:06 for a couple hours probably and once you
42:09 can run for a couple hours you can run a
42:10 marathon
42:11 and so it's it's really like just the
42:13 feedback loop of oh yeah it's actually
42:15 not that bad because a lot of running a
42:17 marathon in particular
42:19 is that your mind is like telling you
42:21 this is bad your body hurts so bad no
42:23 stop this you know it's like it's
42:25 tricking you it's tricking you telling
42:27 you like oh this is all but it doesn't
42:29 hurt it's not bad and it's relaxing and
42:31 you can just run and run for a couple
42:33 hours and just relax same thing like
42:35 really a book is not that bad but it's
42:37 it's you think it's bad and so you
42:39 torture yourself
42:40 but but actually you just have to do it
42:42 you just have to put it onto paper
42:44 um but but the more you do it the more
42:47 you realize like yeah of course it takes
42:49 some effort but it's not as bad as i
42:51 think people think the more you do it
42:54 yeah so there is a question about
42:56 distributed income and
42:59 so
43:00 sure and the question is about can you
43:03 give some tips how to
43:04 get this distributed income i think we
43:06 already talked
43:07 about books right which is uh one
43:10 piece of a puzzle let's say so like
43:13 because you let's say you have eight of
43:14 them it contributes something every
43:17 month
43:18 some books do well some books maybe
43:20 don't but overall eight books together
43:23 make something right and how do you go
43:26 about you know other pieces uh
43:29 i mean just any like i i do youtube
43:31 videos i make some money on that i
43:33 publish content to o'reilly i make some
43:35 money on that it's just it's just
43:37 basically an accumulation like if you're
43:40 if you're not in a hurry to make money
43:43 then then it's much easier to make money
43:46 if if you're if i think the the way
43:49 to never make money from distributed
43:51 income is to think like you're a
43:53 salaried employee right because when
43:55 you're salaried employees like i must
43:56 make 200 000 a year i can't live in the
43:58 bay area but that's the wrong way to
44:00 think for distributed income what you
44:02 should be thinking is
44:03 how can i make 200 000 a year in 10
44:06 pieces and it may take five years or it
44:10 may take three years to do it and it
44:11 doesn't it's even better if they're not
44:13 related
44:15 like so you know a book yeah maybe maybe
44:18 a book is a little bit maybe so let's
44:20 say you need to make ten thousand
44:21 dollars a month
44:22 uh maybe a thousand bucks from books
44:24 comes in but but what else could you do
44:26 right you could you could also build an
44:28 app right maybe the app gets lucky maybe
44:30 it does two thousand a month oh now
44:32 you're at three thousand okay now it's
44:33 like points on the board in a basketball
44:35 game okay what's next well maybe you
44:37 could
44:38 you could buy a duplex
44:39 and then you do a little consulting
44:41 first and you build up a lot of money
44:43 you you buy a duplex you rent out one
44:45 side oh no now you have another 2 000.
44:47 now you're up to 5000. and then
44:48 eventually you add up the pieces and
44:51 they're all different and co they're
44:53 they're unrelated right so the real
44:54 estate market all of a sudden goes oh
44:56 it's horrible who cares you have the
44:57 other money
44:58 likewise the book nobody buys your books
45:01 who cares you have the real estate money
45:02 so that's that that's kind of the idea
45:04 is to be patient and to think about it
45:06 it may take a while it may take a while
45:08 to build up all the things uh but also
45:10 it's i think it's much much better to
45:12 not go all in on one thing
45:15 because anything can happen
45:17 and and
45:18 and
45:19 part of it again is probably lowering
45:20 your income
45:22 lowering your um expenses
45:24 by moving somewhere cheap and also
45:26 uh saving if possible a bunch of income
45:29 if you are working at some fang company
45:30 or something like that i mean like if
45:33 you could move
45:34 bank the majority of your money and then
45:36 you have a pool of cash way easier to do
45:40 all kinds of distributed income because
45:41 you have it's a lot like
45:43 like in california they have um all
45:46 these droughts but if you if you think
45:48 about it like how does the whole water
45:50 system work you have a lake
45:52 inside of the lake it's full of water
45:54 and there's water coming out and there's
45:55 water coming in to the lake right and so
45:58 you need a lot of water in the lake
46:01 if the water is coming out right and so
46:03 you need to put lots of streams feeding
46:05 into the lake so i think that's another
46:07 analogy is like
46:09 the bigger your lake is
46:11 the more time you have to find other
46:13 streams to put into the lake the smaller
46:15 the lake is the more
46:17 the more chances you have to take and
46:19 potentially get yourself in trouble so
46:21 it is helpful to have a pool of money
46:24 while you're getting started
46:26 yeah so but do you need to be
46:28 financially independent to to start like
46:30 do you need to have i don't know
46:32 so or you can start with uh being uh
46:35 like a full-time employee yeah yeah why
46:37 not yeah i i i think yeah why take
46:39 chances for no reason it would be like
46:41 the same thing if we go back to that
46:43 movie shawshank redemption
46:45 like it's like can you can you escape
46:47 prison
46:48 um
46:49 you know without digging a tunnel yeah
46:50 you can but what if you get caught
46:53 like so so it could be very risky right
46:56 but but
46:57 what he did was it was i think the right
46:59 strategy was he's going to take his time
47:01 doesn't take his time he's still he's
47:03 still pretending like he's happy every
47:05 day he's friends with the warden of the
47:06 prison just again be happy with your
47:08 boss meanwhile you're slowly digging
47:12 through the tunnel with a spoon
47:13 every day you take it out to the yard
47:15 drop it off into the dirt
47:17 but you there's no rush
47:20 and
47:21 what could be this tunnel for somebody
47:23 working as a full-time employee so book
47:26 course or
47:28 consulting geek or
47:30 b all book consulting i mean and again i
47:33 think that that's why
47:36 having
47:37 low expenses and a lot of money in the
47:39 bank like the more money the better
47:42 you you you can um
47:45 you you can basically
47:47 start to put streams into i mean here's
47:50 another example like if you have enough
47:52 money in the bank
47:53 you could buy a stock that gives you
47:55 dividends you're done
47:57 like right you get five percent of from
47:59 it in dividends per year right so
48:01 there's a lot of little streams that you
48:03 can put in
48:04 into it but i think a lot
48:06 i think from a
48:07 risk reward perspective yeah why
48:10 why blow yourself up and quit your job
48:12 and all this stuff if you have lots of
48:13 expenses
48:15 is this much better to slowly build
48:16 stuff yeah make it network with people
48:19 find out some consulting clients that
48:20 you can work with you know um maybe do a
48:23 little bit on the side have a side gig
48:26 maybe build an app maybe build a book um
48:29 you know maybe do rental property i i
48:31 think
48:32 again the more different it is than what
48:35 you do in in some sense the better like
48:38 if you if you had money in investments
48:40 like you know index funds or something
48:42 and then you had money in stocks and
48:44 then you also had some consulting
48:45 projects and all that was happening
48:48 while you're working at a full-time
48:49 company
48:50 and then you also have you know a good
48:52 reserve there and low expenses
48:54 a lot more flexibility to try things out
48:57 um
48:58 but yeah i think it's not necessarily in
49:00 an either or situation where you have to
49:02 say hey i want to work for myself and so
49:05 like i'm going to just go all in and and
49:07 like live off a credit card i i think
49:09 that's actually a very bad idea
49:12 yeah
49:14 what about like let's say you work
49:16 already 40 hours per week or whatever
49:18 maybe 50 60 hours per week
49:21 on
49:22 a company right for somebody
49:24 and then how do you find time to
49:25 actually do all these things you
49:27 mentioned well i guess one thing yeah so
49:30 if you have money you can invest
49:33 the money what if you don't have money
49:35 well uh so let's tackle both at the same
49:38 time or except one at a time so first
49:40 one is
49:41 that in terms of what would you do if
49:44 your company makes you work a lot hours
49:46 one is just work less
49:48 like just just don't don't work don't
49:50 work 40 hours a week what are they going
49:51 to do fire you
49:53 say no i work 40 hours a week that's it
49:55 that's one potential if that's not an
49:57 option just
49:58 hopefully you're able to just quit get a
50:00 job where you can work 40 hours a week
50:02 and then the problem solves itself i
50:04 think sometimes a simple solution
50:06 is obvious
50:08 and i think maybe startups in general
50:10 are a very bad bet for for most people
50:12 if you're financially independent
50:14 okay maybe a startup is okay but if
50:16 you're not financially independent and
50:17 you live paycheck to paycheck like why
50:19 work at a startup why not just
50:21 work somewhere that you don't have to
50:23 work 60 hours a week where you work 40
50:25 and then now you have 20 hours a week to
50:27 spend on yourself so i think that's a
50:30 big part of it another one is get rid of
50:32 the commute right so go go somewhere
50:33 where you can work remote i mean commute
50:35 could be two hours a day
50:37 so i think you can definitely figure out
50:39 a way to work less
50:41 at your job and also just be better at
50:43 it especially if you're remote i mean i
50:45 think most software engineers could
50:46 probably work four hours a day and be
50:48 totally fine and then you have you have
50:50 the rest of the day to do whatever you
50:52 need to do as long as you're really
50:53 efficient you know
50:55 zoned in you're caffeinated you're ready
50:57 to go just get your work done
50:58 so that's one part of it
51:00 the second one yeah with if you don't
51:02 have any money i would say it's pretty
51:04 simple profit and loss right is if you
51:06 don't have a lot of money in my opinion
51:07 get out of somewhere expensive
51:09 immediately go to the cheapest place you
51:11 can again because it's a it's a it's a
51:13 goal
51:14 delete your your expenses to 25
51:18 then now that you have low expenses now
51:19 you have money and then start putting
51:21 that money into the bank and save it i
51:22 mean that's that's the easiest possible
51:24 way to do it and then start building
51:26 more projects
51:27 but imagine let's say you work in the
51:30 bay area
51:31 and you have to live there right if you
51:33 go to some other place
51:35 then the salaries you have there are
51:38 lower well now i guess with the remote
51:41 work thing it's better but still
51:44 like in the bay area you get more money
51:46 but you have to pay more to live there
51:49 i mean if if that's true i mean well i
51:53 don't think that's the case i think
51:54 anybody that's in the barrier can move
51:55 but let's just say let's take the
51:57 experimental argument there i would say
51:59 okay then move to a bad part of the bay
52:01 area that's cheap right and move into a
52:05 smaller uh house and take another job
52:08 where you have to work less
52:10 because again it's like are you betting
52:11 on yourself or you betting on other
52:13 people
52:14 to me
52:15 i i think many vet talented people
52:17 should bet on themselves not their
52:19 company
52:20 and not that i have anything wrong with
52:21 companies although i would say that i
52:23 think
52:24 we're in a weird period period of time
52:26 where i think
52:28 you look at the the just insane ceo to
52:32 to employee ratio i i don't know what
52:35 the person the ceo of google makes but
52:37 it's it's
52:38 completely ridiculous like why should
52:40 the ceo of google make i don't know a
52:42 thousand times what an employee makes so
52:45 the contract is broken now if the
52:47 companies
52:48 made more more things like like a you
52:51 know
52:52 i don't know 50 times or they had a
52:54 little bit more of a reasonable
52:56 you know way that they
52:58 they compensated people's salary i think
52:59 it would be different but i
53:01 then i would say okay maybe you should
53:03 work at a company for a little bit
53:04 longer but i i personally think it's
53:06 broken and so why would you bet on this
53:09 company like they're paying the ceo a
53:11 thousand times what they're paying you
53:12 they don't care about you why don't you
53:14 just bet on yourself and so yeah it's
53:16 gonna take you're gonna have to juggle
53:18 things around but do you have an option
53:20 it's like the guy again in shawshank
53:21 redemption like it's it's like hey well
53:24 i don't like it that i'm in prison well
53:26 you're in prison
53:27 like i mean you can't like magically
53:30 aliens can't come from outer space and
53:32 transport you to a new planet you're in
53:34 prison what are you gonna do about it
53:36 right and so
53:37 what he did about it was he dug his way
53:39 out so it's going to take some some
53:42 stuff to to do
53:44 but you can do it if you're motivated
53:46 and and you're patient
53:48 okay
53:48 so um
53:51 let's get back to this person who wants
53:53 to get out of their type job and you
53:55 know start being a solopreneur
53:57 so
53:58 you said like put money in the bank
54:00 start investing right
54:02 then you can work on courses on books
54:04 and then you also mentioned you can
54:05 start getting consultant
54:07 consultant geeks right like consult
54:09 people
54:10 um
54:11 and uh yeah so once you have these
54:14 things when is the right time like how
54:16 do you know it's time to quit and uh
54:18 when you have enough money or
54:21 yeah yeah i think if you that's a good
54:23 way to do it right if you have if you
54:24 have enough money where you feel like
54:26 you can you you you're not putting
54:27 yourself into financial jeopardy then i
54:30 think that's a good time that you can
54:32 you can quit your job
54:34 because there's now like a balancing act
54:36 where
54:38 if you once you know you have the
54:40 ability to make money
54:42 then the more time you're at a company
54:44 you're you're losing your own money
54:46 right like that that's the one where
54:47 it's obvious it's like wait a second i'm
54:49 making way more money on the stuff i'm
54:51 doing on the side than i'm doing at my
54:54 company and i don't like my company and
54:56 like
54:57 it's just not exciting like
55:00 why am i here that that that's the
55:02 obvious time to quit
55:04 do you think a building network is
55:06 important for
55:08 being a solopreneur
55:09 yeah i think it's very important i think
55:11 you you need to be able to have trusted
55:13 people you work with like so i think
55:15 that's one of the benefits of having a
55:17 career
55:18 is that you get to know people you know
55:20 who's good who's bad you know you you
55:23 you you build a network so i think while
55:25 you are working at a company
55:28 i think my my recommendation would be
55:31 and this is probably non-conventional i
55:32 would say do not be a middle manager i
55:34 think it's very especially for
55:36 solopreneurship avoid any form of
55:39 management at all
55:41 because you're deleting your value and
55:43 so if you're able to focus on your
55:45 skills
55:46 get be as good as possible at your
55:48 company be so good at your company
55:50 that the people are just terrified if
55:53 you you left because of how competent
55:54 you are
55:55 and how good you are and reliable you
55:57 are and that helps build your network
55:59 and then also helps build your skill
56:01 like a good example would be you know
56:03 comedians right again if we go back to
56:05 them i think they're so fascinating for
56:07 to look at for technical people is is
56:10 the the person that's booking a famous
56:12 comedian like jerry seinfeld who cares
56:15 about that person nobody cares about the
56:16 manager nobody cares they want to see
56:19 jerry seinfeld do a comedy special right
56:22 so the same thing
56:23 if you think that the extra ten thousand
56:26 dollars a year twenty thousand dollars a
56:27 year you make as a manager
56:29 it is is does anything
56:32 you're mistaken because you're deleting
56:34 your value right like if jerry seinfeld
56:36 started managing other comedians instead
56:38 of you know improving his comedy no one
56:41 would care so
56:43 that that i think is also really
56:44 critical as you're moving is is
56:47 impress people
56:49 and get very good at what you do
56:51 so that you're extremely valuable
56:53 because what may happen as well is that
56:56 the opportunity may present itself in
56:57 the company
56:59 because
57:00 another person
57:01 wants to do some kind of side project
57:03 and hire you to do it they're like wow
57:04 you're the smartest person in the
57:05 company at this
57:07 in in the because you're just so
57:08 impressive then they give you a
57:10 consulting job it may just come to you
57:13 so the basically the the best tip for
57:16 building network is be good at things do
57:18 not go into middle management and just
57:20 talk to people around you
57:22 right exactly and i guess be visible
57:25 because if you're good at something then
57:27 you also should tell people about that
57:29 right otherwise they will not find uh
57:31 out about you yeah yeah well that's why
57:34 writing a book is is helpful right so
57:36 just be sl and i like like yeah just be
57:39 so good
57:40 that that people know who you are and
57:43 you know but maybe yeah maybe that's why
57:44 you write the book
57:46 uh but also in when you're at your work
57:48 as well avoid
57:49 you know because again if your mission
57:50 is to escape the prison
57:52 avoid anything that is
57:55 counterproductive to that goal so like
57:58 engaging in useless meetings
58:00 office you know water cool chatter
58:03 like company retreats anything that's
58:05 optional just delete
58:07 get better just get better
58:09 improve yourself because you you're
58:11 you're doing something different
58:12 everyone else is still
58:14 walking around the prison you're you've
58:15 got to go back to your cell and open up
58:18 that poster and start digging through
58:20 because you got to get out
58:23 yeah so i see that we should be wrapping
58:25 up but they have one question that i
58:27 really wanted to ask you
58:28 um how did you get into university and
58:32 start teaching there let's say somebody
58:34 wants like uh
58:35 like i for example i want to go to
58:37 university and start teaching while
58:39 still working or i don't know how it
58:41 happened to you like
58:43 how can people do this
58:45 yeah i think that's a great question i
58:46 think i mean part of it is is exactly
58:48 the advice i just said is be good at
58:50 what you do
58:51 and then people will reach out to you
58:53 that's right so if you're really really
58:54 good at a subject
58:56 and you were and and you stay in touch
58:58 with your professors right in your
58:59 networking and you write a book on it
59:01 in my case just professor came to me
59:03 that hey you teach machine learning can
59:04 you teach this class there we go and you
59:06 just teach a class so i think
59:08 just be very good network with your
59:10 professors write a book and it's very
59:12 likely someone may come to you and and
59:15 that's an easy way to to teach at a
59:17 university
59:18 okay sounds like writing a book is
59:20 helpful
59:22 it could be helpful yeah it could be
59:23 very helpful for that reason yeah for
59:25 many things yeah yeah so you mentioned
59:28 networking like for consulting then for
59:31 teaching and
59:32 and when you teach you network even more
59:34 because then the students know you and
59:36 like you have this exponential effect
59:38 it's just like a comedian
59:40 okay yeah right okay do you want to
59:44 say anything else uh
59:46 before we wrap up making advice happy
59:49 yeah just yeah just be really good
59:52 be good at what you do i think that's
59:53 the best advice i could give somebody
59:55 and bet on yourself
