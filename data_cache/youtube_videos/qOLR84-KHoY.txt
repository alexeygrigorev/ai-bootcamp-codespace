2:20 with product applications yes yes i left
2:23 it hard
2:24 like i am obsessed with the product
2:26 application of data science like that's
2:28 the area
2:29 i enjoy the most okay so welcome to our
2:32 event marianna
2:34 thank you lecture for having me yes like
2:35 i think

2:38 know you uh
2:40 thank you so much for having me it's an
2:42 honor to me like uh
2:44 i think you're doing a great job with
2:45 these data talks clubs and i think it's
2:48 just a year very recently so congrats on
2:50 that again
2:51 um
2:53 uh yes uh i'm i'm all yours right like
2:58 you're the driver now yeah so indeed
3:01 actually i wanted to
3:03 get somebody on
3:04 data talks club podcast to talk about
3:07 experience of transitioning from
3:09 individual contributor role to a manager
3:12 and they couldn't think of anyone better
3:15 for this conversation than you mariana
3:17 so yeah
3:18 but before we go into our main topic of
3:21 becoming a data science manager i wanted
3:23 to ask you about your background can you
3:25 tell us about your career journey so far
3:27 sure so
3:29 i'm a computer scientist by study okay
3:33 i did a master back in buenos aires
3:36 a long time ago
3:38 like more years than i would like to say
3:40 um
3:41 and
3:42 but i was already working as a software
3:44 developer more or less at the same time
3:46 as was doing college okay i
3:49 started
3:51 working first as a first as a data
3:53 analyst then as a
3:55 java developer
3:57 a web developer
3:59 even
4:00 [Music]
4:01 mobile you know a mobile games developer
4:04 okay
4:06 but
4:07 data was my passion okay and with doing
4:09 my masters i focus a lot of that and
4:11 ever since so that's how i jumped into
4:14 into applications of data science in the
4:16 industry
4:17 uh
4:18 mostly because i found it more
4:20 attractive to work you know
4:23 with something you could experiment very
4:25 often and if you did mistakes it was so
4:28 good and
4:30 and
4:31 that uh
4:32 you know that the targets were very
4:34 clear right objectives yeah for me i
4:36 found it very you know
4:38 uh assuring you know
4:40 um
4:42 then of course i changed the twice
4:45 companies working always in
4:48 the area of data science of
4:50 uh
4:51 personalize things around
4:52 personalization
4:54 recommenders um
4:57 you know marketing uh user segmentation
5:00 always around you know e-commerce we can
5:02 say okay
5:03 most of my experience in e-commerce and
5:06 then i tried to recent relax almost five
5:08 years ago
5:11 and i had amazing experience i
5:15 i moved across three countries and
5:18 worked with all type of you know i know
5:21 that's amazing all type of you know
5:23 people cultures projects um
5:27 uh you know endeavors even different
5:29 ways of
5:30 the largest organizations were also
5:32 different um it was super fun
5:36 so yes that's my summary
5:39 please interrupt me because well you
5:40 know me very well i can go for hours
5:42 without talking anything so
5:45 i was going to think how do i stop you
5:49 i'm just checking
5:52 so
5:53 tell us a bit more about what you do as
5:55 a manager so how does your day look like
6:00 uh
6:01 meetings uh like
6:04 like not not only meetings okay uh but
6:07 there is a huge component of spending
6:10 time with people nowadays
6:11 uh like
6:13 mo more than
6:15 than i would like to say okay more like
6:18 lots of meetings uh
6:20 but it's mostly because they they they
6:23 they are required now they are not you
6:24 know unnecessary meetings but they
6:27 you need to spend some time with people
6:30 also working on
6:31 you know
6:32 working on reviews and and planning
6:35 right of of
6:36 uh codes projects everything around
6:38 project management
6:40 uh
6:41 keeping you know the the large we we
6:44 work you know alex is a very large
6:45 company so some of the time it spends
6:48 uh
6:50 you know
6:50 writing the combination of reports
6:53 proposals like everything is very well
6:54 documented so
6:56 so there is some time on that
6:58 and and the largest company and the one
7:00 of the things i enjoy the most is the
7:02 mentoring and coaching and people
7:04 development okay like sitting
7:07 making sure that you help people keep
7:09 growing
7:10 and and being you know the best
7:12 professionals they can or they want
7:15 um
7:15 [Music]
7:17 so
7:18 i don't know i could i could go deeper
7:20 but i think that's summarized if let's
7:23 say i i
7:24 it's quite a lot of responsibilities
7:27 yes yes yes i uh
7:30 it takes it takes a bit of energy but
7:34 it's a good energy i really pay stock
7:36 okay
7:37 it's uh not not just monetary not only
7:40 monetary i'm talking about
7:42 everyday
7:46 you know the satisfaction of doing it
7:48 already you know helps into doing it
7:52 how large is your team how many people
7:53 do you manage yeah so so it's always
7:56 changing okay like uh
7:59 i think when i started it was when i
8:00 started this manager it was five then it
8:02 moved to
8:04 uh seven at some point then to four
8:07 now we are
8:08 i think it's eight to nine people okay
8:12 and they are all with different
8:15 seniority levels and and roles okay we
8:18 have
8:20 data scientists and machine learning
8:21 engineers okay
8:24 and we have junior and and for all of
8:26 them we have junior mid and senior uh
8:30 each of them you know uh covering
8:32 different different topics and aspects
8:34 and collaborating
8:35 with with the rest of the company right
8:39 so you said when you became a
8:42 data science manager you
8:44 uh five people reported to you so you
8:46 needed to manage five people
8:48 that's quite a drastic uh change from
8:50 having zero reports to having five
8:53 people reporting to you
8:55 yes yes uh yes like
8:58 i had some let's say experience before
9:01 that i mean not experience like cv
9:04 experience i'm not something i put on my
9:06 resume but i had some experience
9:09 mentoring and project management with
9:11 around two people
9:13 uh
9:14 like uh but it was like
9:17 uh
9:18 like let's say light level because they
9:20 were not reporting to me right so
9:23 jumping to five was yes was a stretch i
9:25 had to learn a lot
9:26 lucky thing i had many people to support
9:29 me okay
9:30 many people to mentor to guide me and
9:33 and i took an approach of you know
9:36 let's say
9:37 off
9:39 representing myself as somebody who was
9:41 learning okay and doing my best you know
9:43 to help and learning on the way together
9:45 with with everyone like
9:47 uh
9:48 like no by no mean i was you know
9:51 uh planning to take you know drastic
9:53 decisions or things like that we we
9:55 thought you know maybe consult on
9:57 someone first and discussing with the
9:59 team i was at that time i was you know
10:01 relying a lot
10:03 on other people to do it
10:06 but it was good luckily i got to work
10:08 with
10:09 like during the first year like my first
10:11 experience
10:12 i was super lucky
10:14 even though i didn't choose the team i
10:17 was super lucky with the people i got to
10:18 work with because
10:20 they
10:21 they helped me instead to me right i
10:23 helped them and they helped me
10:25 to grow right and
10:29 they were you know let's say they were
10:30 very ex
10:32 experienced
10:34 data scientists so so it was it was good
10:38 good experience very good experience
10:40 do you remember how it happened i guess
10:42 our manager came to you and said hey
10:45 mariana what do you think about managing
10:46 five people at once or how did it happen
10:49 to you
10:51 so
10:52 yeah a good point so at that point was
10:53 like uh
10:55 like
10:56 uh we need like we it was more like uh
11:00 are you interested in this okay like
11:02 this is something that interests you
11:04 and and uh say like it it will help you
11:08 know it will help the company a lot at
11:09 that point you know
11:11 uh it was a with with
11:14 my current manager andreas
11:16 and we needed to start you know uh
11:19 growing the team and
11:21 having you know more more people
11:22 training
11:24 and and yeah it was impossible like
11:26 after after seven or eight people like
11:29 it's already super hard to to manage
11:30 right like because
11:32 you're already distributing your time
11:34 across you know many people and
11:37 the you know the quality starts to drop
11:40 like that's something you learn right
11:42 after a certain amount of people that
11:44 you're managing like it's very hard to
11:46 to give
11:47 your
11:48 your food to them right
11:50 of course with more experience you can
11:51 do it better but still
11:54 there is a limit uh
11:57 so yes it was like that and i said
12:00 uh
12:01 i i i i sit around
12:04 okay let's shop right at that point i
12:06 was having a lot of fun in the company i
12:08 still do right but i mean at that point
12:10 i was like
12:12 like
12:12 like super excited about absolutely
12:15 everything i was like uh
12:17 one year in the company i just had to
12:19 move from argentina to berlin and i said
12:23 yeah let's do it yeah it was like
12:26 yeah it was summer that helped a lot you
12:28 know like
12:29 in summer you feel much more energized
12:32 so yeah i
12:34 was uh
12:35 i jumped in like
12:38 so you agreed and then uh i don't know
12:40 the next day you woke up uh being a
12:42 manager and with five people reporting
12:44 to you all right yeah
12:46 like what was the first thing you did
12:48 when you
12:49 found yourself managing the team
12:52 okay so
12:55 uh
12:56 i i think i got to know it a a few
13:00 months in advance but it was you know
13:01 until
13:02 until it's
13:04 it's not announced and it does not
13:05 happen you don't know if it's going to
13:07 happen
13:08 um
13:10 so as soon as i knew it i had like
13:14 like one month or so to prepare okay
13:18 myself and i luckily i was on vacations
13:20 part of that
13:22 luckily no well i used that that's the
13:25 thing right because i was so so excited
13:27 i used
13:28 not a lot maybe you know one or two days
13:31 of my vacation to write down my ideas to
13:35 to think
13:36 what will be my my first you know a few
13:39 you know
13:40 what things i will do how will i
13:42 structure like like
13:44 yeah
13:45 and i came like i i learned that you
13:47 know like there is uh
13:50 this practice of the
13:52 30 60 and 90 days right your plan on uh
13:56 like it's very like i'm i'm not
13:58 recommending to to stick to that always
14:01 saying like it should be the way
14:04 but it was a nice framework to follow
14:06 okay and to structure okay what i will
14:08 do in the first 30 days or the first 60
14:10 days like oh so then the first 30 days
14:13 is meeting all the team
14:15 having one-on-ones with all of them
14:18 and
14:19 i started reading a lot about you know
14:21 tips about manchester united i didn't
14:24 let's say drowned on it but i was trying
14:26 to see things here and there right of
14:28 things
14:28 that i shouldn't forget especially on
14:30 the tactical point of view right like
14:33 what to do
14:34 and
14:36 yes and then
14:39 midterm was learning about all the
14:40 projects they were working on making
14:43 sure that i was you know
14:46 like we didn't have to be in super
14:48 detail but i that i understood enough to
14:50 help them make decisions okay once
14:52 somebody they could count on
14:54 to take decisions
14:57 uh how did you organize that uh did you
14:59 ask them to onboard you did you go
15:01 through the code or what exactly did you
15:03 do there
15:05 because it's like
15:06 five
15:07 i don't know how many projects but uh
15:08 like five people i imagine it was like
15:10 three to five projects
15:12 for you that you maybe you didn't know
15:14 about before maybe more because because
15:17 it was people that was already in the
15:19 company
15:20 for some time so they
15:22 so all of them will have let's say one
15:24 act at least one active project
15:26 plus you know one or two or maybe three
15:29 of the ones you know they have already
15:31 put in production at some point and
15:33 where let's say maybe maintaining or
15:35 or doing so
15:37 uh it was a bit of everything let's say
15:39 for the i i
15:41 for some of them i asked them you know
15:43 to to on board me right maybe to spend
15:45 one hour explaining to me
15:47 uh
15:48 poor like i remember like well i don't
15:50 know
15:51 maybe at least maybe not like piater who
15:53 is still in the company right i don't
15:55 know how patient he was to explain me
15:57 you know
15:58 everything about advertising fabulous
16:00 where right how much they spend
16:02 uh throwing on the board and explaining
16:05 like what what they were doing i was
16:08 like it was very very challenging
16:10 because
16:12 it suddenly requires a lot of uh
16:14 activity right like
16:17 i i was thinking i was you know super
16:20 fast because i could jump into a new
16:21 project and learn it fast and do it
16:24 and but sadly i was some morning on on
16:26 two or three four projects at the same
16:28 time so i had to
16:30 be super you know awaken and
16:33 thing number one is was to
16:35 uh
16:37 let's say
16:38 uh accept that you won't have all the
16:40 information and that you
16:43 and to be handled and of course trusted
16:45 people right like to say
16:47 uh they they they are the ones doing
16:49 this right like and to say
16:51 always start you know if you have an
16:53 idea
16:54 always start assuming that
16:57 you may have a total misconception of
16:59 how the application or the or the
17:01 project you're working on works right so
17:03 you will start something like
17:06 based on what i understood okay because
17:09 i think maybe this could work but maybe
17:12 there you are starting with very wrong
17:13 assumptions because like while learning
17:16 things you know you have very partial
17:17 information
17:18 and
17:19 so
17:20 so that that that for me was important
17:22 do you remember how many times you were
17:24 wrong in your assumptions yeah many and
17:27 i went up to this day i'm usually more
17:30 wrong than right okay
17:33 like maybe maybe
17:36 but i don't stop proposing because
17:40 even if it's uh
17:42 wrong it triggers the discussion and i
17:46 think it structures knowledge around the
17:48 topic uh
17:49 [Music]
17:51 like
17:52 i'm okay feeling stupid all the time as
17:55 long as you know there is a flowing
17:57 discussion and we think about the
17:59 problem together right like because they
18:01 would when i do this the stupid question
18:04 then
18:06 the the team will explain me no you are
18:08 wrong because this is is no it's not bad
18:11 this is right
18:13 then you learn about projects more i i
18:15 learn
18:16 and
18:17 and based on that they can
18:19 they can think of an alternative
18:21 solution and also because i study with
18:22 the wrong assumptions sometimes
18:24 i
18:25 i bring a solution out of the box right
18:27 like because i
18:29 i
18:30 i think something in a different
18:31 structure and that triggers you know the
18:34 they you know they love the tiny lab
18:36 idea of ah that if if this were
18:39 different this would work so what you
18:41 need to to take it to that role
18:44 i know yeah
18:46 like it's it's more like that again i'm
18:48 not i'm not trying to be stupid in front
18:50 of the people you report right i
18:53 something i always say is like
18:55 data science is an area that everybody
18:57 specializes so much right everybody
19:00 works in such specific domains many
19:02 times
19:03 that
19:04 like it will be superior to to say that
19:08 you know everything you're working with
19:12 right like i think that anybody who is a
19:14 specialist data scientist knows that
19:17 you're a specialist because
19:20 not because you know all data scientists
19:21 because you're able to learn new things
19:23 and adapt
19:25 but there is no way you know everything
19:27 right like
19:28 so making a measure actually that
19:31 gives even less
19:32 less knowledge right because now part of
19:34 your time is it's not on the technical
19:37 aspects it's also parties in
19:39 the people and the processes
19:42 you have you have to pay attention to
19:43 all the areas
19:46 so did i understand correctly so i know
19:47 that you
19:48 before becoming a manager you very
19:50 senior data scientist in the relevance
19:52 team so you were dealing with
19:54 recommendations mostly okay
19:56 yes i was working yes mostly everything
20:00 around let's say search and
20:02 recommendations sorting around
20:05 uh you know from the moment the user at
20:07 their legs for for who doesn't know it's
20:09 an online classified
20:11 people come to buy a cell
20:13 when they come to buy
20:15 they have more or less three ways to
20:17 find things a few more but let's talk
20:18 about the main ones one is navigational
20:21 but they go through the categories right
20:23 and they start applying filters
20:26 and the other one is through the search
20:29 wire okay where where
20:31 is where it's one of the areas where we
20:33 do the most applications around search
20:36 and the other one is through
20:37 recommendations right being on the on
20:39 the
20:40 homepage the home fit right like when
20:41 when they narrate or being in there more
20:43 like this okay
20:45 or even when you reach out the end of
20:47 the end of the results for search what
20:50 we recommend you to keep up following
20:52 right uh searching
20:54 uh so this is more or less there yes i i
20:57 was strongly let's say experienced right
21:00 around this area at least for for the
21:02 last few years yeah then you got
21:05 somebody the people you you needed to
21:07 manage you're working on advertisement
21:10 projects right
21:12 yes very specific
21:14 like it was about uh real time beating
21:16 red
21:18 and uh these things kind of like it's
21:20 actually it's actually
21:22 like i like that actually confused me a
21:24 lot because they i didn't know this team
21:27 beforehand right like or at least not in
21:28 detail uh
21:31 like that was the first thing i was
21:33 that i was aha right because i assume it
21:35 was
21:36 the theme that we were using to
21:39 do all publicity for lx right to send
21:41 traffic to alexa no it actually was a
21:44 team
21:45 of the things that were
21:47 uh
21:48 like the spaces we sold at the lx for
21:51 third-party people advertising at our
21:53 platform right like how to optimize
21:56 the different areas you know the real
21:58 estate
21:59 we have at our site okay and sell that
22:02 so how to how to use what's called yield
22:04 management right how to
22:06 personalize how to
22:09 a better
22:10 better let's say performance of the of
22:13 the
22:14 campaigns that are sold at royal ex
22:17 so that was ah okay and that was
22:20 really super new for me and had to start
22:22 living a lot
22:24 um so you basically
22:26 knew nothing about this domain right
22:30 no no not at all not at all not at all i
22:32 was like on a parachute we said in
22:35 spanish when i was with a parachute
22:36 landing you know and
22:38 improvising uh like if if paul and peter
22:41 are listening apologies okay i know i
22:44 know it was hard with me
22:46 uh i hope i have you know
22:49 a a good job
22:52 um so
22:55 so it was quite difficult for you to get
22:57 so now not only you needed to learn
22:59 anything but also you needed to manage
23:01 people who are doing things that you
23:05 don't know much about right
23:09 yes yes and
23:11 and and
23:14 and then it becomes a little bit of you
23:16 know
23:19 extrapolating the learnings you have as
23:22 a data scientist to other areas because
23:24 there are some things
23:25 which are different which is maybe the
23:27 domain
23:28 uh
23:30 and maybe some of the models not all of
23:32 them but some of the models right
23:34 um but there are things that don't
23:37 change okay
23:38 uh
23:40 structuring a machine learning project
23:41 right uh making sure that
23:44 uh
23:45 you are let's say how to correctly
23:46 define the problem statement what type
23:49 of
23:50 problem you have at hand right
23:52 like even with a basic as if it's a
23:54 regression or classification but even
23:56 later things like
23:58 uh
23:59 like or supervisor supervised right but
24:02 even later like even inside those
24:04 categories right what type of drawing
24:06 you're solving and what are the caveats
24:09 right because not everything falls into
24:11 boxes automatically right like like wait
24:14 even even if you want to say right oh
24:16 this is
24:17 such and such problem sometimes you can
24:20 change the lens and steal words right
24:22 and so this this part is still the same
24:25 then
24:26 future engineering also stays
24:29 there right
24:31 maybe a few new techniques here and
24:32 there right
24:36 and also the the whole evaluation and
24:38 connecting to kpis right like the
24:40 monitoring the
24:42 the
24:43 you know the
24:44 and the and the alerting etcetera like
24:47 there are many things which are common
24:49 to any data science project
24:51 uh
24:52 and also how to drive the hypothesis
24:55 right like when you
24:57 when you are dealing with a problem and
24:59 you're stuck and you need to improve
25:01 right
25:03 which hypothesis to rise and what how to
25:05 answer them what things to check
25:09 and how to prioritize work based on for
25:11 example impact and how to drive analysis
25:14 in order to decide what to test next
25:18 uh those things let's say that that
25:21 exercise
25:23 stays similar across brushes right like
25:27 you
25:28 [Music]
25:29 you tend to
25:31 they of course they're coming up with
25:33 the ideas and the questions it's always
25:35 super hard right like i'm not saying
25:37 it's easy but i'm saying
25:38 that
25:39 the way of you know the process of
25:43 which stage to what right
25:45 uh
25:46 that helps right so so i always guide
25:49 the people like on this direction
25:52 that i usually help a lot try to help
25:54 them so you were coaching mentoring more
25:57 in this like how to structure project
25:59 how to approach this uh like how do we
26:01 actually form the problem we have in
26:03 terms of machine in machine learning
26:05 terms and then measuring and all that so
26:08 more like with structuring your approach
26:10 and then you you're leaving the domain
26:12 knowledge and actually actual modeling
26:14 to
26:16 yes or or even for example when let's
26:19 say like
26:20 like let's say we have
26:22 a you know
26:25 we have let's say that the end
26:26 performance is not good enough right so
26:28 then
26:29 then first figuring out is it's
26:32 uh asking the right question right this
26:34 you know another fitting problem not
26:36 enough data
26:37 model not strong enough right
26:39 uh
26:40 like a difference between you know uh
26:43 test sets and production data like all
26:47 these questions first i helped with this
26:49 fine grade and then once we are in this
26:51 you know we identify the plan right like
26:53 now now let's say we are
26:55 uh let's say
26:57 uh
26:58 i know overfitting right then then then
27:01 i help with all the the ideas around you
27:04 know overfitting like all the tools you
27:05 have at hand okay
27:07 to to fight over fitting depending on
27:09 the model of course you know with under
27:11 something over sampling uh
27:13 regularization etc
27:15 what
27:15 how of even future engineering sometimes
27:18 you know like or getting more features
27:20 things like that they always help
27:22 or if it's you know not the model is not
27:24 strong enough or the let's say the model
27:27 is not learning right okay what makes
27:29 the data can we think of thinking about
27:31 the domain right trying to think
27:33 sometimes it's better not to think
27:36 from the
27:37 from the model point of view but think
27:39 okay if i'm not person right that needs
27:41 to
27:42 decide whatever because i always say
27:44 machine learning is automatic decision
27:46 systems right like you can always say
27:48 it's at least the way we apply right
27:50 data products automatic decision systems
27:52 not saying i wouldn't put it on a book
27:54 okay listen like i'm saying like it's an
27:56 oversimplification
27:58 but i mean it's
27:59 if that machine has to take a decision
28:04 and what extra data can you provide
28:07 private extra piece of information can
28:08 you provide to help on that decision
28:10 okay and for that you need to think a
28:13 little bit like okay if i were to see if
28:15 i if i was lying i didn't know yes right
28:18 and i were to ask
28:20 you know information about something to
28:22 to make a decision what extra
28:24 information will i look for
28:26 to take that decision right and and then
28:28 we can think about the domain right how
28:30 to model that how to how to
28:33 get it
28:34 because that's always super hard right
28:36 the data
28:38 and yes i'm searching and then the other
28:41 part i help a lot is navigate in the
28:43 organization like that's the part that
28:45 is not so much data science but
28:48 it's more
28:49 you know
28:50 cultural soft skill maybe or people
28:53 skill like that is
28:55 okay so you're you're working on this
28:57 problem
28:59 and you need
29:00 this amount of data or integrates to
29:02 this system or
29:04 or figure out how this part of the
29:06 system works
29:08 so
29:09 making the connections right like making
29:11 the conversations happen because
29:14 like even though we like to think that
29:16 in a real world things are not always
29:18 super like perfectly documented or
29:20 perfectly clear how things work in a
29:22 company like as big as this one like
29:25 sometimes it's challenging right
29:28 um
29:29 i think one thing you didn't mention is
29:31 that you
29:32 also help a lot from what i see
29:34 is connecting uh product people from
29:37 product management with data science and
29:39 helping translate
29:41 be a translator between
29:43 between the
29:45 product managers and data scientists
29:47 that's something that is quite important
29:49 i think because sometimes data
29:50 scientists
29:53 i remember myself we tend to work on
29:55 things that uh do not necessarily make
29:57 user impact they're just fun to work on
29:59 right and then
30:01 but yeah project managers come with some
30:03 ideas and then how do you connect these
30:05 things
30:06 yes
30:07 like maybe maybe i forgot to mention
30:09 that some like if i can put something on
30:13 what
30:14 if i can choose one thing like the key
30:16 to
30:17 let's say to
30:18 let's call it success i don't know like
30:20 you can't think if it's success or not
30:21 right we can call it success like the
30:23 key to our success services
30:25 this obsession with product applications
30:27 like
30:28 making sure that the data science
30:31 solution is
30:33 let's say impacting the the final use
30:36 right that uh
30:37 that is helping someone right that
30:41 that somebody gets a benefit out of your
30:44 work
30:44 uh and not just yourself or
30:47 not just yourself for doing that
30:50 somebody will receive this
30:52 cool thing almost magical right that is
30:54 data science
30:56 and
30:57 and have a you know
30:59 and solve one of their problems you know
31:01 that otherwise it would be a
31:04 much more complex right like i think we
31:06 all leave it on every day right
31:09 when you see something oh how did i
31:11 don't know whatever
31:12 google like uh
31:14 i find all the pictures of my cat right
31:17 and i couldn't do that even if i wanted
31:20 right like you go through all my
31:21 pictures of other pictures like that and
31:22 that changes your life because now you
31:25 can see a collection of
31:26 even better like all the pictures of my
31:28 mom right and i can see them all
31:31 together that's so nice i like to see
31:34 like so many memories
31:36 well
31:37 i want to achieve the same on people
31:39 right i want to create this these
31:40 moments of ah
31:42 like this is like my life changed
31:44 because of this you know
31:48 like sometimes not so direct and not so
31:50 joyful like or not
31:53 more mundane let's call it more and more
31:55 every day okay because i i'm more
31:57 realistic
31:59 but
32:00 yes i find it i find it that that that
32:03 drive and then then
32:05 something i put a lot of my mind is
32:09 what are the steps right how do you get
32:11 from
32:12 this
32:13 uh let's say
32:15 uh
32:17 a static data set and a model and
32:19 optimizing on a
32:20 on rock out you know but only way
32:24 that that's
32:25 work you spend right
32:27 impacts
32:30 that bridge right because there is a
32:32 huge gap like you have a model right you
32:34 have the pickle file or you have the
32:36 you know the tensorflow and then what do
32:39 you do with it right like you cannot
32:41 give it to the user right
32:44 you cannot give it a picture file and
32:46 expect them to
32:48 to enjoy it
32:49 um
32:50 so
32:51 so yes how to connect it to
32:55 the normal iterations of a product
32:57 company right like
32:59 uh like experiment
33:01 with
33:02 like i think it's one of the key let's
33:05 say
33:06 words here like
33:07 go and test your things quickly
33:10 start with a very simple thing
33:13 if i can't recommend
33:14 one reading today it would be
33:17 for me it's very inspirational the
33:19 rules of ml okay i think it's something
33:22 google shares a lot and do you remember
33:24 the first rule of machine learning
33:27 uh yeah i think it's uh don't don't
33:29 hesitate to try a rule right yeah i
33:32 think it's like don't use machine
33:34 learning or start without machine
33:36 learning i think that's yes yes yes and
33:39 and i get tired of repeating that
33:41 of course you know especially with more
33:43 with with more junior people that you
33:46 know become very ambitious i see myself
33:49 there right i was also there and it's
33:51 the same way if you
33:52 go to university and they tell you no
33:54 the first year you're not going to do
33:55 programming right but i came to study
33:57 abroad no that first year you would be
33:59 you know
34:00 doing math and you say i want to program
34:03 they're saying here right like sometimes
34:05 the project when it starts
34:07 uh
34:09 it doesn't need the model
34:11 she needs everything around it right it
34:12 needs the
34:14 getting the data
34:16 an evaluation a good evaluation metric a
34:18 system to connect it to the user
34:21 a way to
34:22 to to experiment or maybe uh try it
34:25 right
34:26 as a simple
34:28 a very simple and maybe uh
34:30 you know poor pipeline right but
34:32 something that you can run a few times
34:34 right and regenerate things
34:36 maybe not productionalize but something
34:38 that you can't reuse right
34:41 and
34:42 because you want to fail fast
34:44 you don't want to spend that risk is too
34:46 high right like if you say it no in six
34:49 six months and we all think no it's like
34:52 we'll think on a promotion learning
34:54 project and you say
34:55 uh
34:56 product manager ask you how long it's
34:58 going to take you and you think to
34:59 yourself i'm going to have a very good
35:01 solution it will take me two months
35:03 no way like now it takes two months to
35:05 finish something if you are going to
35:06 work two months it's going to be six
35:08 because you will just spend the first
35:10 two and then getting the data modeling
35:12 and and making a very small demo
35:15 so it's better to
35:17 start with the simplest model you can do
35:20 and connect it to the user in the first
35:22 two months
35:23 if you receive in a drop that's okay and
35:26 now you know you can measure that drop
35:28 and that is if you put once you have a
35:30 better model down the line right that
35:32 can beat that baseline
35:34 uh
35:35 you will be able to measure right and
35:36 then from modeling to testing in
35:39 production won't take you no time and
35:41 you
35:41 you
35:42 your code you you know you you work on
35:45 you're not full you test your value
35:46 right it's a green light okay green
35:48 light to test and you go to test in
35:50 production
35:51 and and you can decide then if you want
35:54 to move forward or not right and then
35:55 you you have this
35:57 incremental
35:59 incremental gains right like
36:01 i haven't read many
36:03 books around a child and data science
36:06 but maybe you have one to recommend if
36:08 you had to recommend one alexa what
36:10 would it be
36:11 no i don't know i like chris bm but
36:13 there is no bookcase yeah
36:15 but
36:16 just an article in
36:18 wikipedia i think there is a book but
36:21 i think i like this process it's a very
36:23 old process it's like 20 years old or
36:25 something like this okay
36:27 surprisingly it's still valid today
36:29 yeah
36:31 all these things
36:32 like business understanding and data
36:34 understanding and then data processing
36:36 or data preparation i think it's called
36:38 then modeling then evaluation and
36:39 deployment i think it's still valid
36:41 today even though i don't know where
36:43 they deployed
36:44 ibm folks 20 years ago what they used
36:47 for that yeah they they i at that point
36:50 there was already shara so the concept
36:52 of deploying mastery
36:55 yeah that's that's interesting yes
36:57 i i i i
36:59 if something like like once of course
37:01 once once you you get through
37:04 let's say that the technical challenges
37:06 of doing data science
37:08 uh let's say that you know how to code
37:10 you know how to model you you understand
37:12 how to evaluate you know
37:14 you know you cover at least all the
37:15 basics right there is always time to
37:17 learn you know the complex very complex
37:19 modeling stuff right
37:20 but whoever is doing data scientists
37:23 will tell you the mod in our company the
37:24 modeling part
37:26 is
37:27 no more than five to ten percent of your
37:30 time right like uh
37:32 uh
37:35 like of course i'm talking about a year
37:37 average right and maybe there is one
37:40 full month you are modeling but
37:42 in inside but in overall like you will
37:44 be a lot of doing
37:46 understanding the problem getting the
37:48 data connecting it to production okay
37:50 that's the most time demanding
37:53 for me once you get through this
37:55 technical challenge for me the next
37:58 thing is learning this like uh
38:00 like because it it takes you have some
38:03 little time to do the modeling part okay
38:07 uh
38:08 that
38:11 you have so little that you better spend
38:14 it on the things that are going to be
38:15 impactful you have limited time to work
38:18 on the on the model and the part you
38:20 enjoy so
38:21 so
38:22 there are so many things to try right we
38:24 know it's a very dense you know like
38:26 it's a very deep area right like uh like
38:28 there are so many things to try and to
38:30 experiment so
38:33 prioritizing the right thing to do at
38:35 each point in time for me is is what
38:38 differentiates let's say
38:40 the good from the bad data scientists
38:42 because
38:43 like there are many data scientists that
38:45 will know how to
38:47 let's say how to do each of the possible
38:50 things you can do you know they know how
38:51 to model they know how they know all the
38:52 possible layers they know all deposit
38:54 techniques for cross-validation hyper
38:57 parameter tuning they they know like end
39:00 to end all the modeling part right they
39:03 they have no problem
39:04 but then they struggle a lot to decide
39:06 what to do right which of all these
39:08 things i should be prioritizing at some
39:10 point in time
39:12 for me here it comes like connecting it
39:14 to the to the product right
39:16 like you start with the product and what
39:18 you have
39:19 then you do the experiment you see what
39:21 you saw in the experience right and then
39:23 you translate that you know you have
39:24 appropriations
39:26 you you you bring it back
39:30 all the way to
39:32 you know
39:33 all the way to to
39:34 at which stage you know we will have the
39:37 most impact on that problem and you
39:39 apply
39:40 it don't know i i
39:44 yeah that's that's great and as a
39:45 manager you help
39:47 people with this process to help them
39:50 you know help them stay focused on that
39:52 connecting it with real problem and then
39:55 sometimes i remember i was also in one
39:57 of these projects where you would say
39:58 okay hey enough let's uh focus on
40:01 actually
40:02 you know integrating it with the product
40:05 and then
40:06 making sure that this is getting
40:08 consumed and then iterating on that i
40:10 think this is quite important that
40:12 somebody tells you and then you think
40:13 okay yeah that's correct i should uh i
40:15 should try to wrap up and uh
40:18 start iterating
40:20 that's one of the things you're doing
40:21 right
40:23 um
40:24 you were talking about this 30-60-90
40:27 uh
40:29 so you said in the first like the first
40:31 month
40:32 you would and when you were talking
40:34 about your
40:36 process of transitioning from individual
40:38 contributor to a manager
40:40 so you said that in the first month you
40:42 wanted to meet the team right so you me
40:45 you were meeting the entire team you
40:47 were doing a bit of reading then in the
40:48 next month so this is the 60 part
40:51 midterm so you were trying to get on
40:53 board and understand all the projects
40:56 that the team was working on and also
40:59 learn a bit about the domains domain of
41:01 these projects
41:03 and i wanted to ask you what was in the
41:06 this on the third month in the 90th part
41:09 okay i i what you're telling it is you
41:12 know i went and opened the fight like
41:14 like because i couldn't remember but
41:16 here it is like uh
41:19 on the tail mat i did feedback
41:21 okay like uh because there was no point
41:24 for me giving any type of feedback
41:27 until spending at least one quarter
41:29 right at least one round
41:31 i didn't give like lots of feedback
41:35 at that point that's a not critical one
41:37 like i think everybody was let's say
41:40 working fine at that point but
41:44 i
41:45 i took the time to you know to
41:48 to
41:49 give back what i think it was my opinion
41:51 but i
41:52 i delayed that until the very last okay
41:55 because i wanted to make sure
41:57 that i have a full view of the situation
41:59 before giving any type of feedback
42:00 because i
42:03 i i i saw myself the other way right
42:06 sometimes you do like all of us have had
42:08 managers right
42:10 uh
42:11 all the time i'm comparing okay what i
42:12 would like and i will dislike right
42:15 i put a little bit of my personal touch
42:17 right like i treat people the way i
42:19 would like to be treated uh
42:22 because
42:23 you know it feels okay like it feels
42:26 uh
42:28 fair right uh
42:31 or even better of course like better
42:33 than i would treat so i would like
42:34 somebody to treat me all right
42:36 and
42:37 i don't like somebody coming in the
42:39 first two months and tell me that i'm
42:41 doing things wrong right with
42:43 like like not because i'm not doing them
42:46 right but you know it it relationality
42:48 is distracted somebody
42:50 is
42:52 touching you will be
42:53 by the cover right because
42:56 you want to spend some more time
42:58 maybe even 60 days maybe
43:01 60 or 70 days
43:02 are not enough okay
43:05 but uh
43:07 but already i felt like after one
43:09 quarter of working
43:11 on projects and being able to do
43:13 iterations on
43:14 uh working with okrs and seeing how how
43:17 the team performs let's say
43:19 on
43:20 how they were structuring the projects
43:21 at that time
43:24 made sense to to really give some hints
43:27 and start working on that okay
43:30 so it was feedback right in the last so
43:33 you were giving feedback to yes
43:35 yes
43:36 even if it was not bad okay but given
43:38 already my opinion let's say on on
43:41 on what i saw so far like uh
43:44 because i i put uh yeah
43:46 how do you give feedback because this is
43:49 not something you
43:50 know how to do as a senior data
43:52 scientist well sometimes you do but this
43:55 is not the let's say main responsibility
43:57 but as a manager this kind of becomes
44:00 your main responsibility right so how do
44:02 you approach giving feedback in such a
44:04 way that
44:06 people can receive it and not be
44:10 let's say against and become defensive
44:13 because this sometimes uh yeah this is
44:16 challenge right it's challenging yeah
44:18 well first depends on the feedback
44:20 on
44:21 like
44:22 um
44:23 like
44:24 like maybe for people hearing like
44:26 depends on how you are how the other
44:28 person is and what the feedback is right
44:30 the three parts of the communication but
44:34 i i had good mentors and one one of them
44:37 i can't remember who but one of them
44:39 told me that
44:40 like especially when you're going to
44:42 live i feel like that you feel
44:43 uncomfortable giving right
44:46 the first things first thing you ask is
44:49 to the person is if they are interested
44:51 in receiving feedback
44:52 okay because like that's that's first
44:55 thing right you have to start the
44:56 conversation
44:58 with
44:59 hey like uh like are you interested in
45:01 receiving feedback yes no some people
45:04 don't don't like it just don't like it
45:06 or don't trust your
45:08 thing especially the very beginning
45:10 right later on you build that trust okay
45:13 but the bigger beginning maybe
45:16 you have to ask second is
45:19 on maybe second enough first
45:22 is caring you know about that person
45:24 like but you keep that fecal you're
45:26 giving that figure because you care
45:28 about them because you think
45:30 it will make them better okay or that it
45:33 will help them
45:34 um
45:36 and
45:38 and that already puts you in a position
45:40 where
45:41 where
45:42 where you don't feel around you never
45:43 give a feel like this is what you should
45:46 you have to do right except very clear
45:49 things you know somebody is
45:52 behaving a very unacceptable behavior
45:55 but that happens you know i think in my
45:58 in more than three years i think i saw
46:00 it just once you know
46:02 and you don't know how you're going to
46:03 think you just come up when i want to
46:05 say don't do that okay like like
46:07 that's that's the easiest feedback to
46:09 give right when somebody does something
46:11 that is unacceptable for a professional
46:13 man
46:14 but then
46:15 for
46:17 giving tips or feedback or things that
46:19 you think are harming that person
46:21 progress okay
46:23 uh
46:24 you should start saying that it's
46:27 that it's an advice
46:29 that is something
46:31 you feel it could help them
46:33 that you may be wrong okay like that
46:36 you're a manager and you're getting
46:38 feedback doesn't make you right okay
46:40 like and and when you start like that
46:43 like like you you say i mean at least at
46:46 least for me
46:48 i've i say it because i feel like that i
46:50 feel like i give them my opinion on what
46:53 i think okay
46:57 of course it
46:58 it's it's uh
47:00 i won't lie to you that the
47:03 opinion of your manager also impacts
47:04 your your professional career it's
47:07 impossible to deny it okay like that
47:10 it's it's how things grow unfortunately
47:13 but um
47:14 [Music]
47:16 let's say the the
47:18 the end of the line is that like that
47:20 you do it from the point that you care
47:23 that you open the possibility right that
47:25 uh
47:26 that you may be wrong with the feedback
47:27 okay but
47:30 and that you give them the space to to
47:32 think about it and to see if they
47:34 reflect on that if they think the same
47:36 and if you think it will help them okay
47:39 um
47:40 [Music]
47:42 maybe too generic we can maybe do an
47:44 exercise and give it with a concrete
47:45 sample i know if it's the objective of
47:47 today but
47:48 uh
47:50 yeah but basically like it boils down to
47:52 caring about the person and then uh
47:55 when you're not
47:56 close uh
47:58 like maybe in the first month you ask
47:59 first
48:00 and then
48:02 i guess the rest is uh just happens
48:04 naturally right
48:06 okay yeah having feedback often also
48:08 helps like
48:10 having regular one once right
48:13 yes yes like uh one-on-ones like for me
48:15 as a manager that should happen at least
48:18 once a week
48:19 except that of course like
48:22 with a very senior person maybe 30
48:24 minutes or 15 minutes catch up
48:26 uh once a week that's fine but
48:30 don't don't feel comp like you you will
48:33 feel compelled like if there is no
48:34 topics to skip it but there is always
48:37 something to talk even at least to say
48:39 like you know even more with remote
48:40 setup right even at least you say hi and
48:43 see how the person is doing
48:47 people go you know through personal
48:50 matters all the time or or you know like
48:52 you're you're trapped in everyday work
48:55 right to the problems and
48:56 what is bigger right
48:59 i
49:00 i always have this i don't know
49:02 philosophy they say the same one as i
49:04 told you that i treat people you know
49:06 better like the same or better the other
49:09 one i have is
49:11 people spend a huge percentage of their
49:13 conscious life at work okay
49:16 so it has to be
49:18 not just a nice place it has to be a
49:20 place of growth you know it has to be a
49:22 place of
49:24 uh
49:25 you know it's a it's
49:27 it's a place where what you're doing
49:29 like that in some in some way it feels
49:31 like a game right like like not a game
49:33 it's not a game but i mean
49:35 like supposedly where you can make
49:36 mistakes and they are not so
49:39 harmful okay like when in real life the
49:42 mistakes are much more like real life
49:44 everything is your life i mean like your
49:45 personal life making mistakes is much
49:48 more hard right
49:49 while at work like
49:51 like
49:52 you can always change your work or
49:55 change theme or or or
49:57 or start from scratch and change the
49:59 project you know making mistakes this is
50:01 a at work it's a safe place to do it and
50:04 it should be like
50:06 and learning from those mistakes i feel
50:08 it's a place to learn a lot
50:10 not just about your profession and also
50:13 life right like how to
50:15 relate to other people i don't know i i
50:17 i have that as
50:19 [Music]
50:21 that's that's nice i noticed that uh
50:23 last time i checked questions there were
50:25 none but now i check there are four so
50:27 better
50:28 two questions so the first question is
50:30 what's the hardest thing you have
50:33 you need to deal with as a manager
50:38 i think
50:42 i'm thinking okay i think there was more
50:44 than one but maybe i can
50:47 you can give yes i can tell you yes i
50:49 can tell you
50:54 losing losing someone in the team that
50:57 uh
50:58 you know that was
51:00 very close to the team i was you know
51:02 like that like it's like sometimes there
51:04 are people that that come to
51:06 the team or maybe they'll completely you
51:08 know involve or not but when you
51:11 sometimes when sponsoring somebody
51:14 is they are very good they bring that
51:17 spirit they they
51:19 they work you know
51:22 to make they not just themselves but
51:25 everybody around them have a better time
51:27 uh
51:28 seeing them live is super painful like
51:31 now you never get used to that
51:34 okay how do you deal with this just
51:36 accept that people move on right
51:38 is there any other way
51:43 you
51:44 first is why because you the same as
51:47 when you give feedback like you you wish
51:49 them the best okay you you
51:52 you think they are
51:53 let's say
51:54 if they choose that is because they
51:56 think it's the best for them so you
51:58 support right like i think
52:04 supporting that person on their live
52:07 choices like this
52:09 is what a manager should do right yeah
52:12 sorry i got emotional
52:14 like who would ask that question
52:22 that's one of the hardest ones for me
52:27 yeah i understand thanks for sharing
52:30 yeah
52:31 uh do you have time to do technical work
52:33 as a manager or not at all
52:36 well it depends on how depends a lot um
52:40 like a straight answer uh mostly not
52:43 like you shouldn't be on the critical
52:45 path of any project like
52:47 no project should depend on your work
52:49 otherwise you will
52:51 you will be like your role as a manager
52:54 is unblocking let's say making a
52:56 facilitate and making sure that
52:59 let's say that every project is on time
53:02 and
53:03 people can work easily so if you say no
53:06 i will work on the most important class
53:08 of the project step aside wait for me
53:11 you will have something pop up because
53:13 you have some manager there is always
53:14 something pop-up that is urgent so you
53:17 cannot work on that so
53:19 but you can do still a lot of things you
53:21 can
53:23 if you you can do prototypes you can
53:27 do you know participate in a merge
53:29 request do review a lot of code i read a
53:32 lot of code right i spend a lot of time
53:35 reading i try to it's like instead of
53:38 reading twitter i read code every
53:39 morning right like i i spend a i
53:43 that's what's something i also enjoy a
53:45 lot like like
53:47 maybe humility apart without humbleness
53:50 right i can say that
53:52 i i can i can read code and i can read
53:54 code fast right i can i like navigating
53:56 lots of code
53:58 so whenever someone is called in my team
54:00 are coding or some other team is coding
54:02 i will
54:03 champion and and read a lot of code
54:06 until suggestions i mentioned libraries
54:09 of course not as a bloke right you
54:10 should i try to remember
54:12 writer
54:14 or things like that unfortunate people i
54:16 of course i will i will
54:18 mention the things i think they should
54:19 be improving right things that i feel
54:21 like
54:22 they could not not that i want to see
54:25 that i think they will benefit because
54:27 if you have code for some time
54:30 uh you know that you hate your code in
54:33 six months okay so so i just keep tips
54:35 so they hate it less
54:37 in six months you know from that point
54:40 in time right
54:41 like i try to help on that area
54:44 so mostly spend time reading code giving
54:47 feedback on code then sometimes
54:49 prototypes but mostly right do you
54:52 are you also involved in um like
54:55 architectural discussions and uh
54:57 yes yes yes
54:59 i the thing is for example now in my
55:01 team i have some
55:04 some machine learning machines which are
55:05 quite similar so like i
55:08 they are very good okay so so i'm
55:10 relying more and more for example like
55:13 they they do quite a big chunk of that
55:15 right but at the beginning yes i was
55:17 working very very close to that area i
55:20 still do right but nowadays there is
55:22 more people that that can solve it you
55:25 know on their own and they do very good
55:27 solutions right but even better
55:29 like an even better
55:31 way better
55:33 whatever i can i can say
55:35 so
55:36 so yes
55:38 okay yeah thanks
55:39 and uh another question we have is uh
55:41 how do you suggest the managers should
55:44 deal with pet hires
55:46 oh that's a tricky one okay that's
55:49 particular
55:50 um
55:52 yes uh it's always a dilemma like uh
55:56 like
55:58 like
56:00 like of course like i will say something
56:02 uh
56:03 that the the quality of the question
56:05 will hate me the first thing to do with
56:08 about hire is to have very good
56:10 interviews okay
56:12 like it's better to take longer to hire
56:14 somebody but to be super sure that that
56:18 person will do you know like even at the
56:21 expense of having longer processes of
56:23 interviewing processes and
56:25 losing candidates because you know
56:27 they're accepting other offers somewhere
56:28 else and you took longer
56:30 than to win the situation because you
56:32 lose more time
56:33 like you lose more time hiring somebody
56:36 on boarding and then realizing they are
56:37 not working then
56:39 spending maybe having to interview the
56:42 total amount of people okay
56:44 uh
56:46 the
56:48 then once you have it there right let's
56:50 say the situation already happened
56:52 uh
56:53 depends what's the notice period in each
56:55 country okay so every country has
56:58 different notice period
56:59 but
57:01 uh
57:03 let's say
57:04 uh if it's like germany that is six
57:06 months notice period which is huge
57:08 period right yes what did i say
57:12 yes probation period yes
57:15 if you
57:18 are such a long probation period then at
57:21 the three months you can already do a
57:24 uh you know uh evaluation right
57:27 and
57:28 uh
57:29 at that point in time you can what you
57:31 can do
57:32 uh
57:34 is uh
57:35 if you think it's not working right or
57:37 if you also if you think it's working
57:39 right but yeah if you think it's not
57:41 working you'll fit okay you say
57:44 i think it's not working because this
57:45 this this
57:46 i think you're not on time or whatever
57:48 your call is not good enough or it's not
57:50 working right
57:52 and for the people that is performing
57:54 well you also give them hey you're doing
57:55 fine like because people are very
57:57 stressed on the probation period so it's
57:59 good to give them reassurance
58:01 if you think they're doing fine because
58:03 you know
58:04 there is no point in people feeling
58:07 without confidence
58:08 uh
58:09 if they're doing fine
58:11 um so
58:13 if it's a shorter period then
58:16 make sure to do some some evaluation
58:18 like one month before okay
58:21 and give not just the feedback but also
58:23 what we call at our company all the
58:25 companies have similar things uh
58:28 uh
58:29 you know a development plan right like
58:31 these are the things we think you're not
58:33 doing well
58:35 as a manager
58:36 saying
58:37 i
58:38 you can improve them by doing this you
58:41 know like start having some suggestions
58:42 not that they have to because everybody
58:45 learns in a different way okay some
58:46 people prefer courses some people prefer
58:48 hands-on some people prefer
58:51 uh
58:51 you know
58:52 a mix or being mentored right somebody
58:55 teaching them
58:56 but but at least but it's not just
58:59 saying what's not working also giving
59:00 them
59:01 some possible path okay
59:04 for them also to figure out you can
59:06 think it together right how to how to
59:08 improve on those things
59:10 and
59:11 well and if you buy preparation period
59:13 this is
59:14 no signs of improvement right because if
59:17 there is signs and you're willing to
59:18 wait then the person can keep improving
59:21 okay
59:22 uh but if there is no signs of
59:24 improvement then like well you have to
59:26 stop the relationship unfortunately like
59:28 it's it's best for for both okay like
59:32 and
59:33 it's not only good for the company it's
59:35 also good for the play because otherwise
59:37 they will stay in a situation where they
59:39 are always underperforming
59:41 and people will
59:43 they they end up with a stigma right
59:45 that they're always
59:46 with the stigma of being the one that
59:48 doesn't perform they they cannot grow in
59:50 the company much easily later on because
59:52 they there was a stigma that you you
59:55 started you know super bad right
59:58 and
1:00:00 so yes
1:00:01 then if it's after the operation period
1:00:05 oh that's even trickier right i and
1:00:08 takes longer of course i always like
1:00:10 it's very important to give people the
1:00:11 opportunity to give this development
1:00:13 plan
1:00:15 and make you know and work with them
1:00:17 spend some time it it's the kind of
1:00:19 situation i created amongst the most
1:00:20 amount of work
1:00:22 uh
1:00:24 for the in comparison to the results
1:00:26 obviously right but it's correctly fine
1:00:29 in the end like when people like when
1:00:31 people like react to that and start
1:00:33 working it's it's quite gratifying like
1:00:35 actually
1:00:36 it's it's
1:00:37 it's good
1:00:39 situation like not everybody is already
1:00:41 thai super performing like it will
1:00:43 happen at some point of your career
1:00:46 that
1:00:47 you are under right expectations
1:00:50 uh so it's good to have a heads up on
1:00:52 somebody to to hold your hand for a bit
1:00:55 to indicate you the path i think that's
1:00:57 good to have a manager doing that right
1:01:00 yeah it's nice to have manager like you
1:01:05 you have to by the way you have to ask
1:01:07 my team not me if i'm doing the right
1:01:09 word right like okay yeah right exactly
1:01:11 maybe for the next interview i'll invite
1:01:13 somebody from yes like i couldn't be
1:01:16 saying anything
1:01:19 do you have time for one more question
1:01:21 sure sure i'm all yours yes yeah so how
1:01:24 do you keep up uh with the latest
1:01:26 advancement in the areas uh
1:01:29 like you you need to guide the team
1:01:31 right uh so how do you keep up to
1:01:34 with the developments to be able to
1:01:36 guide the team yes yes
1:01:39 good one um
1:01:41 well
1:01:43 that is not i i i received this question
1:01:46 in the past uh for me there is no recipe
1:01:49 okay
1:01:51 something i have very let's say very
1:01:53 internalized because i learned it the
1:01:55 hard way
1:01:56 uh except that you're working at the
1:01:59 the big ones you know the microsoft
1:02:02 google
1:02:03 facebook apples of the world right like
1:02:06 or all you're working on something very
1:02:07 niche or very very ai specific okay like
1:02:11 a ai centric company a company that does
1:02:13 ai
1:02:14 uh
1:02:16 i don't try things that have not been
1:02:18 proven before okay in the sense of no
1:02:21 it's not that it has to be one to one
1:02:24 something something that somebody did
1:02:25 before but
1:02:26 i usually try to
1:02:29 to try things that
1:02:31 uh
1:02:32 let's say a set of the conditions don't
1:02:34 allow it right but i usually try to
1:02:36 think
1:02:38 like trying things that
1:02:40 some other company in a similar domain
1:02:42 have tried in the past okay
1:02:45 so then what something i'd really like
1:02:47 to follow very closely is
1:02:49 what other companies are doing
1:02:52 okay with their in their data science
1:02:54 team what's working for them what's not
1:02:56 working for them
1:02:57 and whenever they see that they're using
1:02:59 something new right that they were not
1:03:00 using before
1:03:02 uh that i'm not aware i want to study i
1:03:05 also am particularly interested in nlp
1:03:07 right nlp is the area i started so i
1:03:10 really like it so whenever there is
1:03:11 something new you know it was elmo at
1:03:14 the time now birds and you know the
1:03:16 transformers earlier it's nowadays
1:03:19 the thing and all the pre-training
1:03:20 things i try to say i'm not cutting edge
1:03:24 i to be honest i don't i don't need to
1:03:26 be let's say a modeling part
1:03:27 i'm not cutting edge
1:03:29 the part that for me it really pays off
1:03:31 to be
1:03:33 let's say more cutting edge or more
1:03:35 let's say
1:03:36 being on the on the
1:03:37 on the latest it's already around the
1:03:40 engineering point of view of data
1:03:42 science okay
1:03:43 because that way i think we're very
1:03:45 delayed as a dog
1:03:48 or or let's say our traits the world of
1:03:51 data science right
1:03:52 uh it's past you at least five years
1:03:55 right with the practices like
1:03:58 as a profession it grows super fast
1:04:00 right like we have now probably 10x the
1:04:03 amount of data scientists
1:04:05 that we had five years ago
1:04:09 and the practice is uh to work in such a
1:04:12 large teams
1:04:13 across the companies uh
1:04:15 uh
1:04:16 are adapting all the time because it's
1:04:18 something new to work with so many data
1:04:19 scientists so that's the only thing i
1:04:21 keep up super app today right what we
1:04:23 call i don't know any loves uh
1:04:28 i guess right i think we have talked
1:04:29 about this a few times with alex
1:04:33 like
1:04:34 yes
1:04:35 that's it what is the melops what is not
1:04:38 yeah but
1:04:39 basically predictionizing the machine
1:04:41 learning right
1:04:42 yeah also all the processes and how
1:04:44 people communicate
1:04:46 like how
1:04:47 the process looks like what are the
1:04:49 tools that we need to use exactly the
1:04:51 systems around the processes right or
1:04:54 how each other shape each other right
1:04:55 like
1:04:56 like the systems to supports the
1:04:58 processes to to make it easy right
1:05:01 uh
1:05:02 like they also the right level of
1:05:04 uh you know
1:05:07 lean you know that the things are simple
1:05:09 to use but at the same time they help
1:05:11 you and they don't they
1:05:13 that they help you with the process they
1:05:15 make an efficient process but they are
1:05:17 not
1:05:18 they can can i insult right they are not
1:05:19 a pain in the ass right like i i'm very
1:05:22 allergic to bureaucracy right so when
1:05:24 the process takes you more than
1:05:27 time than the the thing you're actually
1:05:29 doing for me it's not working right but
1:05:33 yeah
1:05:35 yeah i just took a look at the questions
1:05:36 i prepared for you and i realized that
1:05:39 uh
1:05:40 i covered only like 10 percent of them
1:05:43 that's my fault i told you i speak too
1:05:45 much
1:05:46 no but like we actually diverse and i
1:05:49 think it turned out to be better than uh
1:05:52 what i had in mind so yeah thanks a lot
