0:01 now hello everyone this week we'll talk
0:03 about machine learning in healthcare
0:05 and in particular about personalities
0:08 personalization in healthcare and we
0:10 have a special guest today stefan is it
0:12 stefan right not stefan yeah stefan or
0:15 stefan if you want to be uh
0:18 stefan
0:19 stefan okay
0:20 um so stefan is from iceland at some
0:24 point he moved to sweden where he worked
0:25 at king and h m then he moved back
0:28 from
0:30 to iceland and joined sidekick health as
0:32 a director of data science and ai so
0:35 welcome stefan thank you
0:39 so before we go into our main topic of
0:41 machine learning in healthcare and
0:44 personalization in healthcare let's
0:46 start with your background can you tell
0:48 us about your career journey so far
0:50 yes absolutely but i i think i better be
0:54 sort of shorten it a little bit i think
0:56 i have my first job but the age of 12 in
0:59 last century so i'll just do
1:02 very short snapshots of the early career
1:04 and then focus on the
1:06 more relevant stuff so
1:09 i started working as a developer rather
1:11 young like 18 with in a part-time job
1:16 in high school
1:17 then that was in 96
1:21 in 99 i was able to build my first or i
1:24 was given a task of building my first
1:26 data pipeline for the notorious y2k
1:29 problem that was very interesting
1:32 and much of my
1:34 sort of early developing work was around
1:37 [Music]
1:38 building programs that could control the
1:41 graphics and tv programs like uh live
1:44 sports shows and election programs and
1:46 things like that
1:47 so i i still today think i've written
1:50 most of my
1:52 lines in a programming language called
1:54 delphi that nobody uses anymore
1:56 um
1:58 that's that was my first language oh
2:00 really
2:01 yeah very nice
2:03 yeah it's a nice one
2:05 nobody cares about it anymore but it was
2:07 nice
2:08 i think she shot took over at some point
2:10 uh in 2006 and seven i had a great
2:14 experience where i was building an
2:17 enterprise state of eros from scratch
2:19 with a great team at uh the largest
2:21 telecom company in iceland and uh that
2:24 experience has sort of helped me a lot
2:26 in the in my current
2:28 and recent years but if i fast forward
2:30 over these snapshots and then
2:33 sort of start being more current
2:36 uh i i think i'll start in 2015 where i
2:40 left took a very good decision but a
2:42 difficult one i left a
2:44 very nice and cozy job as a director of
2:47 analytics and modeling and one of the
2:49 main three major banks in iceland
2:52 and
2:52 moved with my family to stockholm
2:56 where i joined king the makers of
2:58 canticross
3:00 and that was
3:02 a great experience most of the time
3:04 there i spent building the ai team there
3:06 and the a research sort of part of that
3:09 team also where we
3:11 did a lot of collaboration with
3:13 universities and i supervised
3:16 quite a few master students and we were
3:17 building
3:18 some nice products some failed some were
3:21 successful
3:23 so maybe maybe we discussed that a
3:25 little bit later
3:28 in 2019 i decided to move over to h m
3:31 still in stockholm uh they were in the
3:34 very early phase of building up a
3:36 machine learning function machine
3:38 learning team
3:39 and as you can imagine one of the
3:40 biggest retailers in the world with
3:42 awesome data and sort of few images text
3:45 recognition and all of these things
3:47 come together
3:49 so i learned a lot there and just
3:51 we were focusing a lot on okay what's
3:53 the best team structure how do we build
3:54 what's the best practices and solving
3:56 all of these problems
3:58 so that was the early part of that job
3:59 when we got more people in i moved more
4:01 into a similar part that i had
4:04 been doing at king before so this
4:06 research collaboration
4:09 with universities master students
4:11 sort of trying to be the translator
4:13 between the state of the art and
4:15 academia that we're only focusing on the
4:18 latest methods and then the business
4:20 people that are only focusing on money
4:21 and don't care about the methods so
4:23 you're trying to
4:24 sort of merge these two and then be in
4:26 between there too to sort of create some
4:29 value out of that collaboration
4:31 uh
4:33 late 2020
4:35 i was offered
4:38 this position at
4:39 sidekick health
4:41 a startup scale up
4:45 living in with the main office in
4:47 iceland but we have offices both in
4:49 berlin and boston and stockholm
4:52 but
4:53 the job there was basically to build up
4:56 the data science and ai team uh in the
4:59 company and
5:01 sort of
5:02 to
5:03 contribute to making this uh
5:06 what i hope it will become a
5:09 fantastic data-driven company with
5:11 world-class machine learning solutions
5:13 and digital therapeutics solutions so
5:16 that's that's something i had to
5:17 basically jump on and started there in
5:19 early 2021
5:22 so this is a completely off topic but i
5:25 can't help but answer but ask you
5:28 how islamic and swedish different are
5:30 they very different languages or they're
5:32 similar
5:34 well i i sometimes explain this as sort
5:36 of 1000 years ago it was the same
5:38 language
5:40 and then sweden and denmark and norway
5:43 decided to evolve but we did not
5:45 so we can still read the icelandic sagas
5:47 from 1200
5:49 something
5:51 yeah i think that's the main difference
5:53 so we still have more inflections more
5:56 sort of nuances
5:58 that usually
5:59 evolve out of languages
6:01 through vikings right
6:04 i don't know about that okay so like
6:07 coming back to our topic main topic of
6:09 machine learning in healthcare
6:11 usually when i hear machine learning in
6:14 healthcare i think about
6:17 well in general in healthcare usually i
6:19 think about clinical trials but when in
6:21 particular people talk about machine
6:23 learning then i imagine all these x-ray
6:25 images or some images
6:28 and then people would run deep learning
6:30 on top of these images
6:32 so this is mostly about processing
6:34 medical images
6:36 exactly is this correct or there are
6:38 more applications of machine learning in
6:40 healthcare there are
6:43 of course i
6:44 myself i i this is what comes first to
6:47 mind i mean a typical
6:48 sort of vision you have is there's an
6:51 x-ray of some broken arm or or whatnot
6:54 and and then you have a deep learning
6:56 emits recognition to tell you okay this
6:58 is wrong to this
7:00 that is a use case of course but there
7:02 are many more and uh
7:04 to name a few i mean disease diagnosis
7:07 where you where you maybe have symptoms
7:10 and measurements but it's not obvious
7:12 okay what disease is this so trying to
7:15 automatically
7:16 uh distinguish or or sort of recognize
7:19 that
7:21 there's a lot of
7:22 work in of course through the pharmacy
7:24 companies and
7:25 things related to that drug discovery
7:28 okay
7:28 what kind of drugs can you have are they
7:30 related
7:32 can they be tailored to your gene
7:34 settings or something like that
7:36 uh i think we've all probably heard
7:38 about deep mind and the alpha fault
7:40 where they are trying to predict the
7:42 folding of proteins which can be uh
7:47 turned out to be a very big sort of game
7:49 changer in this sort of to understand
7:51 the biology
7:53 behind all of this and and then you can
7:55 move into more sort of personalized
7:56 medicine uh where
7:59 you get different drugs and slightly
8:02 different treatments for example for for
8:03 your cancer treatment based on your
8:05 background and medical history and
8:06 things like that
8:08 and there are probably many more that
8:09 i'm not mentioning but just to name a
8:12 few
8:14 do you know anything about this alpha
8:16 for alpha fault i heard that it exists
8:18 but my knowledge of biology is so
8:20 non-existent that i couldn't appreciate
8:23 the
8:25 the well i heard that it's there was a
8:27 breakthrough in biology because of deep
8:29 learning but i don't know anything about
8:31 the biology to really appreciate this
8:34 i'm a little bit ashamed to say that
8:36 today uh when i was younger i i thought
8:39 that biology was a little bit inferior
8:42 we didn't have enough numbers
8:44 so
8:45 i'm probably the same i'm sort of not
8:47 very good with biology but i i read the
8:49 paper uh on alphavolt from deepmind and
8:53 it seems very interesting but i i
8:56 i'm on the same page as you are i'm not
8:58 an expert on this at all
9:01 so did you understand a lot in that
9:03 paper or your lack of knowledge in
9:05 biology
9:07 no i think well it's
9:10 been some time since i read it also i
9:12 couldn't really quote it but i i
9:14 in my memory i
9:16 thought i interested
9:18 but
9:19 that's probably also
9:20 uh because deepmind puts a lot of effort
9:23 into making uh their
9:25 sort of content
9:27 uh accessible by by the public so i've
9:30 read and
9:32 taken much more deep dive on the uh
9:35 earlier stuff they did they did on the
9:37 alphago and
9:39 alpha zero
9:40 and that's very accessible or can be
9:44 yeah i guess the target audience of this
9:46 paper
9:47 are machine learning researchers not
9:50 biologists right or maybe both uh
9:53 probably both but then then they are
9:55 usually
9:56 they usually uh get to publish in nature
9:59 as well so that's where they
10:01 uh so everyone is basically every
10:03 scientist is becomes the target audience
10:06 so and before this episode i was
10:09 doing a little bit research about the
10:10 company where you work at right now
10:12 sidekick health
10:14 and i know that this is in healthcare
10:16 domain
10:17 and
10:18 yeah i thought maybe you're doing these
10:20 medical images like other healthcare
10:22 companies so i went to the website i
10:25 checked the description and it was
10:27 saying that you're doing gamified
10:29 digital therapeutics built on science
10:32 rooted in behavioral economics and
10:34 scalable across multiple therapeutic
10:36 areas i must admit that most of these
10:39 words do not tell me anything
10:42 so i'm not sure i really understood what
10:44 you do so maybe can you
10:47 decipher what it actually means i i can
10:50 try
10:52 no no it should be very simple but you
10:54 know how sometimes the language and web
10:56 pages are
10:58 sort of uh putting a
11:02 specific customer
11:03 uh
11:04 yes so i mean that that's another field
11:07 in
11:08 sort of uh
11:10 machine learning and ai in healthcare is
11:14 sort of the treatment itself can we
11:16 personalize the treatment more can we
11:18 get more out of the treatment if you we
11:19 take a step back and think about okay
11:22 we have streamlined healthcare in many
11:24 ways and
11:26 which is great we i mean we know you
11:28 come into a doctor you meet them for
11:30 five minutes they diagnose you
11:32 you get a treatment or medicine and
11:34 you're out
11:35 nothing more to be done i mean this is
11:38 a lot of our experience of of health
11:41 and often this is just enough
11:44 but all this streamlining also means
11:46 that if you have multiple diseases you
11:49 you're not really getting that
11:51 communication you just go to an expert
11:53 they treat one thing
11:56 and
11:57 you you're not you're really losing the
11:59 empathy right because it's been
12:02 streamlined so much
12:04 so and and there are studies showing
12:06 that empathy is a big factor in and
12:08 often sort of better outcomes or
12:10 treatments and all of that
12:12 so our goal is basically
12:14 so
12:14 we want to maximize the quality life
12:16 years of a person's life
12:19 so that sometimes means we can try to
12:21 cure a disease or help them live longer
12:24 it also means there are a lot of people
12:26 that have chronic diseases which they
12:28 have to live with for decades but just
12:30 being able to educate them and help them
12:33 taking the right steps developing their
12:36 sort of uh daily habits in a better way
12:40 can actually increase the quality of
12:42 life
12:43 substantially
12:44 so that that's what we're trying to
12:46 build these sort of we have more touch
12:48 points with the
12:49 users and patients than you would do in
12:52 normal healthcare because you have this
12:53 through an app
12:55 but
12:56 in the app but also trying to
12:57 personalize so you feel better you are
12:59 better engaged we try to personalize all
13:01 the content you you get you we take into
13:03 account if you have more than one
13:05 disease and then we try to merge this
13:07 together in a in a nice way but that
13:09 that is a huge task and of course work
13:12 in progress
13:13 uh
13:14 and at the same time we're trying to add
13:17 this gamification level on top of it
13:18 because
13:19 a big factor in
13:21 changing behavior of people criteria
13:24 over time is the engagement so we need
13:26 to engage and
13:28 need to feel excited about what you're
13:30 doing
13:32 so what we do there is that we we have
13:35 collaboration with uh
13:37 sort of charity uh and we create uh an
13:40 incentive in the app so every time you
13:42 finish a task we give you
13:44 you are handed out this altruistic
13:46 reward so you collect water drops and
13:49 then you can donate the water drops to
13:50 people in need of fresh water and then
13:52 in the background we are collaborating
13:54 with a charity that
13:55 takes care of that
13:57 so that's the sort of setup of this
13:59 we're trying to merge this and sort of
14:01 three main factors of people in the
14:04 company are medical doctors so we have
14:05 all the background and expert knowledge
14:08 of the diseases then behavioral
14:10 psychologists that know everything that
14:12 is
14:13 that you should know about sort of how
14:15 do you get people to
14:17 take the steps towards change how can
14:18 you not stand towards the right change
14:20 and then people like myself and more
14:22 people in the company with a background
14:24 in the gaming industry so we're trying
14:26 to merge these three together to create
14:28 this kind of uh
14:29 engaging solution that can help you
14:32 improve your life
14:34 yeah so when you mentioned
14:36 gamification and
14:38 creating more engagement i
14:40 um
14:41 since you worked at king
14:42 so i played some
14:44 games from king like bubble which for
14:46 example and
14:48 king
14:49 does it really well like to getting
14:52 people on the hook
14:53 yes so i think you really mastered that
14:57 king so i guess this is one of the
14:59 things that is quite useful now from
15:01 your past experience right that you know
15:03 can apply
15:04 yes yes but at the same time there are
15:06 critical differences i mean we don't
15:09 want to
15:10 want to keep you in the app four hours
15:13 because most of the activity you need to
15:14 do is outside of the app so that is a
15:17 very interesting
15:18 difference between the two
15:20 use cases
15:21 yeah
15:22 and as i understood correctly your the
15:25 main target audience of the app are
15:27 patients not the doctors or both
15:29 uh no the main target is the patient but
15:31 we are collaborating with
15:34 sort of pharmacy companies or insurance
15:36 providers
15:37 [Music]
15:39 not doctors who take patients every day
15:43 not at the moment
15:45 yeah because i imagine that they don't
15:47 really care much about gamification they
15:49 just have so many patients to deal with
15:51 so they just probably don't have time
15:54 so if i understood correctly
15:57 what you do is let's say a person has
16:00 some disease some chronic disease
16:02 and
16:03 they need to enter this details right
16:06 and up and then the up would they tell
16:08 you okay you need to i don't know drink
16:11 more water drink less coffee exercise
16:13 more this is what my doctor tells me
16:15 every day
16:17 yes but i
16:19 there's a little bit more than that but
16:22 but you you are
16:24 today you are given a specific pin code
16:27 where that you can go in and that and
16:30 that you enter the right program right
16:32 away
16:33 uh but
16:34 a big big part of
16:37 take
16:38 i mean typical diabetes patient for
16:41 example
16:42 uh
16:43 a big proportion of people dealing with
16:46 diabetes uh
16:48 are dealing with problems that come from
16:50 lack of health literacy
16:52 so just having very accessible content
16:55 on
16:56 okay you have this disease because of
16:59 this you can control it with this just
17:02 having that in a very clear way because
17:05 speaking to a doctor that can be
17:06 difficult as i said they have five
17:08 minutes they speak talk their language
17:11 and are often very proud of that
17:13 language so you don't understand half of
17:15 what they say
17:16 so that's the first step just to get
17:19 closer to the people so they feel okay
17:21 there is empathy here you you really
17:23 care about me you can't speak to me and
17:25 so educate people about okay
17:27 maybe your diet isn't the best this is
17:29 your disease you need to think about the
17:31 diet and how you're asked and how you
17:32 exercise
17:34 but that's just the starting part and
17:36 then we
17:37 you need to create a program where you
17:39 sort of step by step with your behavior
17:41 psychology you you nuts people towards
17:44 creating habits i mean that's the
17:46 non-trivial task
17:47 to do i mean you know how often you you
17:50 start something you have great hopes and
17:52 and then you've maybe failed so
17:56 every january
17:58 every january
18:01 and then like maybe first week i'm
18:04 so adamant about doing exercises and
18:06 then oh it's winter i don't really want
18:08 to run uh maybe i'll wait summer but
18:10 when it's summer
18:13 a big part of that is this behavioral
18:15 psychology i mean the goal setting is
18:17 maybe not the best you you aim too high
18:19 or
18:20 you don't have sort of small steps to
18:22 gradually push you towards something you
18:24 don't have someone constantly reminding
18:26 you as a like a friendly ass where it's
18:28 just it's okay don't worry continue
18:31 we all forget one day continue let's try
18:34 to do 3000 steps today something like
18:37 that
18:38 ah interesting
18:40 i really wanted to try it you know
18:45 yeah so um we already talked a bit about
18:48 um how your previous background was
18:50 useful like
18:52 and keep for example
18:54 where you knew how to
18:56 attract or keep people engaged but there
18:59 is a difference yeah but it also seems
19:02 like it's quite different from your
19:03 previous jobs right so previously you
19:05 were working more like uh
19:08 although now when i think about this so
19:10 actually this is an app and what you
19:12 were doing before it was also enough so
19:14 to some extent there are some
19:15 similarities right
19:16 so maybe can you tell us about the
19:18 differences
19:19 between what you do now and what you do
19:22 you're doing before as a data scientist
19:24 let's say
19:27 exactly i i think
19:29 uh i think it's much more similar than
19:31 you would think in the beginning
19:33 so
19:34 you are you are basically you have a
19:36 program some kind of solution
19:39 and you're in a company where you really
19:41 want to create this data-driven culture
19:43 from the data science sort of
19:45 perspective
19:46 and you want decisions to be data-driven
19:49 if you're going to change features in
19:50 the app you want them to be backed by
19:52 data
19:54 and you want some kind of machine
19:55 learning part of it as well
19:58 so
19:58 on a very high level it's actually very
20:01 similar
20:02 so just
20:03 you you need to create this culture you
20:04 need to build up the infrastructure
20:08 and have the buy-in from the business
20:09 people that
20:10 okay don't just shoot from the hip we
20:13 need to be data-driven so that's
20:16 exactly the same in both places
20:19 but as i
20:20 sort of hinted earlier there is a big
20:23 big and very interesting difference in
20:25 because we have social media we have
20:28 gaming apps
20:30 that are optimizing
20:32 for just keeping you in the app forever
20:34 or whatever platform they're working on
20:36 they give you content they give you
20:40 they they play on your
20:42 feelings and that's all the debate about
20:45 facebook that is dividing people into
20:47 because it's it's always optimized to
20:49 give you more and more sort of people
20:51 that you get more emotional about
20:54 we are we're not trying this we don't
20:56 care if you're just 10 minutes a day and
20:58 yeah just reading the educational
21:00 content seeing okay these are my tasks
21:02 i'll do them then you come in again okay
21:04 i finished this
21:06 something like that that's that's fine
21:08 if you just follow the path and and sort
21:10 of get better
21:12 so that's the main main difference there
21:14 uh and there is a main metric for you so
21:19 let's say
21:20 games like that like candy crush bubble
21:22 which they aim at optimizing maximizing
21:26 the time you spend
21:27 in the app
21:28 right so time you spend playing i guess
21:31 for you or the money you spend
21:33 well but the money yes uh depends on how
21:36 exactly you monetize this particular
21:37 user
21:38 but then when we talk about
21:40 your application that you work on right
21:42 now
21:44 something that comes to my mind is how
21:46 often people return right so how often
21:48 they like how many days let's say they
21:51 open so probably what you want to to
21:53 have is like people open the up every
21:55 day it doesn't matter if it's five
21:57 minutes or
21:58 so
21:59 is it the metric you want to optimize or
22:00 there's something else yes no exactly so
22:03 creating a habit is exactly this you
22:04 need to just okay if we can make you
22:07 open three o'clock in the afternoon the
22:09 app for 10 minutes every day
22:11 i mean that would be awesome for us then
22:13 you're probably following i mean it's
22:15 only a proxy
22:16 but it's probably highly correlated with
22:18 you following the therapy that for the
22:20 program we give you and you are
22:22 gradually building up a habit building
22:24 up a habit takes weeks or months so just
22:28 just being able to have this
22:31 happening repeatedly is more important
22:34 than you staying in the app for hours or
22:37 much more importantly we absolutely
22:38 don't want you to spend time in the app
22:40 and you should be out working
22:44 yes but there is another
22:45 difference also with with sort of
22:48 an environment like cantacross you you
22:50 are with patients in treatment so you
22:53 have to be much more careful about
22:55 i mean if you're if you're changing a
22:56 feature in candy crush okay should
22:59 should this level be slightly more
23:01 difficult or slightly easier
23:03 than it is today i mean you just do it
23:06 and see what happens in the health care
23:09 and eb test right yes in the healthcare
23:11 app you you really need to be careful
23:13 okay let's
23:15 make sure that this is this is okay
23:17 we're going to be not jeopardizing
23:19 anyone's health
23:21 and that the experiment in this uh
23:23 scenario could be like let's ask people
23:25 instead of walking three thousand steps
23:28 per day
23:29 let's ask them to walk four thousand
23:32 steps and then we see if it changes the
23:34 habit right no exactly and that's
23:37 i mean that's why
23:39 companies like
23:40 king and sort of the games like candy
23:42 crush and the social media are so good
23:45 that
23:46 retaining you is that they are
23:48 constantly experimenting and doing maybe
23:50 tests giving giving the audience two or
23:53 three different versions and then okay
23:55 you pick up internet of that and then
23:56 you could actually build that to a
23:58 better better or more engaging solution
24:00 so we are definitely
24:02 doing that ap testing a lot but the the
24:05 metric we are optimizing for is not
24:07 necessarily click through rate or
24:09 or time spent
24:11 have you ever used duolingo
24:14 yes
24:15 yeah so for those who haven't so this is
24:18 a tool an app for
24:20 learning languages and they have
24:23 gamification gamification inside to keep
24:25 you motivated to learn my wife is
24:27 actually using it to learn french right
24:29 now
24:30 and
24:31 i can see that
24:33 they did quite a good job of
24:35 keeping people
24:36 engaged and
24:39 also making sure that they come back
24:42 and
24:43 yeah so the question we have from gregor
24:46 is
24:46 i'm wondering how much of difficulty it
24:49 is to enforce such behavior that you can
24:51 push using approaches like like that um
24:56 like duolingo
24:57 by adding gamification um like
25:01 does this reward that you get help
25:05 yes so and we do a lot of ux research of
25:08 course where we interview people
25:10 afterwards and ask them okay what is
25:12 working what is not working what needs
25:14 improvement and people are
25:16 sort of
25:18 generally very happy with the reward
25:20 system
25:21 uh and they are
25:23 sort of
25:24 especially probably the
25:26 strongest part is this kind of empathy
25:29 and the the companionship you feel with
25:32 it talk about the reward system right uh
25:35 did we maybe you can also mention
25:37 a few words say a few words what kind of
25:39 reward they get for i not working 4 000
25:42 steps yes so we we give them a task uh
25:46 every day according to our program so
25:47 and every time they they finish the task
25:49 they collect water drops at the moment
25:52 all right we did but
25:55 that can be extended then you're looking
25:56 into sort of okay maybe
25:59 we want to offer them
26:00 through different kind of charity
26:02 collaboration uh a different kind of
26:03 reward so it's closer to your heart i
26:05 mean planting trees in the amazon or
26:09 some something else so
26:12 it's it's more engaging you're more
26:14 enthusiastic about okay i really want to
26:17 do this donation
26:21 because in duolingo the reward system
26:23 that they have is
26:25 just made out of thin air right yes like
26:28 it's basically you have a leaderboard
26:29 and you compete against people you don't
26:31 know
26:32 and uh somehow it works right and then
26:34 obviously it works
26:36 you see in many games uh where you have
26:38 this vanity items that people really
26:42 respond to that
26:43 uh we just thought that
26:45 for
26:46 this kind of app that we are building
26:48 you need a little bit more
26:52 okay maybe can you tell what kind of
26:55 problems does your team solve
26:57 maybe you can also mention a few last
26:59 projects that you worked on
27:02 yes so
27:05 we have been putting a lot of effort
27:06 into
27:08 just building the foundation
27:10 i mean i started
27:12 a little over a year ago
27:14 and then we were
27:16 sort of a much smaller company and two
27:18 data scientists and it was nothing in
27:20 place basically
27:21 so we needed to build up
27:24 all the foundation and
27:26 infrastructure so build data pipelines
27:29 dashboards
27:30 uh
27:31 just as first steps to make everyone
27:34 data driven and i have a very sort of
27:36 personally probably a strong opinion
27:38 about okay we want to go into machine
27:40 learning and personalization but
27:42 every machine learning project you start
27:45 with our proper analytics and then
27:48 proper data is bound to fail
27:50 and sort of so that's why we have been
27:53 putting a lot of effort in into the
27:54 foundation
27:55 and building up a b testing capabilities
27:59 and
28:00 things like that but that's it we have
28:04 done a lot of that so we are able to
28:06 start and have have started working on
28:09 uh
28:11 what we think are pretty exciting
28:14 projects i mean the personalization is
28:16 going to be a key part in this
28:18 uh so we have some simple uh some simple
28:22 logic today but we want to make that
28:24 so much much more advanced so the
28:27 treatment personalization the the task
28:29 we give you
28:30 the
28:31 sort of the modules you get
28:33 at each given point in time is the
28:36 correct one the one you need at the
28:37 moment i mean people are very different
28:40 with a chronic disease you might want to
28:42 be
28:43 quite depressed
28:44 then we need to sort of slow down okay
28:46 let's
28:47 not put two demanding tasks on you let's
28:50 give you content where you can do more
28:52 mindfulness and things like that so we
28:54 need to be
28:55 very adapted to this and then just all
28:57 the tasks you're giving given okay we
28:59 know that people are that are similar to
29:01 you they they like these kind of tasks
29:04 uh we have cops
29:06 interrupt you sorry i'm really curious
29:08 about this slowing down do you have a
29:10 model that says okay this user seems
29:13 like
29:13 not in a good mood so like you have a
29:16 model that detects that and then based
29:17 on that you
29:20 at the moment we have uh
29:22 rather frequent questionnaires so you
29:24 can
29:25 self-assess how you are yeah like if you
29:27 can if you can solve something without
29:29 machine learning
29:31 just ask the user
29:33 yeah i mean you should start there
29:36 so i think that should always be the
29:38 approach i mean start with something
29:39 simple and then you have data then you
29:40 have everything in place to automate it
29:42 don't try to automate others in there
29:46 but we also have just we see the
29:48 activity in the app is it dropping and
29:50 we have started and want to go much more
29:52 into that direction where we have
29:54 your variables where you can sort of
29:56 measure your heart rate variability or
29:58 your sort of the number of steps
30:01 we already have that of course but but
30:03 more and more and more of this
30:09 yeah i see that so usually when i think
30:11 of healthcare healthcare industry i
30:14 might be wrong don't judge me i never
30:16 worked in healthcare
30:17 but usually when i think about this it's
30:19 regulated it's quite slow there is a lot
30:21 of legacy software
30:23 a lot of outdated software
30:27 but what you describe me is pretty much
30:30 different from that right so you're you
30:32 realize the importance about having
30:34 proper analytics data pipelines having
30:36 all these a b tests
30:38 is it because you're like a you said
30:40 it's a scale up so you it's uh recently
30:44 um it's a rather fresh company right so
30:46 you now realize of the importance of
30:49 being data driven and all that right
30:52 no i i i think
30:54 i mean usually innovation is at its best
30:58 when you have
30:59 experts from different fields coming
31:01 together and somehow the space between
31:03 them that makes all the magic and i i
31:05 think that's what we have so having the
31:07 medical doctors and the behavioral
31:08 psychologists that come with all of the
31:10 theory and everything around the uh
31:13 of disease and
31:15 psychology
31:16 but then you have a lot of people coming
31:18 from gaming industry not only myself the
31:20 cto and uh many of the developers that
31:23 developed
31:24 sort of
31:25 the whole solution from the beginning
31:26 they all come from the gaming industry
31:28 so you have this kind of uh dynamic
31:30 there that i think is is very important
31:32 i mean the gaming industry is very data
31:34 driven in general and people are always
31:36 testing out their hypotheses
31:40 and yeah we have a question so i
31:42 mentioned that healthcare is quite a
31:44 regulated area
31:46 and
31:47 usually in healthcare people take it
31:50 very seriously
31:52 questions about data privacy and this
31:54 kind of stuff
31:56 does it change the way you work
31:58 having in mind that you have to to to
32:01 keep these things in mind like data
32:03 privacy and all that and how difficult
32:06 it becomes that you need to deal with
32:08 yeah all these kind of things
32:10 i
32:11 absolutely love the question
32:13 i think i think it's the other way
32:15 around i think all the other industries
32:18 need to pick up with data privacy and
32:20 they are
32:21 gradually but we have seen so many
32:24 instances of
32:25 data abuse
32:27 so i i don't see this as a problem i see
32:29 this is a sort of
32:31 great then i'm starting at the right
32:34 right hand i'm not starting with
32:36 everything messed up and then
32:38 gradually trying to clean it up i start
32:39 just okay this has to be
32:41 good
32:42 so i i think that's just where we are
32:45 moving with every every solution i mean
32:47 apple has for example completely changed
32:50 their policies so you know now your the
32:52 default settings are usually opt-in
32:53 instead of opt-out and i mean there's a
32:56 huge change happening in this
32:59 you basically need to do a lot of uh
33:01 prior work
33:03 um
33:04 to prepare for that and then once you
33:05 have a framework in place that can take
33:07 care of all this data privacy issues
33:10 then you can move as fast as in let's
33:12 say a traditional
33:15 company id company so we just make sure
33:18 that
33:18 we're using the best possible solutions
33:22 and we make sure that okay first there
33:24 is a
33:25 personally identifiable
33:27 data
33:28 and and that's very sort of locked
33:31 locked away but then we just
33:33 de-personalize all the data and then the
33:35 data scientists and data analysts come
33:37 in and they can do
33:39 all of the same work as before they just
33:40 never see the personalized data
33:44 and how do we so there is a question
33:46 from nelson how do we in general deal
33:49 with issues of ethics in
33:51 healthcare when it comes to machine
33:52 learning
33:54 sorry can you repeat i didn't yeah the
33:56 question is how do we deal with issues
33:58 of ethics and machine learning in health
33:59 care like i guess you mentioned one of
34:01 these things is making sure that uh you
34:03 know following the apple suggestions
34:06 opt in instead of opt-out right and then
34:10 now
34:11 keeping track of all personalized data
34:13 and unless we really need it we don't
34:14 use it right things like this
34:16 how else we can deal with all this uh
34:19 ethical issues that uh
34:21 that come together with
34:24 you know medical data
34:26 yeah i think
34:28 well
34:29 first of all ethics means that you need
34:32 people to think sort of
34:35 independently
34:36 because ethics is different from just
34:38 the rules
34:40 right i think that's an important fact
34:42 you you need to
34:43 have people that are
34:45 sort of really care about this so they
34:48 care about the patient okay we're trying
34:50 to do the best for them but i mean we
34:53 can be hurting them if we don't do this
34:55 the best way we can i think you
34:56 mentioned right so yes empathetic
34:59 and and you have in i mean we have of
35:02 course then rules like ggbr and apa
35:05 in the us where you they are quite
35:08 strict and very very useful and should
35:10 be used everywhere
35:13 of course
35:15 but i
35:17 think you also always need this kind of
35:19 independent thinking because then you're
35:22 you're always
35:23 gonna end up on a
35:26 crossroad okay am i crossing a
35:28 gray line here or not where the rules
35:30 are not cutting up with you i mean they
35:32 always come afterwards
35:35 so i i think that's needed as well
35:38 okay
35:40 yeah so
35:41 i wanted to go back to what we were
35:43 talking about and then
35:46 so you said that the app based on the
35:48 customer profile question profile makes
35:51 different recommendations and then
35:52 personalized recommendations based on
35:54 that maybe can you tell us a bit more
35:56 about that like how does this
35:58 personalization work
36:01 yes so
36:02 again this is of course work in progress
36:05 but
36:05 uh
36:06 i think it's
36:08 quite interesting i mean think
36:10 about spotify and netflix
36:14 there you have recommended systems are
36:17 are always giving you more and more
36:19 content similar to what you like before
36:21 you have this collaborative filtering
36:23 where you are sort of through some nice
36:26 technique matrix factorization or
36:28 something more advanced
36:29 uh you're sort of you know how people
36:32 similar to you
36:33 how they watch content that you haven't
36:35 seen before
36:38 but
36:39 i think what we are trying to do i
36:41 sometimes explain this internally as
36:43 sort of
36:44 imagine spotify where you come in and
36:46 you have
36:47 you have a
36:48 heavy metal profile you you listen to
36:51 rock music and but spotify has an agenda
36:54 they want you to listen to country music
36:57 so they're trying to nudge you towards
36:58 that so first they give you occasional
37:00 johnny cast songs
37:02 but after two months you're just
37:04 listening to dolly pastor so that's kind
37:07 of the recommended system we are trying
37:09 to build we're trying to move you
37:11 gradually towards uh better behavior and
37:14 and maybe it's not as difficult as
37:16 making you listen to dolly parton but
37:18 it's still a very interesting task it's
37:20 sort of recommend the system with with
37:22 an agenda
37:24 does a spotify actually do that
37:28 to make you listen to telepathic
37:30 i i don't know
37:33 well when it comes to podcasts um i
37:35 think they are trying to make me listen
37:37 to joe rogan
37:40 maybe maybe
37:41 but
37:42 that's probably just coming from
37:43 marketing then i don't think i'm working
37:46 for them
37:50 it's one of their but this is uh like
37:53 spotify
37:55 jose well this is their podcast right so
37:57 they
37:58 that's why they advertise it everywhere
38:01 okay interesting and in this case in
38:03 your case country music would be
38:07 better
38:08 habits
38:09 yes kind of of course it's an analogy so
38:12 it's it's not perfect analogy i just
38:14 thought it was funny to bring in country
38:16 i'm not a big fan of them
38:20 the country is music is
38:22 good for your health right
38:25 yeah okay and now i see where the
38:26 analysis is breaking
38:27 [Laughter]
38:31 uh i'm wondering so you you say you have
38:34 this collaborative filtering
38:36 and in this case
38:39 um well we have the rows that are users
38:41 or columns whatever so users are users
38:44 right but what are the items that you're
38:46 recommending are they articles
38:48 or are they particular
38:50 you know tasks or things people need to
38:52 do or both yes so we are building up a
38:54 library of content sort of
38:58 i mean from educational content
39:01 sort of
39:02 uh
39:03 videos explaining something
39:05 some
39:06 content cards that you can read
39:08 and then to exercises and then all of
39:10 these things so you we are building up
39:12 this this catalog so we have we'll
39:15 eventually have a large list of of
39:18 products basically to offer you so you
39:20 are ending up with a typical uh
39:23 sort of
39:24 recommended system from that
39:26 but then there is this added flavor in
39:29 the end
39:31 yeah because i imagine if you start
39:33 with recommendations of
39:35 i don't know you need to do 10 push-ups
39:38 per day or something like this
39:39 then for an average person like me oh
39:42 okay i know it's good
39:44 for my health but i'm not going to do
39:46 that
39:47 and you probably want to start slowly
39:49 right
39:50 and push me gradually towards listening
39:52 to country music rather than okay like
39:55 here's the country music listen to it
39:57 yes and exactly and but this touches a
39:59 little bit in on the
40:01 facts of how you approach machine
40:04 learning
40:05 uh
40:06 i i think sort of
40:08 just jumping into a a
40:11 complicated collaborative filtering is
40:13 not the right way
40:14 the first step is maybe just set up on a
40:17 b test and see how two different
40:19 versions of a content work
40:21 i mean then you have asked the
40:23 developers to develop the program in
40:24 such a way that you can actually show
40:26 two different
40:27 contents and that's a key request
40:30 [Music]
40:32 key
40:33 thing you need to have i can't speak
40:36 english anymore sorry uh
40:38 for building up more
40:40 uh sort of more and more advanced
40:42 features i mean just having the
40:45 variant availability
40:47 so you need to start very simple and
40:49 then even if you if you have a variant
40:51 that beats
40:52 on average everything else you can start
40:54 there okay offer that to everyone but
40:57 karate you're building up knowledge and
40:58 data sets that you you can actually
41:00 train on later
41:02 so there are people
41:04 jumping ahead of themselves and then
41:05 sort of okay i know i have the vision of
41:07 this awesome model
41:09 but i have to sort of hold my houses
41:11 it's
41:11 it's not time for the other
41:13 when it comes to a b test there it feels
41:15 to me maybe i'm wrong but they're less
41:17 personalized right so you're trying to
41:20 test the same piece of content or two
41:22 pieces of content in this case if we're
41:24 talking about a b test on the entire
41:26 population or maybe on one segment of
41:28 your users right but this is not the
41:29 same as personalized recommendation but
41:32 it is very
41:33 very
41:34 sort of
41:36 linked
41:37 because
41:38 if if you if you offer everyone unhip
41:40 tests
41:41 to begin with
41:43 uh you
41:45 there are so many low hanging fruits
41:46 that you're just improving your program
41:48 easily if you just take the winner of
41:50 two in every
41:52 test
41:53 but then you gradually reach a point
41:55 where you see okay now i'm increasing
41:57 this but decreasing this or this is good
41:59 for this part of the population but not
42:01 this one okay now you're starting to
42:03 think okay what's the difference between
42:05 these groups and then you maybe see for
42:07 for a mobile game for example you see
42:09 okay these are the payers these are not
42:11 the payers
42:12 okay now you can start to personalize
42:14 you offer this to the players and and
42:16 not to the non-payers
42:19 and then okay this is this is smart how
42:21 about more segments
42:22 and you add a few more segments and now
42:24 you have four or five segments that make
42:26 sense
42:28 but it's starting to get complicated to
42:30 maintain all of these different
42:32 questions so that's where you move into
42:34 okay
42:35 now i actually have a lot of training
42:36 data from all of this testing to see
42:38 okay can i just optimize the calibrated
42:41 filtering or or just clustering to begin
42:43 with okay and i'll just look at the 100
42:46 nearest neighbors of you okay that's uh
42:49 that's the first approach okay there you
42:51 would behave similar to them
42:54 so i think i think this is important so
42:56 the people sort of gradually take the
42:58 baby steps
43:00 and
43:01 here the
43:02 fundamentally important thing is having
43:04 this
43:05 platform for experimenting right if you
43:07 don't have this
43:08 and if you directly jump into
43:10 collaborative filtering or i don't know
43:12 the latest deep learning model for
43:14 recommender systems without having that
43:17 um
43:18 yeah you're moving in the dark right
43:21 yeah exactly so i think
43:22 in my mind the two most important input
43:25 into
43:26 starting a machine learning
43:28 is to have strong analytics you need to
43:30 be able to analyze what is happening you
43:32 need to break down the ap test and
43:34 understand the
43:35 data that you have and then of course
43:36 you need good data
43:38 if either of this is missing uh in my
43:41 experience this is usually the deciding
43:43 factor if you have to have both of them
43:45 the machine learning project will go
43:47 well
43:47 if you are ignoring either of them you
43:50 will probably fail
43:53 or and you fail quite
43:56 late after spending many months right
43:58 exactly that's that's which is even
44:00 worse than just trading right just
44:02 trying to train a model and finding out
44:04 that it's not working on your offline
44:06 data it's one thing but then spending
44:08 many many months trying to build the
44:11 perfect model only to find out that
44:13 users actually don't like it
44:15 exactly and that's what you gain with
44:17 taking the baby steps you'll you're
44:19 always creating value so you know you
44:22 have sort of you know where you stand
44:24 today so you're going from a to b
44:27 and you know where you want to be
44:28 approximately
44:30 and if you just jump to building that b
44:33 part
44:34 you're doing exactly what you explained
44:36 but if you if you try to form a path
44:38 from a to b that gives you the most
44:40 value along the way
44:41 you you will learn much faster and you
44:43 will create value along the way to and
44:45 then get a much better buy-in from
44:46 everyone around you because often when
44:48 you're starting a machine learning
44:49 project there is one person doing
44:51 something so you really need buy-in to
44:53 have more resources more compute power
44:56 and all of these things that you
44:57 actually need
44:59 and i think companies like gaming
45:02 companies and i.t
45:04 tech companies
45:05 e-commerce companies they learned that
45:08 that it's important to have analytics to
45:10 have experimentation platform and all
45:12 that but what do you think is the state
45:14 in the healthcare industry
45:17 do companies that work uh operate
45:19 vendors that operate in this industry do
45:22 they also realize the importance of
45:24 these things
45:25 or
45:25 [Music]
45:27 it's a bit behind
45:29 depending on where you are i mean the
45:33 all
45:34 full pharmacy world
45:36 has been doing this for for decades yeah
45:37 clinical trials they didn't work that
45:40 existed right
45:41 so there is definitely a question for
45:43 this so people are aware of this i mean
45:46 all the kind of biases that you create
45:47 when you don't really have an ap test or
45:49 rct which is the
45:51 some clinical trial uh lingo for it
45:55 uh
45:56 so
45:57 there's a question for all of that and
45:58 they know that okay if you're not not
46:00 doing perfect split in a and b and then
46:03 even c
46:04 you will create biases you you're always
46:08 there's a survival bias when you're only
46:09 measuring the people that actually do
46:12 something
46:13 and all the people that didn't do
46:14 something they just left your platform
46:17 i mean there are so many
46:19 pitfalls in there so there's definitely
46:22 knowledge about this
46:24 but
46:25 maybe
46:26 i'm not knowledgeable enough but there
46:29 might be a difference
46:31 between okay how do you transform that
46:32 to feature improvement in an app
46:35 so that's slightly different because
46:38 typical clinical trials are huge
46:40 they cost terrible amount of money
46:44 and they take years which is when you're
46:46 developing an ah this is no good
46:51 i think general population learned about
46:52 clinical trials
46:54 and now when uh covet uh vaccinations
46:57 were tested right and everyone was
46:59 asking why it takes so long to develop a
47:01 vaccine actually
47:02 because of this thing right so they need
47:04 to test that this thing actually works
47:06 yeah and
47:07 yeah
47:08 why it takes a long it was yeah then of
47:11 course a record time in one year when it
47:14 should have taken time
47:15 yeah usually it takes a lot more right
47:17 to actually run all these tests
47:21 well hopefully they worked
47:24 we'll find out soon
47:31 so if i want to work in the healthcare
47:34 industry as a machine learning engineer
47:36 or data scientist or data engineer
47:38 how much do i need to know about
47:40 healthcare in general do i need to have
47:42 like
47:43 md
47:45 puddles to work there
47:48 i think it differs a lot between what
47:51 exactly you're doing
47:53 probably in some
47:56 parts of it you you really need to not
47:58 have uh domain expert knowledge
48:01 but my experience in in just data
48:04 science is it's more important just to
48:07 have the right approach
48:09 so you come to a problem and you know
48:12 okay
48:13 this is the kind of approach i need to
48:15 have i need to take this as we
48:17 talked about earlier take these baby
48:18 steps build up the knowledge
48:20 be humble about okay maybe max
48:22 williamson is wrong maybe there's
48:23 something wrong here and there
48:25 and just this
48:27 way of working is probably more
48:29 important than the domain
48:31 knowledge in many cases but there are
48:34 definitely some cases where
48:36 that's probably not enough
48:40 in your case you mentioned that you have
48:43 medical doctors
48:45 or who are domain experts in your case
48:47 then behavioral scientists who are also
48:50 domain experts and then
48:52 the engineers the data scientists who do
48:54 the
48:56 who take care of the way of working as
48:58 you mentioned right and then what you do
49:01 is basically get everyone in the same
49:02 room virtual room i guess because you're
49:05 in different countries and then we
49:06 figure out okay how do we use this
49:08 knowledge from these people and to put
49:11 this knowledge on their
49:13 you know way of working when it comes to
49:15 data building these analytical platforms
49:18 data pipelines and so on
49:21 was it difficult for you to actually
49:23 learn this
49:24 no not at all i mean all of these people
49:27 are very data driven just by nature
49:31 the
49:32 sort of the biggest challenges may be to
49:34 tell a medical doctor
49:36 okay now we're testing a feature in the
49:38 app let's just test it
49:40 what no no wait
49:42 when we do medical things that's taking
49:44 much more we were much more careful but
49:47 it's all about
49:49 the risk involved if you're testing a
49:51 feature that doesn't have any risk
49:52 involved then i think you should take
49:54 the sort of gaming uh
49:57 industry uh approach
49:59 just test it i mean you your gut feeling
50:01 is
50:02 maybe correct half of the time at best
50:04 just test test ask the users they will
50:07 tell you what much faster and more
50:09 accurately what they like and what they
50:11 don't like
50:12 so but that was a little bit of a
50:15 sort of change
50:16 uh also when you're when you're building
50:18 up a question company you want to build
50:21 sort of our one of our main objectives
50:23 to build a
50:25 data driven company
50:28 and that means
50:29 you you have to be quick enough with the
50:31 answers so the business is making a
50:34 decision now
50:35 so but many data scientists want to sort
50:37 of okay they've studied through
50:40 university okay i need to be perfect in
50:41 what i do
50:43 and if you are
50:45 you are basically
50:46 killing the the objective of being data
50:49 driven you need to be able to act fast
50:51 give
50:52 sort of somewhat accurate numbers but
50:55 they're not perfect
50:56 so that's there's a little bit of
50:58 contradiction in that and that's also
50:59 something that sort of
51:02 needed a lot of communication around so
51:05 if we want to be data-driven we need to
51:07 act fast we need to iterate we start
51:09 with data pipelines that are just
51:11 spaghetti codes just to get something
51:13 out and then you gradually make a proper
51:15 pipeline out of it and they're blowing
51:18 everything you need but if you start
51:19 with no i want to build this in airflow
51:22 let's just rate your silence for months
51:24 for the business
51:27 yeah right
51:28 and you mentioned risk
51:32 and as i understood so for your case
51:34 risk is not that high because you're not
51:36 recommending
51:37 medicine right you're not saying you
51:39 have to take these pills
51:41 it depends i mean some some parts of the
51:44 program can be very sensitive i mean
51:46 okay
51:47 so there is
51:48 some risks
51:49 yes so we cannot recommend it in swedes
51:52 to people with diabetes right
51:55 no no i mean
51:55 [Music]
51:56 an example we often use to remind us
51:59 ourselves of this is i mean if you have
52:01 heart failure problems
52:03 it's not good to drink too much water
52:05 water because your lungs cannot process
52:07 uh
52:09 all of that so you end up with uh liquid
52:11 in your in your lungs
52:13 now but in most other programs it's good
52:14 to drink more water
52:16 so we we could not just create an ap
52:18 test uh let's suggest 10 classes of work
52:22 okay so we always need to have this
52:24 discussion with the medical totals to
52:26 see okay we want to test this does it
52:28 make sense is it safe
52:31 and when it's safe we can be sort of
52:33 very agile about it when it's not safe
52:35 we need to be much more careful
52:38 yeah makes sense makes a lot of sense
52:40 but you don't recommend medicine right
52:42 so you only take it's more like about
52:44 lifestyle rather than
52:47 taking this
52:49 well we are collaborating with
52:52 pharmacy companies but then there is a
52:54 specific medicine that they have been
52:56 prescribed from a doctor before
52:59 yeah so you still need to go to a doctor
53:00 and then say okay this up recommended me
53:02 to take a pill yes we cannot give me a
53:04 clip
53:07 sometimes it's annoying i know i need to
53:09 to have this medicine but i just need to
53:12 go to a doctor and the doctor
53:18 little processors also
53:20 yeah but it's better this way rather
53:22 than i just go to the pharmacy
53:25 by doing self diagnosis right and then
53:27 buy
53:28 i don't know something that can well
53:31 cause more
53:35 so i've heard you're hiring right can
53:37 you tell us more about that
53:39 um yes we've been growing
53:40 very rapidly
53:43 when i started we were
53:45 maybe 30 something or a year ago i think
53:48 we're 130 40 today and we'll probably be
53:51 250 by the end of the year
53:53 so and we are
53:54 rapidly growing the
53:56 data science and ai team
53:58 we are about 10 at the moment i think
54:01 we'll double in size
54:02 until the end of the year and that's
54:04 counting everyone all the data engineers
54:07 all the machine learning engineers data
54:08 analysts data scientists
54:11 everyone included that so yes
54:14 we are looking
54:17 for good people and
54:19 we know that i mean this is a domain
54:22 where it's a fierce competition so we
54:25 are fully aware of that that we we need
54:26 to build the world class solution there
54:29 is no middle ground either you're a
54:30 top-class app or you're dead
54:32 there's nothing in between so we need to
54:34 hire uh
54:36 great people for them
54:39 so you're hiring in germany in sweden
54:41 and in iceland right yeah yes
54:44 that's the focus now so as i said we
54:46 have offices in these countries but also
54:48 in boston but we're focusing on our
54:50 efforts in and
54:53 mostly berlin and stockholm but uh also
54:57 reykjavik but they're just
54:59 as you might know there are fewer people
55:00 in iceland than most other countries
55:03 you're the first guest i we had from
55:07 iceland
55:09 yeah i'm not surprised that many people
55:12 i don't think i know anyone apart from
55:14 you
55:18 i noticed that we have a question uh
55:20 from slider so the question is
55:22 i don't know if you know about this what
55:24 are your thoughts on brain computer
55:25 interfaces like neural link
55:28 do you know anything about this
55:30 oh i i
55:33 i don't know enough to say anything
55:36 intelligent about that i'm afraid
55:40 sorry about that
55:42 do you think ai could be used to treat
55:44 or cure
55:47 psychiatric disorders like bipolar
55:50 disorders
55:52 that's a very interesting question
55:54 of course i'm not sure
55:56 but it could probably
55:59 help
56:00 at least i mean
56:03 this is like
56:05 bipolar diseases
56:08 i mean you're affected a lot by just
56:10 okay now the now there's more brightness
56:12 now there's more darkness so you
56:14 you get more swings than
56:18 so if you can predict that know about
56:20 that in advance and try to if you for
56:22 example could monitor
56:25 the heart rate variability or something
56:27 like that that is okay this is usually
56:30 indication that you're going too high
56:32 it's
56:32 it's been
56:34 raising
56:35 or increasing over the past week
56:38 yeah it could definitely help but but
56:40 cure is that's a different thing
56:42 probably more like learning how to like
56:46 you said with chronic diseases
56:48 um it's more about learning educating
56:51 people how to
56:52 live a better life with these diseases
56:54 right other than
56:56 completely and this is what you do right
56:58 so you
56:59 educate people how to
57:01 to form habits such that
57:04 they can lead a better life
57:07 okay i think on that note we
57:10 can wrap up maybe is there anything is
57:12 there anything you want to mention
57:14 before we finish
57:16 um
57:17 no can't really think of anything just
57:20 thanks a lot for the talk it was very
57:22 very nice talk to you and
57:23 always nice to talk about this this kind
57:25 of subject
57:28 if somebody has questions what's the
57:30 best way to reach out to you linkedin or
57:33 yes
57:36 okay then that's all from me so thanks
57:39 again for joining us today for sharing
57:41 your expertise with us and thanks
57:43 everyone for joining us as well thanks
57:45 for asking questions
57:46 and have a great weekend
57:49 yep like us thanks bye-bye
57:51 goodbye
