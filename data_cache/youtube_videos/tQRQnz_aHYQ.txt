0:00 so let's start with the second talk of
0:02 today
0:03 so we will now talk about personal
0:06 branding
0:06 and we have a special guest today edmund
0:09 so edmond is a data scientist writer and
0:12 speaker
0:13 he's currently a data science instructor
0:15 at hakwagan academy
0:17 with a mission to make data science
0:18 accessible to everyone through education
0:21 so welcome edmund hi let's see yeah
0:24 great to join very excited to join um
0:26 to be a part of the conference here and
0:28 i really you know hope to add values
0:30 to uh well for attending the conference
0:32 here by sharing
0:33 uh you know some of the experience or
0:35 even mistakes along the journey that
0:36 i've encountered so look forward to that
0:38 yeah yes thanks thanks for coming so
0:42 before we go and go into our uh main
0:45 topic for
0:45 for this talk uh about personal brand uh
0:48 let's start with your background
0:50 can you tell us a bit about your career
0:52 journey so far
0:54 yeah sure it's been a roller coaster to
0:56 be honest but then i started i think two
0:59 two and a half years ago so i started
1:01 off as a you know physics student i was
1:03 from a physics background
1:05 and i was uh when i joined the first
1:08 internship the overseas internship back
1:09 then in switzerland
1:11 and i attended you know a machine
1:13 learning workshop my first ever
1:15 machine learning workshop and i fell in
1:17 love with that so when i was back to
1:19 singapore two months later
1:21 i self-learn all these uh so-called
1:24 different data science concepts you know
1:25 machine learning
1:26 and all these different technical and
1:28 non-technical topics
1:30 uh either from seminars from conference
1:32 like this
1:33 like what we are doing right now or from
1:35 other mentors or reading books
1:36 and i found it very fascinating so this
1:38 is how i started
1:40 on my material science journey and then
1:43 i moved on to my first full-time role
1:45 as a data scientist in turn i didn't
1:48 start off as a full-timer yet
1:49 because i i just wanted to get more
1:52 experience you know
1:53 to build my portfolio before i started
1:55 working on a full-time
1:56 basis so i worked on a few months for
1:59 internship and then started on moving my
2:01 full-time role as cetera scientist and
2:03 until now i joined
2:04 hey wagon as a full-time data science
2:06 instructor hope
2:08 to you know share what i've learned so
2:10 far with people who
2:11 want to learn data science but somehow
2:13 they are not sure how to start
2:15 you know or begin that journey yeah
2:18 okay uh yeah that's uh
2:22 um and i guess uh like
2:26 that that is uh how to put it uh
2:30 like helping people to start this is uh
2:32 like an amazing and this is like pretty
2:34 on topic for what
2:35 we discussed today right so like uh
2:38 um yeah so maybe we will start let's
2:41 start with that
2:42 um so what is personal brand for you
2:44 what does it mean
2:45 for you i see i think this is a very
2:49 broad definition
2:50 here but to me personal brand is really
2:52 just more than you know getting
2:54 followers i think this is some
2:56 vanity metrics that uh the last thing
2:58 they want to do right when you start
3:00 building your personal brand but to me
3:02 really it really boils down to
3:04 uh sharing your expertise as i said your
3:06 experience your knowledge or even your
3:08 mistakes
3:09 along the journey uh in your career so
3:12 that you can help more people
3:13 and at the same time the byproduct of
3:15 doing this is that
3:16 you starting building your own online
3:18 presence that people start to know you
3:20 so for example if you go to linkedin um
3:23 you might not know or even aware of that
3:25 that some recruiters or employers
3:28 are from other companies or people who
3:30 are hiring they may notice your profile
3:32 so this is how you start building your
3:34 personal brand getting people to notice
3:36 while at the same time you are sharing
3:38 what it is that you love to help people
3:41 and i think throughout this so-called
3:43 personal brand journey
3:45 this is you know the most fulfilling
3:47 things i've ever done
3:49 throughout my career yeah so
3:52 in your opinion this is like the most uh
3:56 like the one of the obligations like
3:59 how to say like with personal brand you
4:01 become more visible
4:03 on social media right and the reason you
4:05 might do this as i understood like let's
4:07 say when you
4:08 are looking for a job and you want to
4:10 get noticed right and this is
4:12 how people uh get start with their own
4:16 own personal brand
4:17 so they want to get noticed so they
4:19 start being active on social media and
4:20 then hiring managers see them
4:22 uh reach out or maybe when you apply for
4:26 a job
4:27 they say okay i must have seen this
4:29 person in social media and then they
4:31 immediately get privatized
4:32 is it like that exactly and this is
4:36 to me one of the most effective ways to
4:38 differentiate yourself as a candidate
4:40 when it comes to job searching you can
4:42 imagine if you just like other people
4:44 just submit your resume to hundreds of
4:46 other resumes out there it is very hard
4:48 to
4:48 differentiate yourself so if you have a
4:50 strong personal brand that really
4:52 tells a lot yeah
4:55 and is it a synonym for uh online
4:58 presence like a strong personal brand
5:00 like being active on social media or
5:02 there is something more to that i would
5:05 say online or offline
5:06 how you are perceived online is how you
5:08 are perceived offline
5:10 so this is how people uh notice you i
5:12 mean first impression matters right how
5:14 people
5:14 perceive you online to bring it to
5:16 offline and when they meet you
5:18 your impression will still be there this
5:20 is how we'll see
5:21 and um so i think this is both kind of
5:24 channels for personal brand
5:26 and we need to do it consistently so
5:28 it's not like
5:29 you just share your stuff once in a
5:32 month or once in a week
5:33 but you have to do it consistently long
5:35 time uh so i will always tell people
5:37 that within your presented brand is not
5:39 like a one-time goal but more on
5:41 it is a consistent uh commitment right
5:44 that you need to do
5:46 and to share so that you as a person as
5:48 an individual your presence
5:50 is always on top of other people's mind
5:52 so when they have some opportunities
5:54 immediately they will think of you and
5:57 they will contact you and this is how
5:58 you
5:59 get more opportunities and we all know
6:01 that getting more opportunities
6:03 meaning that we can get a better chance
6:06 to go to a next level in our career
6:09 so it means you need to be like i don't
6:11 know if i can say it
6:12 like be famous in certain area when they
6:16 think okay
6:17 who are people in singapore who are good
6:19 at teaching data science
6:21 they immediately think of you right so
6:22 this is a sort of a personal brand right
6:24 so being
6:26 sort of famous in a certain niche or am
6:28 i correct
6:30 i maybe i will try to rephrase it
6:32 instead of being famous i would say
6:34 to be known to know yes to be known as
6:37 someone that is established
6:39 in their own expertise yes uh
6:43 yeah so this is how we define that and
6:46 how do we establish this expertise
6:49 yeah good questions i think everyone has
6:52 their own preference so be it
6:53 writing articles or medium uh right or
6:56 be
6:57 using a podcast if you like uh to
7:00 present using your voice or be it a
7:02 video if you like a visual kind of
7:04 sharing
7:04 so everyone has different preference so
7:06 to me i prefer
7:08 writing and face-to-face sharing
7:11 and that's the reason why i become a
7:13 data science instructor because i like
7:15 to share
7:16 face to face online or offline so if you
7:18 have noticed i also
7:20 share quite a bit of data science
7:22 articles on medium
7:24 and i think one of the main reasons is
7:26 that i love writing like a lot
7:28 i love sharing my thoughts on writing i
7:30 i i see that you know whenever i write
7:33 it really helps me think deeper of what
7:35 i understand
7:37 certain knowledge that helps me reflect
7:41 on a lot of things on myself to deepen
7:43 my knowledge
7:44 and at the same time i can share with
7:46 others to help others
7:47 so to me i think that depends on what
7:50 channel you
7:51 prefer and you can go for it yeah
7:54 so for you you mentioned it was medium
7:56 right so you started
7:58 posting something actively on medium and
8:00 this is how people noticed you right
8:03 exactly exactly exactly can you tell us
8:06 that story like how did it happen for
8:08 you
8:08 yeah great uh this is interesting back
8:11 two years back
8:13 when i started my data science journey
8:14 because i just wanted to share my
8:17 data science journey and back then i
8:19 didn't know about this thing called
8:21 personal brands so i just share for the
8:22 sake of
8:23 helping and sharing and the moment i
8:25 started directing
8:27 uh for a publication called tourist data
8:30 science
8:31 and my details got published and i got
8:34 a bit of comments and remarks you know
8:37 on other people
8:38 and at that time i knew that i was onto
8:41 something
8:43 in the writing space because i mean i
8:45 love writing and people really resonated
8:47 a lot
8:48 with my writing and data science and
8:50 that's when i started
8:51 you know continue writing not every day
8:55 but
8:56 on a weekly basis i make a strong
8:59 commitment to myself
9:00 whatever that happened i got to write an
9:03 article
9:04 every week right every week consistently
9:08 for a few months so that was how i built
9:11 out my momentum
9:12 uh you couldn't just write an article
9:15 like once
9:16 in a blue moon and you just leave it
9:19 there
9:19 to build your your establish yourself as
9:23 expectation this year i think
9:24 consistency plays black role yeah
9:28 okay so you uh you decided that you want
9:31 to share the knowledge
9:32 so and i can guess why like uh i like
9:36 writing because
9:37 it helps me learn things better and i
9:39 think you also mentioned that
9:40 this was the reason for you as well so
9:42 you did that
9:44 for a couple of months and this helped
9:46 like it resonated with people right they
9:48 started replying in comments and it's
9:49 okay
9:50 like i must be on something right
9:53 yes exactly yeah and that was how i got
9:56 into
9:57 other different publications uh
10:00 one and the other and that was how my
10:04 piece of writings got republished and
10:07 other platforms to help more people
10:09 and reach a wider audience and i think
10:11 that helps
10:12 using different publications so that it
10:15 can help
10:15 right make your audience wider yeah
10:19 and what was uh like i know when you
10:22 publish and publish something for
10:24 a couple of months um probably most of
10:27 things they do not get
10:29 they are not noticed they do not get
10:30 traction uh
10:32 but like at some point it starts getting
10:34 action so how do you
10:36 how do you convince yourself that you
10:38 must keep going you must keep writing if
10:42 i don't know like you publish something
10:45 and then two
10:46 three people see this no no one reacts
10:48 like how do you
10:49 convince yourself that this is worth
10:51 doing
10:53 yeah this is very true because sometimes
10:55 when you didn't get an attraction
10:57 you doubted yourself right should i
10:59 continue or not right this kind of
11:00 mindset so to me one of the things that
11:03 really kept me moving
11:04 is that first of all you you really need
11:07 to have
11:08 the passion of what you do so i love
11:10 writing so
11:11 so this is one thing one reason our
11:14 second reason is that
11:15 um because i got a lot of
11:20 messages mainly from linkedin people who
11:23 read my articles they told me that hey i
11:25 found your ticket helpful
11:26 really thanks for you writing that that
11:28 helps me a lot in my journey
11:29 that messages alone really kept me
11:32 going because i knew that even just one
11:35 person who read
11:36 the article i knew that i helped someone
11:38 so it doesn't matter how many people
11:40 that i
11:40 i reach out that's what kept me going um
11:43 even before i got any traction
11:45 during the early days so so i think
11:47 these are the two main things
11:49 yeah that can be great and you also
11:51 mentioned
11:52 you were writing for towards data
11:53 science and i guess
11:55 this is like a sort of
11:58 how to call like a publisher uh who
12:01 already has an audience right so you're
12:02 kinda
12:04 uh building on top of the audience they
12:06 have so it's not like you're
12:08 writing to like and know what it sees
12:11 right so
12:12 there's already certain audience there
12:14 right
12:15 exactly we always want to leverage
12:18 the existing audience size from the
12:21 publications
12:23 because you just publish it on your own
12:25 it's very hard to get noticed
12:27 even by the medium editors or other
12:29 publication
12:30 so to me getting into tourist data
12:34 science
12:35 is the best decision to start
12:38 for me yeah yeah and uh well i
12:41 personally know you from linkedin so
12:43 this is where i saw you
12:46 and not on i'm not very active on medium
12:48 i sometimes of course stumble across
12:52 in linkedin or in twitter i stumble
12:53 across posts that lead to medium but
12:55 typically this is not something i
12:59 read on a daily basis so how this
13:01 transition for you happen from
13:03 being known on medium to be known on
13:06 social media
13:08 cool good question i think
13:11 i actually did this at the same time so
13:15 so back then when i was deciding you
13:17 know which social media should i focus
13:19 on i i couldn't be
13:20 everywhere because there's only one land
13:22 here um so
13:24 i decided that i got to focus on two
13:25 things first medium
13:27 second lengthy so i put all my time all
13:30 my efforts in these two channels
13:32 i have that so so i started writing my
13:34 articles every week
13:36 this is this is one thing second thing
13:38 is i decided to make a commitment to
13:41 post my content on linkedin every
13:45 one or two days so one week i should
13:47 post maybe
13:48 three to four posts on linkedin
13:51 uh by sharing my experience or maybe a
13:54 snippet
13:55 of my articles or maybe just to share my
13:57 articles that i've written
13:58 on linkedin but there was a um
14:01 [Music]
14:03 a very i would say a struggling process
14:07 especially on lengthy it's not like
14:09 medium is it's an entirely different
14:11 ecosystem
14:12 so to me uh to really get
14:15 traction in in any channel
14:18 i would really need to understand how
14:20 their ecosystem works
14:21 because every channel has their own
14:23 audience based on their space
14:25 and different audience prefers different
14:28 formats
14:28 for example medium is a long formatting
14:30 content written content right
14:33 but from a linkedin there's a word limit
14:35 so i got to
14:36 write an engaging story within that 1
14:40 300 characters if you know i mean
14:43 the key people are really understand
14:46 that
14:46 follow the story and at the end of the
14:48 story they need to
14:49 have some take away lesson learned from
14:51 this from the post
14:53 and and i can tell you to generate
14:55 content
14:57 is one of the toughest things ever
15:01 i think you know that yeah yes so it's
15:03 very tough
15:04 yes yeah yeah so
15:08 you started writing on medium and at the
15:11 same time you started writing on
15:13 linkedin
15:13 at the same time right correct yeah
15:15 because i got an impression first that
15:17 you were writing something on medium and
15:18 then you would just
15:19 post the articles and i know that if you
15:22 do that
15:23 linkedin doesn't like when you share
15:28 links right so like when i share a link
15:30 it gets
15:31 very few use when i share like a story
15:34 it gets a lot more engagement so
15:36 linkedin doesn't like links and i was
15:38 going to ask you like how did you
15:40 overcome that but i i understood that
15:43 you were also in addition to just
15:45 sharing
15:45 sharing links you were also sharing your
15:47 personal stories
15:48 just on linkedin right exactly sometimes
15:52 it could be different format of content
15:54 uh beyond just the articles itself
15:57 i also share like like you say uh the
15:59 the personal journey is
16:01 nothing that is related to data science
16:03 because something that's personal right
16:05 so it's inspiring that i find it
16:07 inspiring i want to share with others
16:10 also you could share a bit of your data
16:11 science stuff that i share
16:14 sometimes just something random or funny
16:17 that i found it right
16:19 so i think in terms of
16:22 giving content to help other people it
16:24 doesn't really need to be always related
16:26 to
16:27 what you do it could be something
16:29 personal something career
16:31 related something inspiring something
16:33 sad sometimes
16:35 something that you know you can just
16:37 share some quotes
16:38 to motivate others you will know because
16:41 somebody who is having a heart day they
16:43 read your stuff
16:44 and they find it helpful and this is the
16:46 impact and i love that
16:48 yeah yeah yes i
16:51 can totally relate to that but i i'm
16:54 also curious to know like
16:55 um because you said that people don't
16:58 usually do this for the sake of personal
17:00 brand and you
17:00 didn't even know that there is a word
17:03 that there is a like a term like that
17:04 personal brand
17:05 so just uh did you just wake up one day
17:10 and realized okay i want to share
17:12 on linkedin and twitter or not sorry on
17:15 linkedin and medium
17:16 or how did it happen like how did you
17:18 think okay i need to share and i need to
17:20 be consistent and i need to post
17:22 once per week on medium and three four
17:24 times per week on linkedin
17:26 like how did this process happen to you
17:29 like what led you to this decision
17:32 yeah great question in fact before i
17:34 started sharing any content on any
17:36 channel
17:38 i was following a lot of other
17:41 so-called data science mentors that was
17:43 way before two years back
17:46 and they share a lot of content and
17:49 that time i just started joining and
17:51 being active on linkedin
17:52 i didn't post anything i just read what
17:55 whatever they post on linkedin like the
17:57 content
17:58 and i really found it very helpful all
17:59 the stuff i would say
18:01 70 to 80 percent of data science
18:03 knowledge that i learned
18:05 not from the book but from linkedin to
18:07 be honest
18:08 and that's that's when i realized
18:10 linkedin is just not
18:12 it's not just a job search platform i
18:14 think it's much more than that
18:15 it's even beyond what people would think
18:17 hey i just throw my resume on linkedin
18:19 to find a job
18:21 and this is not what i thought back then
18:23 and i think that linkedin is a perfect
18:26 platform to network to learn from each
18:28 other to share what you have
18:30 and and this is why i love linkedin and
18:33 i started sharing more of the content
18:35 instead of being a consumer
18:37 on linkedin i want to be a producer to
18:39 help other people
18:40 create on linkedin okay
18:44 so so that was how i started being
18:46 active on linkedin
18:47 and and i realized that the data science
18:50 community on linkedin is super helpful
18:53 you can just ask the question should i
18:54 learn
19:03 you would probably trigger a wall right
19:06 because
19:07 you can see how how passionate people
19:10 are right
19:10 on linkedin in data science space and
19:12 that's why i love that
19:14 and i love to share
19:17 yes yeah i remember for me it happened
19:20 like i just
19:21 one day i gave a talk or something like
19:23 that and i shared the presentation
19:25 slides on linkedin and it just
19:28 went crazy like i don't know like to me
19:31 crazy it was like 15 likes or something
19:34 yeah and then this is then i understood
19:36 okay like
19:37 there is something to that like maybe if
19:39 i next time i give a talk i again share
19:42 something or i write a post
19:44 and then like people started to react
19:46 and i saw like
19:47 engagement and this uh you know got me
19:50 hooked
19:50 was it similar to you yeah i think i
19:53 think
19:54 you mentioned it correctly like uh
19:57 it's not like every pose would go viral
19:59 right the moment you started noticing
20:01 certain traction for example your case
20:04 50 likes i didn't realize oh maybe you
20:06 know i should post more useful content
20:08 and
20:08 that will engage other people and people
20:11 find it helpful
20:12 and it's how i felt that sometimes when
20:14 i post i
20:15 felt did i really add any values i
20:18 doubted myself right every post
20:20 but then when i realized of my post
20:22 really got a lot of engagement you know
20:23 people commenting down there
20:25 and sharing with me that they found it
20:27 helpful that really motivated me a lot
20:30 so so that's how i i felt and got
20:33 started and really
20:35 post content consistently on linkedin
20:37 even now
20:38 nowadays to to share that i make a
20:42 make up my mind to share content at
20:45 least
20:45 three to four times a week on lengthy
20:49 maybe not so uh frequent on medium
20:53 nowadays as i don't write on medium
20:55 numbers because of my work commitment
20:56 but linkedin
20:58 is still my favorite channel yes
21:01 and i imagine that writing a full post
21:03 medium just simply takes more time
21:06 right and i think then you can just
21:08 quickly draft something and then see
21:10 if the idea uh resonates with people and
21:12 then converts it to an article
21:15 yeah correct yeah exactly did you do
21:17 that all right yes
21:18 i i actually how i put up content for me
21:22 is uh i'm sure you heard of that it's
21:24 called hootsuite it's a platform for
21:26 people to write
21:27 to schedule their content so to me i
21:30 don't really prefer
21:32 writing a post every single day because
21:35 that is
21:36 very time consuming i would just chunk
21:39 up
21:40 maybe one or two hours time on weekend
21:43 and within these two hours i'm gonna
21:44 generate all the ideas that i have
21:47 to make it a bite size content that i
21:49 can share maybe linkedin or twitter
21:52 and just schedule it right away
21:54 throughout the next week
21:55 so this week i'm gonna generate some
21:58 contents and schedule it to be out
21:59 next week so this is my workflow
22:03 but this also saved me a lot of time to
22:05 make it much more productive
22:07 because if you imagine every day after
22:09 work evening
22:10 sitting at home and you're going to
22:12 control continuing to book out
22:14 you spend like half an hour there one
22:16 week you spend more than that so
22:18 to me productivity is quite
22:21 important and
22:24 yeah i'm really curious about this like
22:27 you
22:27 you said that once a week you sit down
22:30 for one two hours and then you generate
22:32 as many ideas as possible
22:34 so how does the process of generating
22:36 ideas look to you like where do you get
22:38 inspiration
22:40 good question very good i think that's
22:42 very tough right content generation is
22:44 not easy
22:45 i always have some resources that refer
22:49 to
22:50 for example you can look at feedly
22:54 i'm actually hold up there fiddly fdly
22:57 is a super cool data aggregator platform
23:01 and it's free
23:02 it aggregates all the platforms they've
23:04 selected
23:06 for you every single day and if you are
23:09 wondering what content to post
23:10 you can refer to that and see what
23:12 articles that pick your interests
23:14 you read the article if you find it
23:15 helpful and you can regenerate your
23:17 content right away and you can just
23:19 write your thoughts about the article
23:21 what you see there what do you think
23:23 about this article
23:24 and this one way another way something
23:27 that is rather
23:28 technical is true basumo
23:31 what's up
23:36 s-u-m-o but sumo
23:39 uh and usually bazumo features the top
23:42 content
23:43 in the entire internet for some topics
23:46 so you
23:46 if you're wondering what topics that
23:48 garner the interest in the internet
23:50 right now
23:51 that people click on it a lot of sharing
23:53 you know engagement
23:55 you can read the topic correct training
23:57 stuff on twitter for example right
23:59 you can read that and from there maybe
24:02 you can get some
24:03 ideas of what content you post for
24:06 example on basketball if i see
24:08 how to go into data science so that
24:10 means people are very curious and
24:12 interested in
24:13 going to data science so i might write a
24:16 post to give people
24:17 seven steps on how to raise their sights
24:20 and that will increase the chance of
24:22 getting more people interest
24:25 yeah so there are definitely different
24:27 ways of doing that
24:28 another personal preference is whenever
24:31 i
24:32 have any ideas like randomly i was i'm
24:36 working i'm working i have some ideas
24:39 i can't memorize all these so i have my
24:42 super
24:42 productivity apps it's called evernote
24:47 notes okay i share that remember notes
24:49 okay
24:50 notes yes i just jot down my
24:53 thoughts on evernote like what i'm gonna
24:55 share just a topic you don't need to
24:57 write all things
24:58 because i'm going to write this on
24:59 sunday anyway so i just like the topic
25:01 where i'm going to share
25:03 and i just compile them and i write that
25:06 on sunday itself another
25:09 channel that you can get your
25:11 inspiration is by looking at other
25:13 people's contents
25:15 you can see that easily right yeah in
25:16 data science community if you notice
25:19 some posts really get a bit of
25:21 engagement
25:22 compared to others and then i would see
25:25 hey what exactly
25:27 that move people from this post what are
25:30 the inspiration
25:31 and what's the format of the content is
25:33 there a video based is there written
25:34 content
25:35 or is it an audiobase sometimes it could
25:37 be a pdf i tested one time
25:39 i posted a pdf cheat sheet on linkedin
25:44 that's gone crazy wow right so
25:48 so it's all about experimentation and
25:50 sharing and once you notice that pattern
25:53 all right focus on that yeah but
25:56 linkedin's
25:57 algorithm always changes i would say the
26:00 most important thing
26:02 is your quality of your content
26:06 so make sure that your content is is
26:08 good that can add value to other people
26:10 instead of copy pasting other people i
26:12 think it's not good
26:14 yeah okay and we have ravit here in the
26:17 comments
26:18 and he is he uses this pdf
26:22 format quite a while quite quite a lot
26:24 like like he's sharing cheat sheets and
26:26 his posts
26:27 get a lot of engagement so hi review
26:29 thanks for for dropping by
26:31 um what do you think about other
26:34 platforms so linkedin is not the only
26:36 platform so there are also um other
26:39 things like credit
26:40 core twitter uh like i don't know you
26:44 name it there are
26:45 quite a few of them so what do you think
26:46 about other platforms
26:48 yeah you're right actually there are so
26:50 many other platforms out there
26:52 and um i would love to try out
26:55 clubhouse some days of course okay
26:58 yes when i get an iphone but i'm
27:00 currently using android and that's fine
27:02 all right so clubhouse is my goal my
27:05 future
27:06 platform that i'm going to trial but in
27:08 fact the current platform that i'm
27:09 trying out right now is twitter
27:12 i'm actually recently moving more
27:15 towards the twitter parts
27:17 because i find there's opportunity there
27:21 that we can share our content as well
27:24 but i realized that twitter is kind of a
27:26 huge different
27:28 ecosystem compared to linkedin and it's
27:30 very crowded right
27:31 crowded very crowded and somehow noisy
27:34 and you couldn't write
27:35 a long-form story that i'm so used to on
27:38 linkedin
27:39 so every time when i want to share
27:40 something i need to really restrict my
27:41 word counts or i just keep it into
27:43 multiple threads
27:46 yes and yeah to this one one channel the
27:49 other one that i would love to try out
27:51 some days
27:51 is quora as you said it's a q a platform
27:54 quora or even stack overflow for people
27:57 who are
27:58 technical to answer some other other
28:02 technical questions so i would suggest
28:03 that yeah
28:06 yes yeah this question answering
28:09 platforms they're quite interesting
28:10 because usually like you said
28:12 you started in this you didn't know
28:14 about personal brand you just wanted to
28:15 share
28:16 knowledge right and i think this these
28:18 platforms like stock exchange platforms
28:21 like quora
28:22 even reddit they're really good
28:24 platforms for exactly that
28:26 right for sharing knowledge answering
28:28 questions
28:30 yeah correct and people can upvote your
28:33 answers
28:34 if your answers are really helpful and
28:36 adding a lot of values people are voted
28:38 and you gain more visibility
28:40 and moving onwards
28:44 you will then build your portfolio on
28:45 portfolio uh
28:47 or quora itself yeah yeah
28:50 one trick i used like i used to be
28:53 active on quora
28:54 and it's interesting like it gives a lot
28:56 of inspiration like when you
28:58 get a question on quora and okay this is
29:00 what people
29:02 are interested about okay this is
29:04 something i can
29:05 uh you know answer this question and put
29:07 it on linkedin or on twitter
29:09 and then yeah it also resonates with
29:12 people so this is a
29:13 a nice trick maybe for you or for for
29:16 who is listening to try
29:17 to be helpful in quora and then
29:19 repurpose this content on
29:21 other social media platforms oh great
29:24 yeah yeah i'll try it out yeah
29:26 soon maybe
29:31 so you mentioned clubhouse uh which is
29:33 an
29:34 ideal only thing i haven't tried it
29:35 because i also have an android
29:37 so this is very like not inclusive
29:40 platform right
29:41 like us it's
29:44 it's audio only thing and podcasts are
29:48 also audio only
29:49 right so all sometimes now podcasts are
29:52 with video like this one we have right
29:54 now it's on youtube
29:56 but we will also release it as audio
29:58 only version so what is your opinion on
30:00 podcasts what do you think about it see
30:03 i think i myself i've been wanting to
30:06 travel podcasts
30:07 since last year but i didn't get the
30:09 time to really commit myself to do it
30:11 because that requires
30:13 way more time than just writing your
30:14 content but to me
30:16 based on what i've heard and seen an
30:18 experience i think podcast is a great
30:20 way to share your content
30:22 in that like if you you can have 15
30:25 minutes
30:25 half an hour one hour podcast with
30:27 someone
30:29 with one guest a few guests discussing
30:31 certain topics
30:32 and you guys can just share your
30:34 opinions or perspective in these topics
30:36 right
30:36 and that really helps a lot for other
30:39 audience to learn
30:40 from from all the sharing itself instead
30:43 of just
30:44 you writing the article sharing your
30:45 opinion sometimes when people listen to
30:48 different opinions they may form their
30:49 own perspective and that i think will be
30:52 something that's helpful for others
30:55 so basically when it's a discussion
30:57 rather than you know just one person
30:58 talking or just one person
31:00 uh writing when there is a discussion it
31:03 can be more
31:03 entertaining and more like how to say
31:06 more exploratory like you can explore
31:08 one topic by just
31:09 you know exchanging opinion and then
31:11 talking about this
31:13 yeah exactly and it's a good way to
31:15 network with others
31:19 so is it a good thing for establishing a
31:22 personal brand
31:23 like being on a podcast let's say as a
31:26 guest or even as a host
31:28 what i would say is definitely a huge
31:30 opportunity you can see
31:31 right now on linkedin so many people are
31:34 pushing out
31:35 written form content let's focus on the
31:37 data science domain right
31:39 you can see a lot of written content
31:41 sharing their content and linking
31:43 step by step with some sort of the post
31:46 but
31:47 you it's highly uh unlikely that you'll
31:51 see
31:51 someone sharing on podcasts about data
31:54 science
31:54 in them unless there are some
31:56 celebrities podcasts but
31:58 usually i think people just share it you
32:00 know either on articles
32:02 or youtube videos right so i think
32:05 podcast is another domain
32:06 that if you want to build a personal
32:08 brand and audio
32:09 is your strengths by all means go for it
32:12 because i think there's a huge
32:14 opportunity there to build your personal
32:16 brand
32:17 i like the place where people are not in
32:19 there
32:20 and you go in you build your expertise
32:23 your domain
32:24 your personal brand and this is how you
32:27 get an early
32:28 early game uh opportunity
32:31 yeah yeah but it's also a bit
32:33 challenging
32:34 uh because when you have video or when
32:37 you write
32:38 you can really use all these tools that
32:40 are available for you like diagrams
32:42 visuals like you can really explain like
32:44 especially in data science when we have
32:46 a lot of formulas a lot of code
32:48 it's very challenging to do that in
32:50 audio only format right without any
32:52 slides without uh
32:54 text so you really have to be good at
32:56 explaining things
32:58 yeah and that trends your uh
33:00 communication skills
33:02 and one of the good things about
33:03 podcasts or videos is that i think
33:06 when you have a podcast someone you can
33:08 actually redistribute
33:09 your content in different formats let's
33:12 say
33:13 today me and you we're having a podcast
33:16 and there's a camera recording us
33:18 so that could be a video visual podcast
33:20 and we can transcribe it into a written
33:22 format sharing a medium so this one and
33:25 you can also share the podcast
33:27 snippets of the podcast like maybe one
33:30 minute
33:31 on instagram on linkedin on facebook on
33:35 twitter
33:36 so if you have one hour long of podcasts
33:37 you can actually split this one hour
33:39 podcast into 10
33:40 different content right so i think this
33:44 is something that i learned from
33:45 gary vaynerchuk you talk about this yeah
33:49 okay i uh i know he's famous i just uh
33:54 i haven't really followed him
33:57 but yeah i i know so many people
33:59 actually mentioned him that
34:01 like this is where they get exp got
34:04 inspiration to the active on
34:06 social media and yeah what do you think
34:09 about
34:10 so we've mostly talked about online
34:12 stuff being there on linkedin
34:14 being there on uh medium also podcast
34:17 this is something also that is
34:19 more typical for online than offline so
34:22 what
34:22 what about offline world so how um
34:26 well like right now it's of course
34:29 difficult with a lockdown situation
34:31 uh but i know in singapore maybe it's
34:33 less
34:34 less strong like the like all the
34:37 restrictions
34:39 um so how can we become more
34:42 visible outside of internet like outside
34:44 of linkedin outside of medium
34:46 what is your opinion now um i think
34:50 because of kobe we can't really go out
34:52 to meet new people every day
34:54 um but let's assume kobe is not here yes
34:58 let's assume and and i think
35:01 one of the platforms that i would use of
35:04 course is linkedin
35:05 uh how i would usually bring my online
35:08 connection to offline
35:09 is through mainly linkedin we have been
35:12 known each other on linkedin
35:13 maybe commenting on each other's posts
35:15 but we really didn't
35:17 come out and meet because i'm in
35:19 singapore usually
35:20 uh when i come out and meet someone i
35:22 try to say hey you know
35:23 um i would love to have a ketchup you
35:25 have time for a little ketchup
35:28 in singapore somewhere uh cafe right
35:31 so this one one way another way is
35:34 through
35:35 meetups i attended a lot of meetups in
35:37 singapore
35:38 offline meetups so in google they often
35:41 organize their monthly meetups
35:43 so from there i knew a lot of people and
35:45 we got to know each other better
35:47 and also it is one way for me to got to
35:48 know the industry
35:51 better like what's going on right now
35:54 now the other
35:55 platform that i use which is not very
35:58 popular in singapore yet
36:00 it's called lunch
36:03 lunch club lunch club have you thought
36:05 of that yeah i could yes i did
36:07 okay yeah i recently just joined lunch
36:09 club and it's fantastic because
36:13 i didn't really come out and meet people
36:16 uh but usually we meet online on zoo
36:18 or google meet and i got to know a lot
36:21 of people
36:22 in different industries someone from
36:25 lawyer as a lawyer
36:26 someone as a designer someone's an
36:28 entrepreneur
36:30 and someone from who is a still student
36:33 so from there i learned a lot not just
36:35 in data science and that really broadens
36:36 my perspective to learn from others and
36:39 who knows maybe in the future
36:41 you guys may have other business
36:43 opportunities
36:44 to collect right so lunch club i think
36:47 is uh
36:48 one of the most underrated platforms but
36:50 that requires
36:51 invitation you might yeah right like
36:54 clubhouse right
36:56 yes yes so this
36:59 is good these are the few ways that i
37:01 try
37:02 to bring online to offline not all of
37:05 the online connections but maybe
37:06 somebody who you have known for some
37:09 time
37:09 and you're just going to catch up and
37:11 understand why each other
37:13 yes and it's basically it makes so the
37:16 connections we have on linkedin they are
37:18 rather shallow connections right
37:19 so we maybe comment on each other posts
37:21 or write something
37:22 but like the moment when you meet a
37:24 person then this week connection becomes
37:26 a strong connection
37:28 right and then uh like uh usually it's
37:30 better
37:31 like for it's like for networking for
37:34 job opportunities or for things like
37:36 that right
37:38 yes and and i would recommend that in
37:40 the beginning when
37:42 someone when a person is starting out to
37:44 feel he or she's a three personal brand
37:48 if someone invites you out
37:51 like for offline catch up
37:54 please don't say no always say yes you
37:57 won't know
37:58 what comes next a lot of times i hear
38:01 um you know i don't have time i have
38:03 some stuff to do i don't know this guy
38:04 or girl i just don't
38:06 i don't feel like going out uh just say
38:08 yes
38:09 say yes to that go for it just try and
38:12 and you will know right because a lot of
38:14 cool opportunities
38:15 come when you meet someone new to me
38:19 i would say my experience is that all of
38:22 the
38:23 amazing opportunities that come along my
38:25 way come from people whom i knew
38:28 of life yeah that i brought it from
38:33 yeah i'm curious like uh for people who
38:37 are not extroverted like who would
38:39 rather not
38:40 meet people and sit you know in front of
38:42 a computer and
38:44 talk uh or maybe like only like talk
38:47 with close
38:48 uh friends uh you know what i'm talking
38:50 about
38:51 like how they can
38:55 and i know that i'm also that person
38:57 like
38:58 at least it was like for me it was very
39:00 difficult to
39:01 to talk to people like and when somebody
39:04 invites me on
39:04 101 in a cafe somewhere in the city i
39:07 thought okay like
39:08 what does this person need from me like
39:11 is it even safe to go there like and
39:13 what what if like
39:14 and i immediately imagine the situation
39:16 like okay we'll just be sitting
39:18 drinking coffee and not talking you know
39:20 like this awkward situation when there
39:21 is not nothing to talk about
39:23 and then uh like i don't know after 10
39:25 minutes okay i need to go something like
39:27 that
39:28 yeah like how to overcome because i know
39:31 when i
39:32 eventually agreed to meet with somebody
39:35 this awkward situation didn't happen and
39:37 what happened was amazing right so i got
39:39 to know
39:41 new people i got good connections
39:45 like how to overcome this barrier how to
39:47 say yes
39:50 let's see i think i feel you because
39:53 there are always some awkward moments
39:55 you can't really talk for non-stop
39:57 like one hour two hours there's always
39:59 some sort of
40:00 silence and people by nature hate
40:03 silence
40:04 when they are in there with other people
40:07 so to me
40:08 i would say maybe two things here uh one
40:11 thing
40:12 this just based on my experience is that
40:14 um
40:14 [Music]
40:16 being vulnerable as you are
40:19 if i just meet someone i wouldn't mind
40:22 sharing
40:22 some of my weaknesses to them you know i
40:26 just shared i really don't know this and
40:28 by
40:29 admitting i don't know this people are
40:31 more open enough to share what they know
40:33 to help you
40:34 and people by nature are always willing
40:37 to help
40:38 you just need to give a chance for them
40:39 to help you and
40:41 how to give a chance is by being
40:42 vulnerable
40:44 and this is how we connect easily by
40:47 opening up our
40:48 door but the first step is to open your
40:50 door first
40:52 so being vulnerable is one thing uh
40:54 second thing
40:55 is try to think some of the common
40:59 topics that
41:00 we can relate to for example if i am if
41:03 i'm meeting someone
41:04 at a cafe i i i would maybe talk about
41:07 some of the recent news
41:08 perhaps kobe perhaps clubhouse that hey
41:11 you play cup house
41:13 yeah i do i'm using android can you you
41:15 shave yourself your clubhouse experience
41:17 now this is another new topic right
41:19 something that the person is interested
41:21 in and you are curious to know
41:23 so there is a exchange of information
41:25 there and i find it very interesting
41:27 yeah okay
41:31 but there is not like it's not just
41:33 about one-on-one meetings
41:35 in the offline world so we can also go
41:37 to meetups
41:38 not just as visitors not just as guests
41:41 but also as speakers
41:42 and if we talk about personal brand then
41:44 this is maybe
41:45 a more scalable way of establishing
41:48 offline personal brand offline presence
41:51 right
41:53 so how do you how can one get
41:56 invited to meet up to speak or how can
41:59 one
42:00 try to to get to speak on the meet up
42:05 hi i see good question um i still
42:07 remember the first time i got
42:09 invited to to a meet up
42:13 it was in a bank i wouldn't imagine i
42:16 would go in and just talk
42:17 and what really scared me the most is in
42:20 the meetup
42:21 most of the people were from a big
42:22 company
42:24 and i was speaking side by side with
42:28 another cto of that big company
42:32 and i was like oh my god that i was i
42:34 was not the first speaker i was the
42:35 second one
42:36 so the first biggest pokemon i was like
42:37 oh my god i'm not gonna share what i'm
42:39 gonna share these people are gonna
42:40 listen to me
42:41 so this is something that i uh i was
42:44 fortunate to join
42:45 but i think to me the first time going
42:48 back there is because
42:50 i knew the person um through linkedin
42:54 again i brought this connection of life
42:56 that we've met
42:58 over a few times we got to know each
43:00 other better maybe through some
43:01 collaboration
43:02 and the people know you better and
43:04 people will start you know noticing
43:06 you're inviting you when they leave
43:08 a speaker so it is more on a
43:11 passive way you're waiting someone to
43:13 approach you
43:14 a more active way that i would say is
43:17 try to look out for
43:20 other conferences and i think current
43:22 currently
43:23 due to kobe situation there are many
43:25 virtual conferences that you can go
43:27 so you can just google search for data
43:30 science conferences like
43:32 uh data talk like today conference or
43:35 maybe
43:35 uh whether you have different data
43:38 conferences like beta catered
43:40 by kids right so different different
43:43 conferences they
43:44 they also need speakers you just need to
43:47 try to
43:48 ask hey you know i have this expertise
43:51 and i really love to share
43:53 this topic stuff like that to add more
43:56 values to your audience still mind
43:58 that you have any other vacancy for that
44:01 and i think people will be more than
44:03 willing to give you a chance if you're
44:05 just
44:05 us mm-hmm
44:08 but also like speaking of uh dedicated
44:12 conference i also approached kate saying
44:14 hey can i
44:15 speak at your conference and then no
44:18 so oh because it was already booked so i
44:21 couldn't speak
44:22 but like how uh like when you ask people
44:25 hey hey can i speak on
44:26 also in many conferences there is a
44:28 certain process like you need to
44:30 submit proposal and then they review the
44:32 proposal and get
44:33 back to you and then often you get
44:36 rejected
44:37 like how how to deal with this rejection
44:39 like when uh you want to talk about
44:41 something you want to teach people but
44:42 they said no
44:43 like this this doesn't belong here like
44:45 or we already booked like how
44:48 how to deal with this rejection see i
44:51 think that's
44:52 uh understandable so for me usually i
44:56 would just
44:57 of course getting rejected is sad to be
45:00 honest
45:00 but other than that i would say i will
45:03 try to get that feedback like
45:05 uh why is your concern is it because
45:08 it's already full
45:09 or is it because of some mismatch in
45:12 terms of expectation
45:13 or maybe this doesn't fix your your
45:15 conference team
45:16 you can't fit into every single
45:18 conference otherwise you'll be very busy
45:20 so i'll try to get the feedback from
45:22 them and try to reapply me
45:23 next round and then using that feedback
45:26 i'll try to
45:27 find through my pitch and actually craft
45:31 the message
45:32 and send to another conference organizer
45:35 and and to increase the chance of
45:38 getting feature or getting noticed
45:40 uh if you know someone who know the
45:43 conference organizer
45:45 ask that guy or girl or lady or whatever
45:47 right to recommend you
45:49 to that organizer but you stand a higher
45:52 chance to get
45:53 a shot list that is how i would
45:57 suggest yeah so basically have uh a good
46:00 network
46:00 so it's not just about your personal
46:02 brand but also
46:04 like who you know yes
46:07 and uh the interesting situation is uh
46:09 like we talk now because i invited you
46:12 right but then i guess at some point
46:14 like you first you were reaching out to
46:16 different conference organizers meetup
46:18 organizers
46:20 how did it happen for you that instead
46:22 of you
46:23 applying to conferences it reversed
46:26 conference organizers started to
46:28 reach out to you and invite like how how
46:31 did it happen for you
46:33 um how did it happen to me this is
46:36 a very good question i think throughout
46:39 this
46:40 two years price journey i've attended
46:42 online meet up offline
46:44 and conferences i think one of the
46:47 reasons that i
46:48 suppose is because i share
46:52 my speaking experience on linkedin
46:55 and that people notice you hey you you
46:58 actually speak
47:00 in a public platform they notice you as
47:02 a speaker in data science bay
47:04 space they'll take more of that and
47:06 whenever they have this kind of
47:08 availability they approach you and
47:12 the other thing that i would say is
47:14 change your headline
47:15 and that really changed a lot of things
47:18 i didn't believe in that
47:19 first i i read an article from someone
47:22 else
47:23 and she said that if you want
47:26 to go for something you have to let
47:29 people know that
47:30 you are in this space first so linkedin
47:33 headline is the first thing that people
47:34 see you
47:35 even when they're reading your comment
47:37 this is the first thing they appear
47:38 so i immediately changed that instead of
47:40 data scientist
47:42 alone i changed data scientist vertical
47:45 bar
47:46 speaker and you can still see it now or
47:48 unlinked it
47:49 so children can't lie gets you noticed
47:52 by others not just by reading the
47:55 comment but also
47:56 when people are searching data science
47:58 speaker these three keywords
48:00 your profile stand a higher choice of
48:03 being on the top
48:04 and linkedin itself is like uh seo
48:08 but unlimited so your headline is like
48:11 the seo
48:12 order for people to look up to you yeah
48:15 okay
48:16 yeah interesting an interesting trick
48:19 but also i guess for you
48:20 like for you personally and this is
48:22 something we talked about at the
48:23 beginning
48:24 like what is personal brand it's being
48:27 known
48:28 in a certain niche and when i was
48:30 looking for speakers for this conference
48:32 i thought okay career session i need
48:35 somebody
48:35 who can speak about personal brand who
48:39 that my that person might be and then i
48:41 thought of you immediately so this is
48:43 like this is the power of a
48:44 personal brand like who has uh who is
48:47 talking about personal brand
48:49 in the data science space and for me
48:52 your name immediately
48:53 popped up so this is like a good example
48:56 this is a good example of a good
48:58 personal brand
48:59 oh you know that okay i'm great
49:01 officially efficient
49:03 so i did yeah okay i share that
49:06 and i think uh personal brand is
49:08 something that is uh
49:11 something that is underrated i mean in
49:14 most it's even not just data science but
49:16 in general
49:17 right people tend not to share with
49:21 other people
49:22 in terms of their experience especially
49:24 in asian countries
49:25 they're very reserved they're very
49:27 conservative we don't like to share
49:29 so i always recommend people hey just
49:31 share right just share and let people
49:33 know
49:34 but people tend which is understandable
49:36 people by nature tend to
49:39 scared to be charged and we all are
49:41 afraid of being judged and i think
49:44 you just need to accept that embrace it
49:47 and to share by sharing with the mindset
49:50 that you want to help
49:52 yeah and you're free from that yeah
49:56 because we actually this is a good topic
49:59 because we have a question
50:00 in slider how do you get the confidence
50:03 to write
50:04 when you learn data science yourself so
50:07 and this uh
50:08 like this is what you just talked about
50:10 like okay i wrote something and then
50:12 i need to press this post button and
50:14 then
50:15 i immediately think okay now when i post
50:18 this
50:19 when i press this button it goes live
50:21 everyone will see it
50:22 and everybody will think okay this
50:24 person has no idea
50:26 what he's talking about right so
50:30 yeah this is like how do you get this
50:32 confidence especially when you know that
50:33 uh
50:34 let's say you're just learning data
50:36 science you know that you're not
50:38 an expert in field you you know that you
50:41 might be mistaken
50:42 how do you convince yourself uh have
50:44 enough confidence to press this post
50:46 button
50:48 yeah i i definitely feel that in fact
50:51 if you read software articles at the
50:54 comments there
50:55 i do get a lot of these disagreements
50:58 and in fact i make a lot of mistakes not
51:00 just grammar mistakes but
51:02 there are science kind of technical
51:04 mistakes and i admit that
51:06 i admit that because i'm not experienced
51:09 enough
51:10 and i do share it for the sake of you
51:13 know sharing my experience and telling
51:14 others
51:15 now to get to me to get the confidence
51:17 to to share
51:18 to press that publish button
51:22 is that don't like to impress
51:26 or to show people how good you are like
51:28 if you if you
51:29 write just to show people how good you
51:31 are to impress others
51:33 i think that's not a good reason to
51:35 write
51:36 at the first place how i would say is
51:38 that
51:39 right because you want to share and help
51:42 others
51:43 that has been through the same struggle
51:45 as you are
51:47 right because when you write with the
51:49 mindset of just helping
51:51 it doesn't matter whether people
51:52 criticize you or not it's because you
51:54 just
51:55 do it out of good will right you don't
51:57 do it to impress either
51:58 so so that really gives me a strong
52:01 boost you know in confidence to
52:03 write and even i got a lot of different
52:06 comments that i still write
52:08 and that's fine because we all learn
52:10 from the process yeah
52:12 yeah maybe on linkedin it doesn't happen
52:14 as much at least to me personally
52:16 like when i share the community is more
52:18 uh
52:20 friendly yes uh like uh
52:23 but on twitter like it's sometimes like
52:26 just wild west
52:27 look for the twitter you can be
52:28 anonymous right and then
52:30 people write it on twitter like uh
52:34 a lot of nasty stuff like you don't know
52:37 anything like who allowed you to
52:39 to write on twitter and that is
52:42 demotivating
52:43 like next time you you want to write
52:45 something and then you think okay like
52:46 should i press this
52:47 uh like do i want to get these kind of
52:49 comments
52:51 uh yeah this is uh like how
52:54 do you develop like this thick skin that
52:57 uh
52:58 that these comments do not uh you know
53:00 get into you
53:02 do you have maybe an idea how to do that
53:05 uh
53:06 usually i would say that different
53:08 approaches depending on who
53:10 uh the individual is but i would say to
53:13 the best doing these
53:14 negative social comments try to engage
53:17 them i try to understand where they are
53:19 coming from
53:20 you i do receive this from time to time
53:22 i just
53:23 reply the comment okay use that
53:26 understand that and thanks for sharing
53:28 and i really appreciate it
53:30 um and stuff like that and see where you
53:32 can improve on instead of
53:34 uh going against them i think this is
53:37 you know
53:37 you're holding on to your opinion
53:39 everyone has their own opinion and
53:42 nobody deserves that their opinion is
53:46 always right nobody's perfect
53:47 so to be very open-minded thinking that
53:50 your opinion is less wrong compared to
53:54 others
53:55 then you won't really feel like you need
53:58 to go against the people when they
54:00 put some negative comments and by saying
54:03 that you appreciate that command
54:05 this make people feel a bit you know
54:08 appreciated that they wouldn't feel
54:10 uh offended hey this guy you know what's
54:12 this guy doing
54:13 uh this guy doesn't allow me to say
54:15 something here is he hiding something
54:17 you know
54:17 he's gonna play yeah
54:21 yeah indeed so it kind of like the
54:24 energy may be
54:25 negative maybe the person is trying to
54:27 start like a flame or whatever
54:29 like a flamewar but it's like you're
54:31 turning this negative energy into
54:33 something more positive right and
54:36 you will have a good conversation we
54:38 have a related
54:39 comment uh about imposter syndrome
54:43 and i think this is like this is what
54:45 stops us from
54:46 clicking that publish button right
54:50 like how and i i imagine that you also
54:53 have to deal with uh with that like how
54:56 do you overcome especially when it comes
54:57 to social media or public speaking
54:59 how do you overcome that exactly
55:02 uh yeah thanks for sharing i think i do
55:06 face these from time to time
55:08 i always admit that i'm not good i'm not
55:11 a technical person
55:13 i tell people even to people who are
55:17 close to me or people
55:18 who are not so close to me that i say
55:22 i'm not a technical guy and if you ask
55:24 me about machine learning in general
55:26 deep learning in general i can answer
55:28 that if you ask me something that's very
55:30 technical in deep learning
55:31 or machine learning i would say i don't
55:33 know because i am not an expert in this
55:35 space
55:36 so to go back to your question sometimes
55:38 we do face the imposer syndrome
55:41 but how to overcome this how i overcome
55:43 it is
55:44 by understanding me myself better what
55:47 am i good
55:48 at what am i not good at
55:51 and and one of the quotes that i love
55:54 as mentioned by jack ma is when people
55:57 say you are not good
55:58 you need to think whether you are really
56:00 dead not good
56:02 when people say you are good you need to
56:04 think twice
56:05 that are you really that good so this is
56:07 how i keep my balance
56:09 not trying to be so too over confident
56:12 when people say i'm good
56:13 or not trying to be too depressed when
56:16 people say i'm not good
56:18 so so yeah so this is how i overcome
56:21 that that
56:22 kind of syndrome so just uh
56:25 yeah realizing you are who you are and
56:29 just leaving with that self-awareness
56:32 be really self-aware of your strengths
56:35 and weaknesses
56:36 by thoroughly analyzing your entire
56:40 story your career story
56:42 where you come from what have you come
56:44 across so far
56:46 what have you learned what are the
56:47 mistakes and what your strengths
56:50 yeah i also want to talk a bit about
56:53 your teaching experience because i think
56:55 this
56:55 is quite connected to the topic of
56:58 personal brand
57:00 and to the topic of today's talk like we
57:03 talked about
57:04 sharing knowledge a lot um so
57:07 um like sharing knowledge being a
57:10 teacher
57:10 is it a good way of establishing
57:14 personal brand
57:16 like being a teacher and then you know
57:18 just going there
57:19 and started you know putting courses uh
57:24 this is probably the best way of doing
57:25 that right
57:27 i see are you referring that uh to to
57:30 build an online course to teach someone
57:32 is that yes yes like uh you just go
57:36 there and
57:36 uh i imagine that this is something you
57:38 also do because you're an
57:40 instructor in some school
57:43 we will talk about this in a bit um yeah
57:46 and you want to
57:47 uh become maybe like
57:51 establish your personal brand and teach
57:54 people
57:55 like just go on linkedin and studying
57:58 like with the idea of teaching
58:01 like let's say teaching data science or
58:03 something like that
58:06 so i think definitely that helps
58:07 teaching especially if you're able to
58:09 build your own online course that could
58:12 scale up
58:13 like a bit a lot so so if you are able
58:16 to do your own online course
58:18 and to teach by sharing your expertise
58:21 that doesn't just generate revenue for
58:23 you but also that
58:25 builds your personal brand at scale
58:28 right because
58:28 people can grow in your in your platform
58:31 and people know you
58:33 so so one of the things that i i
58:37 want to highlight here is it's called
58:39 data science
58:40 uh boot camp data science bootcamp uh
58:44 file organized by some other organizers
58:47 and their platform is entirely free but
58:50 they teach it
58:51 for the sake of helping more people
58:53 learn their science
58:54 i think there's this one of the best
58:57 ways to
58:57 to build your personal brands but i
59:00 think if you are working on
59:02 this on your own full time so you need
59:05 some cash to come in
59:06 so you really need to balance between
59:08 building your personal brand
59:10 and generating income for yourself you
59:12 can build your personal brand
59:13 but if no one's paying your staff you'll
59:16 still be broke
59:18 so i think there are two phases of this
59:21 yeah
59:22 yeah so let's say if i want to start
59:26 building an online course about data
59:28 science and sell it
59:30 then i need to have i need already to
59:33 have a personal brand so people when see
59:35 that i
59:35 published a course they okay i know this
59:38 person
59:39 i trust this person i trust this person
59:42 with my money
59:44 so i will pay this person and get a
59:46 course right
59:47 and if you don't have this personal
59:49 brand then
59:50 yeah nobody will buy because nobody
59:52 knows you right
59:54 okay and then one way of doing this of
59:57 actually getting this personal brand is
59:59 just giving the content away for free
1:00:01 just you know take the course and
1:00:02 release like this data science
1:00:04 bootcamp you mentioned they just started
1:00:06 teaching people for free
1:00:07 and now everyone knows them like they
1:00:09 they
1:00:11 like they became better known they
1:00:12 established their brand and people know
1:00:14 they can trust them
1:00:15 right yes and that depends on how you
1:00:19 want to frame your your brand because i
1:00:22 think everyone has their own brand
1:00:25 we just couldn't copy other people's
1:00:27 brand so
1:00:28 so uh one thing to add on here is to
1:00:30 build your own personal brand
1:00:32 you really need to know what you stand
1:00:34 for
1:00:35 like are you standing for well what are
1:00:37 your values right
1:00:39 is your value uh consistencies of value
1:00:43 serving other people right is your value
1:00:46 hard work or whatever
1:00:48 so once you know your values
1:00:51 there's no question that you couldn't
1:00:53 build your personal plan
1:00:54 if you build your personal brand for the
1:00:57 sake of building it
1:00:59 somehow somewhere someday you might be
1:01:02 very confused what am i doing here what
1:01:05 is the brand i'm standing off
1:01:06 right so i think corporate brand and
1:01:09 personal brands are very similar
1:01:11 apple their innovation thing different
1:01:14 so this is the brand
1:01:15 personal brand what are we really
1:01:17 believing to me
1:01:19 i to me i really i think that
1:01:22 serving others sharing right is my
1:01:26 value what i stand for so so
1:01:29 whenever i post content online i know
1:01:30 that i want to help
1:01:32 i want to share i could be wrong i just
1:01:35 admit that and i improve on that
1:01:37 right so so i think this is something to
1:01:38 note
1:01:40 so and this is probably like having
1:01:42 these values realizing what these values
1:01:44 are this is what helps you to click that
1:01:46 publish button right
1:01:47 because you know why why you're doing
1:01:49 this you know why you click this button
1:01:51 and then it makes it easier
1:01:53 exactly you just hit the point know your
1:01:55 why right if you don't know your why
1:01:58 that there's no way that you can do it
1:02:00 in long term
1:02:01 so if you just do it for the sake of
1:02:03 doing and you don't know
1:02:04 why am i doing this at the first place
1:02:06 and someday you may just question
1:02:08 yourself
1:02:08 am i doing the right thing or am i not
1:02:11 yeah okay and i know that you also have
1:02:15 a course about personal brand is it
1:02:17 something that
1:02:18 like you know environment like coming up
1:02:20 with your own values
1:02:22 and things like this is it something
1:02:23 that you cover there in the course
1:02:26 yeah uh in this course i do cover two
1:02:28 main things
1:02:30 uh actually platforms one is medium
1:02:33 my favorite and my link link and
1:02:35 linkedin essentially i
1:02:37 did construct the whole things how to
1:02:39 show you how you can build your personal
1:02:41 brand on
1:02:41 medium and linkedin and how to polish
1:02:45 your portfolio
1:02:46 on linkedin as well so for someone who
1:02:48 is
1:02:49 new to medium and linkedin i also help
1:02:52 them build
1:02:53 their medium profile how to publish your
1:02:55 content how to scale your content
1:02:57 what content to post so some of the
1:03:01 resources that i share feed me possible
1:03:04 i did share that also
1:03:06 but i share that in-depth in the course
1:03:08 and
1:03:09 finally i also share some of the steps
1:03:12 that i use
1:03:13 whenever i publish my content so it's
1:03:15 the
1:03:16 content strategy that i employ yeah to
1:03:19 build your personal brand on medium
1:03:21 and linkedin because i i only share what
1:03:25 i
1:03:25 have been using and hopefully to help
1:03:28 more other people in this
1:03:30 yeah and to what is a like you mentioned
1:03:33 content strategy and you said you help
1:03:35 people
1:03:36 developing this so what is the content
1:03:38 strategy
1:03:40 yeah good one how to find
1:03:43 your content with many many different
1:03:46 resources i myself have compiled
1:03:48 a list of resources that i'm going to
1:03:50 look up to whenever i generate content
1:03:52 there are a few things that i share with
1:03:54 you fiddly plus you all
1:03:56 this right so we look at other people's
1:03:58 post
1:03:59 quora my ideas uh sometimes from
1:04:02 twitter as well and sometimes from stack
1:04:05 overflow
1:04:07 and these are just some ways that you
1:04:09 can first get some ideas
1:04:11 to generate content and to write a good
1:04:14 story
1:04:14 there's another skill some it's called
1:04:17 story styling skill
1:04:18 and i've been learning this how to write
1:04:20 a good story to engage other people
1:04:23 so i'm still learning this how to write
1:04:25 it and rank in a way that
1:04:27 engages other people they want to keep
1:04:29 reading your stuff
1:04:30 right so this is the second thing the
1:04:32 third thing is
1:04:34 something that's not technical when
1:04:37 you should post and how often you should
1:04:39 post on linkedin whatever channel there
1:04:42 is always
1:04:42 an optimum time to post and that depends
1:04:46 on the demographics of your audience to
1:04:49 me
1:04:49 my best time to post on linkedin is 6
1:04:53 p.m
1:04:54 singapore time so you always see my post
1:04:57 coming out on
1:04:58 6 p.m singapore time
1:05:01 on twitter itself i split it into three
1:05:04 different
1:05:05 times but i'm still testing it out it's
1:05:07 9 a.m 12 p.m 6 p.m
1:05:11 yeah i think i do something similar but
1:05:14 i still don't know how to find a good
1:05:15 time
1:05:16 so how did you find this that 6 00 pm
1:05:19 singapore time
1:05:20 on linkedin works best for you yeah for
1:05:23 linkedin i've been
1:05:24 testing quite a fair bit i tested in the
1:05:27 morning
1:05:27 nothing happened like zero i tested
1:05:31 before
1:05:31 lunch 12 p.m and it was quite a few
1:05:34 engagement i tested three and four pm
1:05:37 people are still working nobody engages
1:05:40 and i tested in six p.m or after that
1:05:42 maybe sometimes
1:05:43 9 p.m 7 p.m so 6 to 9 p.m to me is a
1:05:46 sweet spot
1:05:47 and i think one of the reasons is that
1:05:49 most of my audience came from either u.s
1:05:51 or india
1:05:53 so that fits in their time schedule when
1:05:55 i look at
1:05:57 people who look at my linkedin to
1:05:59 demographic
1:06:01 okay makes sense and how can people find
1:06:03 your course
1:06:05 oh yeah they can't just go to
1:06:08 okay share the link because uh let me
1:06:11 see
1:06:12 they can just type in personal brand to
1:06:14 kids
1:06:16 personal brand toolkits yes let me just
1:06:20 i will definitely share this in the
1:06:21 description sure
1:06:23 i'll just try it in this zoom chats yeah
1:06:25 for that yeah
1:06:27 yeah i'll share this in in the comments
1:06:29 sure
1:06:30 thanks appreciate it yeah maybe
1:06:33 uh uh like a question to me like all we
1:06:36 say like it
1:06:37 looks glorious like okay like develop a
1:06:39 personal brand and then you become
1:06:41 famous you become known for a certain
1:06:43 thing people will reach out to you
1:06:46 invite to conferences but other
1:06:48 disadvantages of having
1:06:50 a good personal brand of being known
1:06:55 disadvantages i would say sometimes
1:06:59 i would be too carried away
1:07:02 by my social engagement because
1:07:06 i tend to commit myself to
1:07:09 engage other people's posts so i don't
1:07:12 just post content i also engage other
1:07:13 people's posts
1:07:15 liking commenting sharing so these
1:07:18 consume a lot of my times and i tend to
1:07:21 lack of focus on some of the things that
1:07:24 are more important
1:07:26 the priorities could be something that
1:07:28 uh
1:07:30 uh that i need to take note of and the
1:07:33 second
1:07:33 thing is that um it's time consuming
1:07:39 i would say when you start generating
1:07:42 content
1:07:43 first time you struggle second time you
1:07:45 don't know what to do
1:07:47 and then slowly slowly you get used to
1:07:49 the process of content generation
1:07:51 i think that takes time so i think the
1:07:54 most important disadvantage
1:07:56 is managing your priority
1:08:00 yeah okay but uh this is maybe it's not
1:08:03 an advantage maybe it's like uh
1:08:04 not a buck it's a feature like this is
1:08:06 uh like it's a useful skill to pick up
1:08:08 anyways not
1:08:10 it's not necessarily related to the
1:08:12 personal brand
1:08:13 like maybe it's also useful at work and
1:08:16 for
1:08:16 other things okay
1:08:20 well i think we covered all the
1:08:22 questions uh
1:08:25 so yeah there's still one question in
1:08:27 slider is how much time you spent on
1:08:29 creating and sharing
1:08:30 contact content and
1:08:34 how do you manage time to build a
1:08:35 personal brand and
1:08:37 actually do data science so there are
1:08:40 two questions okay
1:08:42 how much time yes let's start with the
1:08:44 first one how much time do you spend on
1:08:46 creating and sharing content
1:08:48 i think we actually talked about that
1:08:50 like you said like a couple of hours on
1:08:51 the weekend
1:08:52 right yes i would say every week
1:08:57 i will allocate two to three hours of my
1:08:59 time
1:09:00 on weekend sometimes saturday sometimes
1:09:02 sunday
1:09:03 to just sit down and generate the
1:09:06 content by
1:09:07 writing my posts on hood sweets that i
1:09:10 just shared you hootsuite
1:09:12 go to schedule once i write my post and
1:09:14 i just schedule it
1:09:16 in the interval maybe one post in one
1:09:19 day
1:09:20 right for linkedin and i'll just
1:09:22 schedule it right away so that takes me
1:09:24 about
1:09:25 two to three hours and the reason for
1:09:26 that is it takes me about one hour
1:09:29 to go and find ideas and and content to
1:09:32 write
1:09:33 it told me the rest of the time to just
1:09:35 write the content
1:09:37 it's not easy to write a good story and
1:09:40 stuff like that so so i would say two to
1:09:42 three hours
1:09:43 yeah and regarding the second question
1:09:47 it was how do you manage time to build a
1:09:50 personal brand
1:09:51 and at the same time do actual data
1:09:53 science
1:09:55 i see cool
1:09:57 [Music]
1:09:58 to me because it depends on your job
1:10:01 nature so my current geometry is more
1:10:03 the kitchen site
1:10:04 so i do share and teach at the same time
1:10:07 i do
1:10:08 less on the implementation stuff because
1:10:11 i'm teaching what i've learned
1:10:13 but last time when i was still working
1:10:15 as a data scientist
1:10:17 that was quite hectic i would say you
1:10:19 just need to manage the time
1:10:21 on your own and and this reason why i
1:10:24 allocated my time
1:10:25 to be just two to three hours a week no
1:10:27 more than that
1:10:28 but on a daily basis i still engage with
1:10:31 others
1:10:31 not more than 30 minutes a day on
1:10:34 lengthy
1:10:35 so that's how i manage my time and
1:10:38 i would say try to utilize your
1:10:42 day time to engage with others
1:10:45 like when you're committing on a train
1:10:47 on a bus you're traveling you're walking
1:10:50 try to commute uh communicate with
1:10:52 others on social media
1:10:54 and that helps a bit because you don't
1:10:56 need to look at your phone when you're
1:10:57 working
1:10:58 you don't need to look at phone before
1:10:59 you sleep so other things are done
1:11:03 in your day time
1:11:06 and when people do that it's probably
1:11:08 the best time to
1:11:09 to post right to publish yeah correct
1:11:12 this people are
1:11:16 commuting yes um so
1:11:19 last question do you have any book
1:11:21 recommendation
1:11:23 well i do share a few so first and
1:11:26 foremost uh of course i
1:11:27 i feel like i just need to mention
1:11:29 andrew's book
1:11:31 the hungry page machine learning book
1:11:33 okay
1:11:34 yes just just check it out it's the best
1:11:36 seller on amazon
1:11:38 i've read that myself the first edition
1:11:41 and it is
1:11:42 really easy to understand so if you are
1:11:44 someone that
1:11:45 watches studied powers but you do want
1:11:47 to read something that's so technical
1:11:50 then go read this book because uh andrew
1:11:53 really gave a very good intuition
1:11:56 for common machine learning models and
1:11:58 this gave a strong foundation
1:12:00 when we are studying else and the second
1:12:03 book i recommend is an intro
1:12:05 to machine learning oh sorry not machine
1:12:09 learning
1:12:10 an intro to statistical learning
1:12:13 oh okay yeah from like from stanford
1:12:15 right like
1:12:16 yeah this is like a bible if you want to
1:12:19 learn machine learning
1:12:20 i i read this book when i was starting
1:12:24 out this is my first book
1:12:25 that i read and that really gave me a
1:12:28 strong foundation
1:12:30 in terms of how machine learning is
1:12:31 built essentially it's just calculus and
1:12:34 linear algebra
1:12:35 so when you practice now the rest will
1:12:37 be easy for you
