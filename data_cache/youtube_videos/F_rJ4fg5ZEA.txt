0:59 me here now I
1:02 will open the questions I prepared for
1:06 you and
1:11 um are you ready to start
1:16 yes okay so this week we'll talk about
1:18 designing a data science organization
1:21 and we have a special guest today liisa
1:23 liisa is a director of data science for
1:25 Twitter and she leads an organization of
1:28 200 data scientists
1:30 uh before that Lisa worked at Microsoft
1:33 and maybe you'll tell us a bit more
1:35 about that uh here so yeah Welcome to
1:38 our
1:39 event thanks for having me yeah before
1:42 we go into our main topic of today which
1:44 is uh um designing data science
1:48 organization uh let's start with your
1:50 background can you tell us about your
1:52 career Journey so
1:54 far sure um so yeah let's see my
1:57 background is in U math and science
2:00 um my bachelor and master were in
2:03 applied math um I always applying that
2:05 towards various engineering Sciences so
2:07 really passionate about just like the
2:09 the application of math and data towards
2:12 um various real world scenarios and
2:15 applications um let's see I started my
2:18 career after various internships in um
2:21 Academia and Industry um I I started my
2:25 um full-time career at Microsoft um
2:28 originally I was in the veler division
2:30 um working on Visual Studio the C and
2:33 Visual Basic languages um the I was
2:36 working on the the IDE and user
2:39 experience around those languages as
2:40 well and so that was a great opportunity
2:42 just to to Really while I was working on
2:44 a product that was catered by developer
2:47 um catered For developers to learn about
2:49 you know building software in the tech
2:50 industry and all the various best
2:52 practices that come with that um and
2:54 it's been interesting actually to see
2:55 how some of those can be applied towards
2:57 data science the way that we um run data
3:00 science projects as well um as my role
3:03 there evolved from working product um to
3:06 looking at customer feedback and then
3:08 over time increasingly you know Big Data
3:10 was growing in the industry and we were
3:11 interested in more of the quantitative
3:13 in addition to the qualitative feedback
3:15 um then I started working on our
3:17 Telemetry systems um our product
3:19 analytics
3:20 performance um as well as things like
3:22 our overall uh metrics that we were
3:24 using to run the business and our
3:26 various business reviews um and then
3:28 data science techniques we started
3:30 employing to um understand the the usage
3:33 patterns of our users as well um so I
3:35 was uh doing that role within data
3:38 within visual studio for some time and
3:40 then as the cloud was growing and we
3:42 were increasing our our focus on Azure
3:44 within the company then I moved to um a
3:46 data science Organization for Azure and
3:49 I was in that or um That Grew over
3:51 several years um and and and was leading
3:54 a data science team within our what
3:55 we're calling Microsoft cloud data
3:57 Sciences so again we had a lot of focus
3:59 on Azure um over time as or was growing
4:02 but also started working on um like the
4:04 intersection with Microsoft teams um
4:07 powerbi and other cloud services as well
4:10 um so in that role you know we we were
4:12 doing data science for the product
4:14 looking at and the retention of
4:16 different services and how different
4:18 features and changes would um impact and
4:21 improve that um but also working with
4:23 the business program so with our our
4:25 marketing team on um you know lifetime
4:29 value value of users and um optimizing
4:32 our paid media and spend efforts in that
4:34 way um working with our support team
4:36 also with um various um optimizations on
4:40 our support practices um our field and
4:43 crossup so Etc and then um most recently
4:46 I moved to a role within Twitter um it's
4:49 the the one that you um mentioned at the
4:52 start and so started off working on our
4:54 Discovery and connection um teams which
4:57 is all about how users come to the
4:58 product and then engage with in the
5:00 product and I'm currently leading data
5:02 science across the um Twitter product so
5:05 all the the features that you know and
5:07 get to use um on a regular basis um
5:10 using data to really help Drive our
5:12 decisions and also improve the um the
5:15 various ml models that help run the user
5:18 experience as well um in addition to the
5:20 Twitter product um my or also extends
5:23 across the platform and so that includes
5:25 various aspects of using data and
5:27 science to evolve our infrastructure
5:30 strategy experimentation platform um
5:33 developer experience
5:35 Etc yeah you've at Microsoft you touched
5:38 pretty much everything right uh like
5:41 there quite a for how long did you work
5:44 there that was it Microsoft for 17 years
5:47 um and so the was there and then back in
5:49 September I moved over to
5:51 Twitter okay yeah that's amazing I yeah
5:55 I remember switching from Deli to C and
5:57 it was uh like I was pretty amazed it
5:59 was long long time ago I don't do c
6:02 anymore but yeah that was amazing uh and
6:06 Twitter like does everyone at Twitter
6:09 have to have a Twitter
6:11 account um it's not required but um
6:15 encouraged yeah I mean I think with any
6:17 any product you're working on it's good
6:19 to to use the product and Microsoft we
6:21 call it like dog fooding the product and
6:23 you get a a firsthand experience lot of
6:25 things that do work on all right so
6:28 sometime ago I came across your article
6:31 which was about designing a data science
6:33 organization and actually this is what I
6:35 wanted to talk about in this podcast
6:38 episode and you start this article I
6:40 think you wrote actually it back uh back
6:43 at Microsoft right it is it's a couple
6:45 of years old I think or maybe one year
6:47 old I don't remember but it's not
6:49 something you published yesterday right
6:50 so it was still back at uh Microsoft so
6:54 you start this article with a section to
6:56 centralize or decentralize can you tell
6:59 us more what you mean by that like like
7:02 why is it even a choice like why do we
7:04 have to think about this sure um yeah I
7:08 mean the topic came up because it's
7:09 something that I was observing across
7:11 Microsoft at the time there were certain
7:15 um engineering product teams within
7:18 Azure that might have an embedded data
7:20 science they just found that they you
7:22 know needed that function and so you're
7:24 kind of like you're you're running a
7:25 business you can add whatever um
7:27 function you need and in that role um
7:29 I've seen this with a few other
7:31 companies as well and so you would have
7:33 you know an an engineering manager for
7:36 example and then they might have one or
7:37 two individual contributor data
7:39 scientist reporting to them directly um
7:42 and then the other Paradigm that I saw
7:43 is that you would have a um a
7:46 centralized data science organization
7:48 where data scientists were reporting to
7:49 data science managers but then they
7:51 would work in somewhat of a um embedded
7:54 way with the stakeholders so that they
7:56 were essentially aligned with various
7:58 partners that way and so I was you know
8:02 just reflecting on the different pros
8:03 and cons of the two different models and
8:05 then how to set up for success and
8:07 either in either um construct to ensure
8:11 that you kind of cater to the um
8:13 leverage the pros the benefits as well
8:15 as solve for the the
8:17 cons so the second one you mentioned
8:19 centralized data science team um so you
8:23 you said that there is a data science
8:24 manager but the other part I didn't
8:27 quite get so you said that they are
8:29 still
8:30 embedded so
8:33 right yeah we can go back maybe to the
8:35 Azure example so you would have so we
8:37 had like a a whole organization um you
8:42 know with a a VP and then um managers of
8:46 managers for across the various areas um
8:48 all of data science and data engineering
8:51 we can talk about like the different the
8:52 different roles within data but a data
8:53 organization and then the embedding is
8:56 essentially you know how you structure
8:58 within that organization so you would
9:00 align to let's say a part of the team
9:02 that was working with our partners a
9:04 part of the team that was working on
9:05 startups um a part that worked on um you
9:09 know Azure for developers and so each of
9:11 those teams would align with another um
9:14 business group of you know product
9:16 managers Engineers design research
9:19 marketing Etc um so although they
9:22 directly reported within this broad data
9:24 science or they still had this
9:26 connection to a stakeholder versus the
9:28 other model was where they would
9:29 actually be embedded um be fully
9:31 embedded with a a solid line meaning
9:33 like they reported to that other
9:35 function so this one is decentralized
9:38 right so the the one you just described
9:41 yes okay so in the decentralized you
9:43 have a team that works on a specific
9:46 part of the product or whatever so
9:48 specific area of responsibilities in
9:50 your example it was like uh a team that
9:53 works with startups within Azure for
9:55 example right um and then in this team
9:57 we have an engineering manager Maybe
9:59 product manager a bunch of other people
10:01 and then there are also data scientists
10:03 in this team and the data scientists
10:05 report to the EM right and this is uh
10:08 decentralized in the sense that you have
10:10 a bunch of teams like that and in every
10:12 team or in some teams that need data
10:14 science they have data scientists right
10:17 and they are spread ac across the
10:19 organization right so it's not like just
10:21 one place where they sit they're
10:23 everywhere they they where they are
10:25 needed right this is the decentralized
10:27 part okay and then embedded uh here
10:30 means the term means that you take data
10:34 scientists and you embed them in the
10:36 team that works on some area right yes
10:40 okay and then the other thing
10:43 centralized well then there's also um I
10:45 think between the like centralized and
10:47 decentralized sometimes I I mentioned
10:49 that ultimately there can also be a
10:51 hybrid where you kind of centralize at a
10:53 certain level but it's not like there's
10:55 just one data science Organization for
10:56 the whole company mhm and in this
10:59 example centralized could be like a team
11:02 that has a data science manager and then
11:04 I don't know eight data scientists
11:05 reporting to the manager and then maybe
11:07 we actually don't just have one team
11:09 there is there are multiple teams each
11:12 has a data science manager then maybe
11:14 there is a head of data science and
11:16 they're just somehow isolated right they
11:19 are Central mhm okay and then the hybrid
11:23 is you said uh like how do you actually
11:26 combine this two uh well the last one
11:28 that you mentioned is essentially the
11:30 hybrid like it's centralized to a
11:31 certain level but there's still multiple
11:33 across the company and that's ultimately
11:35 the most common um model that I've seen
11:38 that you know at both companies because
11:41 for example Microsoft is such a large um
11:44 company you could say it's almost like
11:46 multiple companies so many different
11:48 products um so there's not just one data
11:51 science or across the entire company
11:54 there's kind of a dedicated Central of
11:56 mass or gravity for you know for Xbox Bo
11:59 for Azure um for developer division for
12:03 for different groups in that way um and
12:06 Twitter is well we're um divided into a
12:09 few different functions so for example
12:11 there's another data science
12:13 organization um for our ads and revenue
12:17 group MH so let's say let's take this
12:20 example so we have a data team or data
12:23 orc that is responsible for ads and
12:26 revenue right you said uh so have a
12:29 bunch of like a few teams right there a
12:32 couple of teams and each team has uh
12:35 like what kind of U structure do they
12:38 have is it like data scientist reporting
12:40 to data science manager yes yes so
12:42 there's a head of data science for that
12:44 entire division um but then for example
12:47 I mentioned that I'm you know leading
12:48 data science for the the product
12:49 experience and so there's there is more
12:52 than one or in that way um however
12:55 within those two groups you know you
12:57 have the data science
12:59 reporting together MH and then these
13:02 data scientists do they just sit
13:04 together as a team isolated from the
13:06 rest of the company or how do they
13:08 actually work together on let's say
13:10 because this ads and uh monetization it
13:14 doesn't exist in isolation right so you
13:16 actually need to display ads and then
13:18 there is a product team with backend
13:21 developers front end developers product
13:22 manager that is responsible for this
13:25 right so how do data scientists interact
13:27 with these people there do they sit
13:29 together do they sit alone like how does
13:32 uh does this work yeah so in any of
13:36 these models that you set up for you
13:37 need the data scientists to be working
13:38 with the different functions because all
13:40 the the work that we do I mean there's
13:42 there's some if you own a model that you
13:44 can just you know fully I suppose
13:46 iterate on um within the DS or and run
13:49 that in production but I think for most
13:51 of the changes that we're making whether
13:53 it's like a program change that we're
13:55 suggesting or a um a product change that
13:59 we've you know seen in in we recommend
14:01 based on the data um you know we need
14:03 other functions to partner with we need
14:05 the engineers to develop it we need the
14:07 product managers and the designers to
14:09 help design that user experience we need
14:11 the the research team to also partner
14:13 with them um on what they're hearing
14:15 from the the users in terms of verbatim
14:17 experience directly and so yeah all of
14:19 these um you some as I call it like you
14:22 need a good catcher for all of the
14:23 different ideas to help act on it and
14:26 the impact of the data scientist is only
14:28 so far as those um ideas get socialized
14:32 adopted and then acted on and then you
14:33 see the impact of those changes um in
14:36 measurable ways and so yeah I think in
14:39 in all these models the data scientists
14:40 need to work closely with these other
14:42 functions and so that's where some of
14:43 the the pros and cons come into play um
14:45 regarding the different models in terms
14:47 of what they enable and what they make
14:49 harder um and then how you solve for
14:51 that no matter what model you're in so
14:55 to summarize this uh and make sure I am
14:59 uh I understood you correctly so in both
15:01 these models data scientists end up
15:04 sitting together with the feature team
15:06 with the product team that is
15:07 responsible on this specific area of the
15:09 product right but the difference here is
15:12 who they report do they report to the
15:14 data science manager or do they report
15:16 to the engineering manager
15:23 right one moment yeah yeah yeah
15:32 okay I'll take a note of this to make
15:34 sure I do not forget the
15:36 question ah you're back yes okay I was
15:40 about to take the note of the question
15:42 but now I forgot I think I was giving
15:44 you a summary right so the summary was
15:46 that um so you have the team of data
15:49 scientists oh sorry you have a team a
15:52 feature team and then you embed data
15:54 scientists there the main difference
15:55 between centralized and decentralized
15:58 way or of arranging this is in one case
16:01 in the decentralized case the data
16:03 scientists report to engineering manager
16:06 and in the other case in the centralized
16:08 case data scientists report to data
16:10 science manager but in these two cases
16:13 both of them are embedded in the feature
16:15 teams right correct and so you know if
16:18 you are reporting directly within the
16:21 feature team that embedding happens
16:23 naturally like you're already included
16:25 in all of the team rhythms and forums um
16:28 you have the context on the domain which
16:30 is a key area that any data scientist
16:32 needs to be successful you just kind of
16:34 get that through osmosis you're
16:36 immersing it with the team that you're
16:37 in dayto day you're in all of the All
16:41 Hands like um kind of connected with
16:43 that team and the mission um and yeah
16:47 and then perhaps on the other side the
16:49 the business owners they always have
16:52 like dedicated resourcing that is
16:54 aligned with their area that they have
16:55 you know that's fully kind of in their
16:57 control versus that might be being PRI
16:58 prioritize um across the or so um yeah
17:02 maybe going back to the data scientist
17:03 experience as you're in that um that
17:05 model reporting that the business area
17:07 it makes it really easy to one um get
17:10 that context as well as have the team
17:12 right there directly to be able to to
17:14 act on the recommendations that that you
17:16 make um in the other model where you're
17:19 centralized you have to um you know be
17:22 proactive about that and I think it
17:23 works best also when you have other when
17:25 you have partners that are having that
17:27 top of mind and really looking at each
17:29 function as equal Partners um within
17:32 Twitter we have a um a culture around
17:36 like each function being co-owners and
17:38 so you know including each one directly
17:40 is just kind of the the default within
17:42 each of the forums um you have
17:44 engineering design product research and
17:45 data science as well working together
17:48 there whether that's at the very
17:49 beginning of the cycle like the strategy
17:51 and planning as well as like as you go
17:53 on to the the product road map and
17:55 future changes and kind of measuring um
17:57 the the different hypotheses is that you
17:59 had tried as well just wanted to make
18:03 sure I understood this what I said each
18:05 function is a co-owner by function you
18:07 mean you have like a data science
18:09 function you have analytics function you
18:12 have product management function
18:14 software engineering function right but
18:17 then everyone sits in the same team
18:19 right that's why um yeah so we we're not
18:22 we're all reporting to separate teams so
18:24 it requires a little bit more of an
18:25 effort you have to make sure that you
18:27 know you have forum where everybody can
18:29 come together that your slack channels
18:33 and Google Groups are you know are
18:35 including everybody you know it's not on
18:38 any anyone there you know kind of
18:40 straightforward and but just requires
18:41 like ongoing but I guess a team has to
18:44 have a some sort of rythm right some
18:46 sort of um I don't know ceremonies and
18:50 things like this so for example like you
18:52 start with planning then you work for
18:54 two weeks uh then you finish with I
18:57 don't know a retrospect
18:59 some sort of process right and then
19:01 everyone from different functions have
19:04 to come together right and to have to
19:06 they have to align to work at the same
19:09 PA right work together which is what I
19:11 mean by working as one team right
19:15 yes correct and there there's always um
19:19 you know you're kind of getting into the
19:21 planning process and how that works
19:22 across functions and yeah there's always
19:24 an aspect of coordination independency
19:26 management that come into play there um
19:28 you want to have alignment across the
19:31 road maps of each of the respective
19:33 disciplines functions within the the
19:35 team area um you generally have like
19:37 certain company schedules around those
19:39 planning Cycles or that's going to
19:41 quarterly or um twice a year or you know
19:44 even kind of getting more granular from
19:46 there and so you know let's say you know
19:50 product setting a road map engineering
19:53 setting a road map you know they're
19:54 they're done in conversations
19:55 coordinating together but the details of
19:57 what each function need to do is um you
20:00 know somewhat distinct and so as each
20:01 team is creating that for themselves as
20:03 they plan what they're going to execute
20:05 on then you kind of need a to sequence
20:07 that a bit so that um you know that
20:09 folks can align and um work together
20:11 there as well for dependency management
20:14 and co-ownership part is about like
20:16 let's say if we take data scientists it
20:19 doesn't mean that data scientists just
20:20 focus on data science they probably take
20:24 uh like area that are close to data
20:27 science as well like I don't know some
20:28 bits of engineering some bits of
20:30 analytics right so they are not just
20:32 alone but also know what's going on in
20:34 general in the domain where they work on
20:37 right um yes I think there's you know
20:40 there's an aspect there regarding the
20:43 the work you end up doing about like how
20:45 how hard you kind of set the line
20:46 between the roles and responsibilities
20:48 that I think for the co-ownership I
20:50 think the main thing that comes to mind
20:51 for me is you know just each role
20:54 feeling like you know they have a voice
20:56 in any discussion and not being confined
20:58 in like what's traditionally expected
21:00 from that function and so you know that
21:04 can come into play as like we're we're
21:06 deciding on the the product strategy and
21:08 Direction you know you really want to
21:10 hear Leverage The superpowers of each
21:13 function and kind of the unique
21:14 experiences that they have perspectives
21:17 and um incorporate that into the the
21:19 direction um because you know Engineers
21:23 might have seen more you know the
21:24 different experiments that they had ran
21:26 over time and they have that in mind
21:28 product like might have different
21:29 designs that they've tried and they know
21:30 has worked as have not DS has like seen
21:33 the data for various areas and so you
21:35 really want to kind of hear from all of
21:37 the reflections that each role has on
21:39 like whether you know this is going to
21:41 be a good plan or not or how we should
21:42 try it and how to drisk or um maybe
21:45 Playing devil's advocate and thinking
21:47 about you know a certain direction we're
21:49 taking like should we consider from
21:50 another lens um so it's really powerful
21:52 to bring together like that diversity of
21:54 voices and perspectives as we make a
21:57 plan that's the surface it looks a bit
21:59 complicated right because you have like
22:01 a lot
22:02 of functions who are not really
22:07 connected if you think about the
22:08 hierarchical structures but they still
22:11 have somehow work together and move to
22:14 the same direction uh and they somehow
22:17 need to agree what this direction is
22:19 right and there are many moving parts
22:21 and then the left hand sort of does not
22:23 always know what the right hand is doing
22:25 like uh is it the right like how did do
22:29 this even
22:31 work yeah um it it does require that
22:34 coordination together and I think um
22:37 maybe another aspect that I often take
22:38 into account with the designing a data
22:41 science or is that is that cross
22:43 functional alignment really at each
22:44 level of the organization so you know
22:46 for myself I should have a direct
22:48 product um engineering design research
22:52 partner um within each of the product
22:54 areas let's say it's the home timeline
22:58 the experience Etc the you know the data
23:01 science manager for that area has a
23:02 corresponding counterpart in each of the
23:04 functions and so that's kind of their
23:06 the regular group that they're um you
23:08 know working with on a a very frequent
23:10 regular basis um and then the individual
23:11 is also you know those teams okay so you
23:15 have to have this alignment on each
23:16 level so the individual contributors
23:19 have to align to agree with each other
23:21 what they work on then data science
23:23 manager has to agree with engineering
23:25 manager with product manager with uh I
23:27 don't know something else manager with
23:29 product analytics manager right and then
23:31 one level up we have heads off right so
23:33 they have to agree uh maybe the
23:35 direction is more broader and then you
23:38 as a director of data science need to
23:40 talk to director of product director of
23:42 analytics right and also think okay what
23:44 is the um like maybe here you more think
23:47 about strategy rather than like
23:49 particular details right and then you
23:50 have above you VPS right uh who also
23:55 need to
23:56 agree okay that does sound complex but
24:00 it works doesn't
24:02 it yeah I think um I think I've seen you
24:07 know overall like a shared interest
24:09 across the different functions and so
24:11 it's it doesn't feel necessarily like
24:13 there you know conflict or in terms of
24:16 priorities or directions we have a
24:17 shared set of goals um we do use the
24:20 objective and key result framework um I
24:23 had that kind of both at Microsoft and
24:25 at Twitter and so that's a really
24:26 unifying Factor where you're all working
24:28 towards um you know a common set of of
24:31 goals you've agreed on together um DS
24:33 plays a key role in terms of defining
24:35 those as well and then you know you have
24:37 your regular rhythms where you're
24:39 walking through and checking on your
24:40 progress or the is the direction that we
24:42 set out seem promising and showing
24:45 results are we executing well kind of
24:47 execution reviews and so these are all
24:49 ways that we can continue to stay in
24:50 synct and
24:52 aligned mhm yeah I'm taking a lot of
24:55 notes because I want to come back to
24:56 this and talk about that but I wanted to
25:00 also take a step back and again come
25:02 back to this centralized versus
25:04 decentralized I think we talked about
25:06 what we call Centralized right um but
25:10 yeah I also wanted to talk about this
25:11 decentralized part
25:14 so from what you describe it seems like
25:17 at Microsoft and at Twitter you more
25:20 have like a centralized approach right
25:23 or it's I mean I would say um maybe the
25:26 hybrid where it's centralized per
25:28 division um but there's multiple of them
25:31 across the the company um and with I
25:35 mean with Twitter being like a smaller
25:36 company than Microsoft there's fewer of
25:38 them and then um yeah Microsoft
25:41 essentially each of the product areas
25:44 has um has essential one for that
25:46 product
25:47 area so let's talk a bit about
25:50 decentralized one so what are the pros
25:52 and cons of having data scientist report
25:56 to engineering manager without having
25:58 data science manager head of data
26:00 science and so
26:01 on yeah so I mean often it comes about
26:04 again because the leader within that
26:06 group you know is they know that data
26:09 science is going to be a key function
26:10 for their success and so they they fund
26:13 um a certain number of roles um around
26:16 data science that are going to be fully
26:17 dedicated to the work that they do and
26:20 that like we were discussing before that
26:22 the data scientist gets all the context
26:25 and as well as the um in the context of
26:28 the domain that they're working on um
26:29 just immersively within the group and
26:32 then they also have a a group that's
26:34 there to directly act on um you know the
26:37 results of their work and so those are
26:39 some of the pros um I think you know
26:42 around the time when I wrote that
26:44 article I think one thing I was hearing
26:46 was you know folks that were working in
26:48 that model were often they would reach a
26:51 point where they would start seeking a a
26:53 broader data science or with where they
26:55 would have peers of data scientists that
26:57 they could work with together share more
27:00 of their ideas get feedback brainstorm
27:02 together work on more team projects
27:04 together across different data
27:06 scientists and then also in terms of
27:08 like career path um and mentorship and
27:13 just seeing like the the different
27:15 stages of career within the organization
27:16 that was attractive um regarding the you
27:19 know or maybe one thing that was more
27:21 challenging within um the other model
27:23 where you know if all their peers were
27:25 engineers maybe people didn't really
27:26 understand the nature of their craft as
27:28 well and maybe as you're having like a
27:30 end of year performance discussion it it
27:32 might be a little bit harder with that
27:34 manager to have all of the the context
27:36 and history about that specific um
27:39 career ladder um whereas if you're in
27:41 more of a peer group um there's a little
27:42 bit more of that default understanding
27:45 um by default um and then maybe some
27:47 natural different career stages that you
27:49 can um
27:50 experience and then I'm I was also
27:53 thinking
27:54 like I asked you in the centralized
27:58 way when everyone is taking care of
28:00 their own stuff there are too many
28:03 moving parts so here I guess one
28:05 advantage I don't know if it's an
28:06 advantage but this is
28:08 a like a key feature let's say that only
28:11 the engineer manager takes the decisions
28:14 or maybe the they have the product
28:16 counterparts or the em and PM they work
28:19 on this but it's fewer people who need
28:22 to take decision right so in case that
28:24 there is disagreement maybe it's easier
28:26 to well there are no disagreements
28:28 probably it's just okay we just do it
28:30 this way right while in the
28:33 other scenario you might have some
28:37 friction right might you might have
28:39 different views on the direction on how
28:43 to approach things right and it can be
28:46 both good and bad
28:48 right yeah I was just going to add that
28:50 point as well I think that can be both
28:52 good and bad you have
28:53 fewer um I guess um decision owner in
28:58 that sense so easier to make the call on
29:02 the direction but um but maybe you
29:04 actually do want that you know
29:05 additional leaders voice in the room if
29:08 you really want to make sure that the
29:10 the voice of data science is um you know
29:13 in those leadership forums and helping
29:15 set the direction and so um yeah to your
29:17 point it can it can be one more opinion
29:20 that maybe makes decision harder but
29:21 maybe it's actually hey to have that
29:23 today MH okay and what are the cons of
29:27 this centralized approach like what are
29:29 the
29:30 disadvantages yeah I think with the
29:32 centralized you just have to really make
29:34 a more concerted effort to one get the
29:37 context um so for example sometimes I
29:40 can hear from stakeholders of like
29:43 well data scientists seem more removed
29:46 or the work seems more academic I'm not
29:48 sure the direct application that's going
29:50 to have in my area and so the the data
29:51 scientists definitely need to um you
29:54 know grow that context um whether that's
29:57 through like
29:58 um you know using the product
30:01 um um researching the product um
30:04 understanding that the user research
30:06 kind of the work from the other
30:07 functions and um the the product road
30:09 map ahead so that they you know they're
30:12 kind of in The Forum discussing with
30:14 their Partners um you know the the ideas
30:17 ahead and then they can kind of go off
30:19 and have areas where they are doing D
30:22 data science blood projects um you know
30:24 ideas that they've come up on their own
30:25 but they they're applicable applicable
30:28 to the business where like you bring it
30:29 back to the stakeholder and say oh wow
30:30 this is you know very insightful this is
30:33 very useful I'm going to use it in this
30:34 way I wouldn't have thought about it but
30:36 now it's exactly what we need um and so
30:39 um it's just I guess really on the data
30:40 scientist to build that context in that
30:42 way um and then and then ensure that the
30:46 the product team is like at a place and
30:47 Engineering that they can act on it in
30:49 their road
30:51 map yeah so so this think you mentioned
30:54 uh like more academic more removed um I
30:57 I guess having these shared goals that
31:00 you mentioned like if you align on every
31:02 level if you U have these shared goals
31:06 on every level that kind of helps data
31:08 scientists to stay focused on the end
31:11 goal on the product rather than okay
31:13 what is the next paper I am going to
31:15 implement now and try right so like yeah
31:19 there's a few different yeah we talked
31:21 about the con there's a few different
31:22 factors that contribute there um you
31:24 know another one is just the way that
31:25 the data scientist team data science
31:27 team shares their work um you know the
31:30 the language that we use I think
31:32 whenever you're giving a a presentation
31:35 for example you always want to be
31:36 mindful of your audience and putting
31:38 things in their language and um context
31:41 and Framing and so you know um again
31:44 that's part of like you know building
31:46 that context so that you can help
31:47 position this within the plans but I
31:50 agree as you pointed out the the common
31:52 goals are a great way to um to frame
31:54 that and by the language I guess you
31:57 mean things like okay we improved our a
32:00 by 10% and now precision and recall are
32:03 better and like the audience and the
32:06 like who's watching this a you what
32:08 right uh so you need to to be able
32:12 to come down to their level I guess and
32:15 then explain things in other terms so
32:18 that they can relate and understand what
32:19 these numbers actually mean yeah find a
32:22 like find a Common Language or reference
32:26 I guess I don't usually use like the
32:27 going
32:28 up or down because again they're all
32:29 like equal partners and there you want
32:31 to find like a common language that
32:34 everyone has in their vocabulary and I
32:36 think um I find it's actually useful for
32:39 the data scientist as well as much as we
32:40 need to like distill our message into
32:43 the key takeaway like what's the Salient
32:46 statistic or data point that like really
32:48 lands the message of this broader you
32:50 know five-page paper that you wrote or
32:53 involved analysis like having to go
32:54 through that process of like writing the
32:56 exact summary and key takeaway
32:58 points often like requires some work but
33:00 it really crystallizes the the thought
33:02 and the the recommendation coming out of
33:05 the data
33:07 science and let's say we just want to
33:10 start with data science in our company
33:13 how do we select the right
33:17 approach sure um I mean I think you're
33:20 talking about just starting with data
33:21 science in the company then it um it
33:24 might also suggest something about just
33:25 like the size of the company as well I
33:28 think it's yeah I guess like a I don't
33:31 know a couple of hundred people not a
33:33 startup but not like a massive
33:36 organization either so yeah let's say
33:39 just a couple of hundred people
33:40 established product
33:42 um yeah something like that yeah no I
33:46 mean it's a good question I think I
33:49 guess as we've been discussing along the
33:51 way like there are pros and cons of each
33:52 approach I think typically as you're
33:54 starting off establishing the data
33:56 science Oregon fun within the group you
33:58 know there's going to be a lot of focus
33:59 on um establishing the pipelines like
34:03 setting the data engineering the the um
34:06 the architecture up front and then I
34:08 mean I feel like a lot of the initial
34:10 foundational work is essentially the the
34:13 counting just like getting the baselines
34:15 and the numbers it's really hard to do
34:16 much beyond that until you have like
34:18 that analytical foundation and then from
34:20 there um we can like continue to expand
34:24 the the data science um work and
34:27 opportunity but I think you know
34:28 establishing that core architecture
34:30 where you have reliable data clean data
34:34 um you know just the data quality
34:37 upfront um you know I think yeah you can
34:41 do that again within the respective
34:43 teams as they're focused on um data
34:45 science for their various areas but
34:47 there there is value in terms of
34:48 bringing that together so that you get
34:50 synergies efficiencies and you also have
34:53 um data from different parts of the
34:54 organization working together I guess
34:56 maybe that's one other point that I
34:58 should raise as we kind of discuss these
34:59 pros and cons is that if you have data
35:02 science fully um distributed you might
35:06 end up having like conflicting results
35:08 from different parts of the organization
35:10 that's it's not completely a nonissue in
35:12 the centralized data science org it's
35:13 something I still focus on with my org
35:15 as well I shouldn't have like one team
35:17 giving a conflicting recommendation to
35:18 the stakeholder than somebody else or
35:20 have us use um different approaches or
35:24 techniques but at least there's going to
35:25 Mor a forum to bring folks together um I
35:27 do recommend in the distributed model
35:29 even if you don't have that data science
35:31 reporting together that you know you
35:33 create more of a community so I think
35:34 that's a way that you simulate in that
35:36 model as well where you have maybe a
35:38 learning group or a show and share where
35:40 you kind of get together you share about
35:42 your work you get to hear feedback and
35:44 ideas from others on you know ways they
35:46 might approach it or things that they
35:47 would recommend to keep in
35:49 mind so what is said um first we need to
35:54 have the foundation like P pipelines
35:56 Analytics and then I guess this can also
35:59 be centralized right so you have like a
36:01 central um Team or whatever um function
36:05 that takes care of this and then once
36:07 this Foundation is ready then maybe you
36:09 can just get data scientists and start
36:12 placing them in this Central function
36:14 with data engineers and analysts and
36:17 then from there it will
36:19 grow like I guess you'll know
36:21 organically what is the best way for you
36:24 from there the the needs are and where
36:26 you see the highest leverag Investments
36:29 um you I think each period I'm often
36:31 reflecting about like the the work that
36:33 we did in different areas and where we
36:35 had the biggest impact and then kind of
36:37 like deeper invest in the areas where
36:39 you're um having an impact or where um
36:43 you know it aligns with the overall
36:44 strategy and direction of the company
36:46 and the
36:48 priorities and uh we have a question how
36:51 many data scientists will I need how to
36:54 estimate this before starting a project
36:57 yeah that's a good question um you know
36:59 there's a number of different ratios
37:00 used in the industry I think if you have
37:03 uh eight Engineers to one data scientist
37:06 that's kind of a reasonable place to
37:08 land and there's ranges you know higher
37:10 and lower than that but um it's a a
37:13 reasonable reference point now by
37:16 Engineers you mean front-end Engineers
37:18 backend Engineers data Engineers
37:20 everyone Engineers
37:21 right um no you're you're correct like
37:24 there might be some areas that um
37:27 require more data science than others so
37:29 I would say you know Engineers that that
37:34 um you know would you know that have um
37:37 direct scenarios that data scientists
37:39 can
37:40 influence but it has to be strictly more
37:43 than zero engineers in the team where
37:45 you hire data scientists
37:48 right um I would say likely yes yeah um
37:52 otherwise there would be no one to
37:55 really act on the that we do
37:58 yeah yeah and you know there are you
38:01 know a few different types of roles that
38:04 you could consider in between the
38:05 engineering and data science group like
38:06 there's the machine learning engineer
38:08 who is helping um you know develop the
38:13 models in production and so that's like
38:15 a very close partnership with the data
38:18 science team as well like we might
38:20 evaluate different signals in the models
38:23 different algorithms um looking at the
38:26 impact of different objective functions
38:28 things of that nature but then you know
38:29 there's a close partnership with that
38:31 the machine learning expert within the
38:32 engineering team as well so there's
38:34 maybe a few like graduated areas across
38:37 but yeah in terms of like it's the P um
38:40 software engineer coding I would say you
38:42 should have a non-zero
38:43 number yeah but I'm just wondering let's
38:46 take Twitter as an example I don't know
38:47 how it happened in Twitter but let's go
38:50 10 years back in time and then there was
38:53 probably time when people at Twitter
38:56 realized that chological sarting of the
38:59 feed maybe is not the best way of
39:01 showing things to people so let's have
39:04 franking there and they thought okay
39:06 like how many people do we actually need
39:08 Let's see we have 800 Engineers so we
39:10 can hire 100 data scientists to work on
39:12 this or probably it wasn't how it
39:14 happened right uh like how would you
39:18 yeah it wasn't exactly how it happened
39:20 but um I think that that is the that is
39:23 the discussion that we have today as
39:24 we're Staffing the teams I would say
39:26 like our engineering team is actually
39:27 very supportive of growing data science
39:29 they see the Direct Value and benefits
39:32 they get to use so often they'll
39:33 actually fund the um headcount within
39:36 the data science organization and and we
39:38 do use things like those ratios to you
39:41 know just give us a reasonable reference
39:42 point as we do the planning across the
39:44 organization and also as we're comparing
39:46 how we're staffed across different team
39:47 areas um but no yeah it didn't exactly
39:52 happen that way I think for the data
39:54 science team you know it's something
39:56 that we need to
39:58 consistently advocate for not from just
40:00 a you know growing an Empire of the org
40:03 but really just from a standpoint of
40:05 like how can we have critical mass to be
40:07 able to engage on the depth of that
40:10 level within each area if you if you
40:12 have a very thin data signs or it's just
40:14 hard to get very deep in terms of like
40:16 the the strategy and Direction you have
40:17 to either just choose hey we're gonna
40:20 we're going to have data science on some
40:22 areas and just zero on others so we can
40:24 really have like the quality engagement
40:25 that um you you know and and want or you
40:28 end up just spreading so thin that
40:30 you're just kind of covering Basic
40:32 Ground in terms of helping helping the
40:34 business see you know how how we're
40:36 tracking or progressing but um yeah hard
40:38 to have kind of like the level of depth
40:40 of analysis is to really recommend the
40:41 strategy in Direction mhm yeah I'm just
40:45 trying to kind of understand and
40:47 summarize that uh because see there was
40:50 a lot of information and uh so thin here
40:53 means that um like how much ground the
40:56 data science
40:57 part covers like and theme meaning that
40:59 maybe there are not so many data
41:01 scientists and then they do pretty much
41:03 everything they take care of many many
41:06 domains rather than and then non would
41:09 be like when they go deeper in one of
41:12 the areas for example I don't know ads
41:15 so then there is a team who focuses
41:18 exclusively on ads right and then would
41:20 be the opposite of fin right um correct
41:24 yeah and I'm kind of even thinking like
41:26 I think ads is fairly broad but even to
41:29 kind of like a more specific level if
41:32 you can have um let's see some good
41:35 examples here
41:38 um yeah like there's a number of
41:41 different um content creation forms
41:44 there's um spaces there's communities if
41:47 you you know if you just have one data
41:48 scientist across all these different
41:49 areas the amount of time that they have
41:50 to spend just getting context getting to
41:52 know the data sets is is going to be
41:54 like a pretty high proportion of their
41:56 time and so be able to share General
41:59 insights um just within those areas but
42:01 in terms of like really being able to go
42:03 deep in that strategy and um and have
42:06 the close partnership with like each
42:08 individual product leader it's a little
42:10 bit more
42:11 limited yeah I got a bit distracted
42:13 sorry I post my thought our future data
42:16 scientist in the
42:17 room probably okay U I'll ask another
42:21 question so the question is I'm
42:23 interested what happens when data
42:25 scientist finds a huge Discovery in data
42:27 to whom do they report these findings is
42:30 it head of data science is it PM is it
42:32 po engineering manager somebody in the
42:35 team somebody up in the
42:38 hierarchy yeah I mean all all the above
42:40 I would say like um you know we we try
42:43 to share within the data science
42:45 organization first or frequently because
42:48 that's where you know I mentioned we we
42:50 try to share the approaches and findings
42:52 that they're not conflicting and there's
42:53 opportunity to um you know have
42:56 different question and ideas and ensure
42:59 that you know as we bring those
43:00 perspectives together we we give our
43:02 most wellfound recommendations so we
43:04 usually have some Forum within the DS
43:05 team where we get to share either the
43:06 work in progress or the final result but
43:09 um communicating the the results of our
43:12 work is like a huge topic it at both
43:15 companies I've worked at you know we've
43:16 had different publishing forums you
43:18 always want to have an archive where you
43:20 can find the um the research that the
43:23 team has had over the years and so some
43:25 kind of like searchable um um site where
43:29 you can search at all the research for
43:31 specific areas or across the teams um
43:33 that's really important for like
43:35 knowledge share and transfer and
43:37 institutional knowledge over time as
43:39 folks are onboarding Etc but then you
43:40 also need like a a push mechanism um
43:43 with it to each of the folks that we
43:44 were discussing um whether here you know
43:47 we have like a slack Channel that's
43:49 about how we share ongoing insights we
43:50 have one for DS and one for for research
43:52 because we really like to think about
43:53 like the Quant and call insights
43:56 holistically together we're we're
43:57 gaining our user and product
43:59 understanding um but yeah we we point
44:02 them out on a frequent basis within like
44:04 the live forums that we have the
44:05 synchronous as well as the asynchronous
44:07 whether it's a newsletter or an email or
44:11 updates that we share so I think for any
44:13 function like you know the say it say it
44:16 again and then say it again you have to
44:17 kind of it feels like you're overc
44:19 communicating but often there's you know
44:21 folks across the organization that just
44:23 don't know about um this and I think you
44:25 know for everyone to be well educated
44:27 inverse within our data is really
44:29 critical for all the roles um but of
44:31 course you can prioritize within all the
44:33 folks you're communicating to you know
44:35 once you go through that DS round then
44:37 you know speaking making sure that you
44:39 speak directly with the folks who are
44:40 going to be able to act on this um it's
44:42 probably who I would prioritize in that
44:45 list so who who this thing affects most
44:50 right is it does it affect the user
44:52 experience and maybe go talk to
44:54 researchers right on product managers or
44:57 or is it like an error in dat then go
44:59 talk to date Engineers right or is it a
45:01 new Al go to researchers parameter tun
45:05 you're going to work directly with the
45:06 engineering team who's going to actually
45:08 make that change in the the code if it's
45:11 um yeah if it's something about the the
45:13 user experience that you explore like an
45:15 insight about how users are actually
45:17 engaging with the product or experiment
45:19 that we launched and kind of the the
45:20 findings based on that then um maybe
45:23 you'll be talking with someone who's
45:24 designing that experience more whether
45:26 that's product or
45:28 design just one click
45:47 on
45:48 sorry yeah it's fun working from home
45:51 right yes is TT
45:54 fully um it is currently
45:58 yes um I we have um we do have offices
46:02 in different cities um so I have a local
46:05 office that I I go totime butar now yeah
46:09 but you still can work from home if you
46:11 want right
46:12 yeah okay yeah there is something else I
46:15 wanted to talk about which is I took a
46:17 look at your LinkedIn and then what you
46:19 do at Twitter and then I took a look at
46:21 one of the paragraphs you wrote there
46:24 and it says part three closely with
46:27 product management engineering design
46:29 research to pursue datadriven product
46:32 Innovation and achieving strategic goals
46:34 so this is quite a packed sentence to me
46:37 so this is a short sentence but there is
46:40 a lot in this sentence so yeah I wanted
46:43 to spend uh some time trying to
46:47 understand what it means and decompose
46:50 it so yeah I wanted to start with the
46:54 first thing here so partnering
46:56 partnering closely with product
46:57 management so how important it is to
47:00 closely to partner with
47:03 them um it's essential yeah I think we
47:07 kind of as we've been discussing we need
47:08 to partner closely with um you know
47:12 product and Engineering in order for any
47:14 of the the work that we do to actually
47:16 see life and make a difference um and be
47:19 acted on because I guess the product
47:22 managers at least in my experience these
47:25 are the people who actually know what is
47:27 important for the user so they are kind
47:29 of the most important uh stakeholders
47:32 right so they show you the direction and
47:35 then it's up to you to understand how to
47:37 implement this so they say users have
47:40 this problem and you need as a data
47:44 scientist as a director of data science
47:46 you need to think okay how can I use now
47:49 data science to actually solve this
47:50 problem and then you run this by product
47:52 managers and ask okay do you think this
47:54 is something that will help right and
47:56 this is this is the kind of U
47:59 conversation you have with them right to
48:01 understand really where to go so the
48:03 strategy part comes from them right the
48:05 problems come from them and then you are
48:07 more like the
48:08 solution um maybe yes no so like so I
48:12 would say that the product the product
48:14 function is you know um like the de
48:18 facto leader for that overall road map I
48:20 think maybe going back to the the
48:22 co-owner I think that's why we developed
48:25 that term because the the strategy we
48:27 really want like all the functions to
48:29 feel responsible for contributing to
48:31 that but it's true that the the product
48:33 team is the one who's really bringing
48:34 that together and um you know
48:37 communicating that in a holistic way and
48:40 driving that really for the the broader
48:42 team and so um yeah so we'll we'll work
48:45 across the functions to discuss that
48:47 strategy you know product will we'll
48:50 capture it and bring that together and
48:52 um really take the lead on that um um
48:55 and then driving that forward and then
48:57 you know I think a number of the types
48:59 of interactions that come up come up for
49:01 example between product and DS will be
49:03 okay we we've decided that we're going
49:05 to take this strategy and Direction what
49:07 is the best way to measure success so
49:09 then the data science team will be the
49:11 driver or the owner for that and you
49:13 know product will prove it to kind of
49:15 confirm okay that is capturing you know
49:17 the goal or the intent of of what we had
49:19 in mind here um then we'll also have
49:22 things like okay that's our overall um
49:25 success or measure
49:37 of have the the desirable changes and
49:40 that can be its own data science project
49:42 in itself to find those um causal
49:45 indicators as well um there are other
49:48 engagements that come up around
49:50 experimentation um what are the um the
49:53 ship criteria for for changes that put
49:56 into place so for example um you know I
49:59 think both companies we've had a way to
50:02 um you know run experiments like
50:04 holistically and have a view that all
50:06 functions can use to look at the results
50:07 of the experiments and the the way the
50:10 different metrics move like if one
50:11 metric goes up and another one goes down
50:13 the data science team is responsible for
50:16 um establishing what is the the
50:18 recommended trade-off across these when
50:20 it comes into guard rails um and things
50:23 of that nature and then the then you
50:26 have of a model for doing the experiment
50:27 review across the functions to to
50:30 interpret that and you know generally
50:31 you're following that but you can also
50:32 have room for interpretation based on
50:34 the specific um scenario that was
50:36 launched and what's appropriate there um
50:39 so yeah those are a few examples I think
50:40 of like that data science and product
50:43 interaction do you have uh product
50:45 analysts or it's mostly data scientists
50:47 who do
50:48 analytics um we we also have um analysts
50:51 within the
50:52 team so this is analysts they are kind
50:56 of the part of the data science team
50:57 because to me all you described not all
51:00 but some of these like uh analyzing
51:02 metrics and uh you know looking at uh
51:06 how these metrics uh conflict with each
51:09 other um this is something that tels
51:11 typically do right or this is more like
51:13 what data scientists do um no it's a
51:17 good it's a good point regarding um kind
51:18 of the further differentiation between
51:20 the roles there I think you know our
51:23 analysts have been
51:25 um really driving a lot of the um data
51:28 democratization for these metrics so as
51:30 the metrics are developed you know
51:33 putting those in a um a dashboard or a
51:37 discoverable environment that everyone
51:38 can use to track and um really leading a
51:41 lot of the descriptive work like what
51:44 has occurred um some of these um like
51:48 determining what the the leading
51:50 indicators are like do require various
51:52 um DS analyses and so there is like an
51:55 interaction that occurs there and then I
51:57 would say like depending on the nature
51:59 of the product area like there are also
52:02 some very um like ml heavy areas let's
52:07 say that's like the home timeline
52:08 ranking feed for example whereas the
52:10 data scientists is engaging more there
52:12 it does require like a deeper um data
52:15 science construct to be able to engage
52:17 with both product on kind of the the
52:19 road mapap for that area as well as you
52:21 know maybe getting into how DS is
52:23 engaging with the engineering team there
52:25 they're a little bit more focused in
52:26 those algorithms as well mhm yeah and U
52:31 so I think we talked about like how do
52:33 you uh partner with them and the
52:36 examples I think it also comes back a
52:39 little bit when we talked about goal
52:41 setting and uh objectives and key
52:43 results and so on is it essentially the
52:46 main tool that you use for partnering
52:49 with engineering product design and
52:50 research like all these goal setting
52:52 Frameworks and then alignments or there
52:54 is more to that
52:57 um I would say that that is a key um
53:00 kind of Cornerstone of that alignment
53:02 because I think you know as you have a
53:04 set of shared goals and common interest
53:06 across the team everything else kind of
53:08 Falls from there whether that's um you
53:11 know resourcing the types of projects
53:13 that you take on um I guess one family
53:16 we didn't really discuss is also just
53:17 the you know we try to have a set of
53:19 time that the data science team can have
53:22 to just Explore More broadly like the
53:24 user behavior and new insights that
53:26 actually recommend what is the next um
53:28 thing we should pursue on the product
53:30 road map and so um I I think having that
53:33 common view of the goals and success
53:35 again are that common con context to
53:37 make sure that that doesn't just come
53:39 out of left field and seem like
53:40 something that's not as relevant like
53:42 it's a way to see that oh we we all have
53:44 a agreed upon view of you know what
53:46 we're trying to drive as terms of
53:48 success um and then can move towards
53:50 that model and then maybe just keeping
53:52 like various you know communication
53:53 forums whether that's synchronous or
53:55 asynchronous so that we're um reflecting
53:59 together I think as we go through those
54:01 processes we have um postm morms or
54:03 retrospectives whatever um term you you
54:06 prefer to say okay what you know this
54:08 was our goal this was what we tried what
54:10 worked what didn't work what can we
54:12 learn from this for next
54:14 time How often it happens uh maybe not
54:18 specifically at Twitter but just in your
54:20 experience um that in this kind of setup
54:24 uh different functions have con conflict
54:27 goals so let's say data science wants to
54:30 go more in data science while I don't
54:33 know in uh in the product area backend
54:36 Engineers uh they want to spend more I
54:39 don't know on other things um let's say
54:43 I don't know decoupling like working on
54:46 uh you know removing technical debt
54:49 while data scientists need actually
54:51 Engineers to help them with some of the
54:53 stuff and then you have this natural
54:54 conflict right so because want to spend
54:57 time on this thing and data science
54:59 wants them to spend time on other things
55:01 and now you need to decide what you do
55:03 in the next quarter uh and I guess this
55:06 situation happens quite often right so
55:07 how do you uh resolve these little
55:11 conflicts yeah I think that um data
55:14 science actually has a really key role
55:16 in in in driving those discussions um
55:19 for example we've had several like
55:21 strategy discussions in the past
55:22 organizational discussions where if you
55:25 can have everybody looking at the common
55:26 data around like what the relative
55:28 opportunity sizing is for example across
55:30 these opportunities been um then
55:33 establishes Common Grounds but we can
55:35 you know all all prioritize this from a
55:37 common lens so basically you convince
55:40 with data see what will happen if we do
55:43 X right and then everyone wow that's so
55:45 cool let's drop everything and do this
55:47 right
55:48 exactly okay and then yeah uh and coming
55:53 back to this sentence um so partnering
55:56 closely with product management
55:58 management engineering design and
55:59 research we covered that to pursue
56:02 datadriven product Innovation so what is
56:05 datadriven product Innovation is this uh
56:08 thing we just discussed like this is
56:11 what happens if we do X and then
56:12 everyone is wow let's do
56:15 this um yeah essentially it's you know
56:18 really looking to learn and um you know
56:22 guide the product from from the data and
56:24 so I think like the best
56:26 um cultures or environments for data
56:29 Sciences you know when you have teams
56:31 that are really open to and curious to
56:33 learn from from the data in that way um
56:36 versus having like maybe an an
56:38 attachment to a certain um you know idea
56:42 or product design um really being able
56:44 to view it objectively across the group
56:46 and then use data to track our our
56:49 progress and you know check our our
56:52 hypotheses um and have that guiding for
56:55 us yeah mhm so the main part here is
56:58 having trust in your data and then being
57:01 able to use this data to show okay this
57:03 is the direction we should go and this
57:05 is the new cool thing we should try
57:07 because it probably will affect this and
57:10 then this is how you do datadriven
57:11 product Innovation right and then
57:14 checking and you know validating that
57:16 along the way yeah of course of course
57:18 uh yeah I think we should be prepping up
57:21 um so let me check if there are any
57:23 questions that I missed uh no I think my
57:27 YouTube chat doesn't work so I don't see
57:30 any questions and one one point I'll
57:31 just mention because you were talking
57:32 about partnering across the functions um
57:34 research is also an interesting one
57:36 where we really try to do joint research
57:38 together across the um you know more of
57:40 the the user studies and qualitative
57:42 research as well as the data science um
57:45 research and so you know sometimes they
57:47 can spark each can spark ideas for the
57:49 other like maybe through research we
57:51 might hear things that give us ideas of
57:53 different data sets to explore um or to
57:55 kind of understand see how
57:56 representative it is across the data and
57:58 then um research as well can kind of
58:00 take the the data findings and then you
58:03 know try to understand a little bit more
58:04 the why or the psychology behind it what
58:06 users are thinking or feeling when they
58:09 when they that way yeah okay so the
58:11 audience of this podcast of these events
58:13 are mostly data scientists I assume or
58:16 data Fox um so is there one single thing
58:19 you can recommend them to do if they
58:21 work with uh researchers to learn from
58:25 them to
58:26 you know do what you just said like to
58:29 uh get inspiration from them is there
58:32 something they can do to you know learn
58:34 from
58:35 them yeah I mean I think um just keeping
58:37 an open mind and Curiosity on kind of
58:40 what they're finding and seeing I think
58:42 one challenge that we can have from data
58:44 scientists when we're viewing research
58:46 studies is that you know the sample
58:47 sizes are often smaller than what we're
58:49 accustomed to so I think it's really
58:50 easy to say oh well that's not you know
58:53 we don't know how representative that is
58:55 ETC and you know just the power of you
58:57 test right exactly just trying to kind
59:00 of take that lens of like well what
59:01 could I learn from this maybe if that's
59:03 not um you know in the
59:06 full proportionate like context like
59:08 maybe I can take that idea and then I
59:10 can go study in the data and see how um
59:13 representative it is or can we set up
59:14 the study in a way so that like
59:17 anonymized and following LPI by users we
59:19 can kind of confirm that okay we have a
59:21 certain cohort within each of the
59:23 representative cohorts certain um you
59:26 know representive sample within each of
59:27 the cohorts we were interested to study
59:29 so I think there are a few ways to to
59:31 bridge that um but yeah I would say just
59:33 kind of you trying to to take a lens of
59:35 what we can learn from
59:37 it if somebody wants to find you and ask
59:40 a question what is the best way of doing
59:42 this is it Twitter or some other place
59:46 yeah I think I think you've shared on
59:47 the um on the podcast my my Twitter
59:50 handle um LinkedIn um either of those
59:52 work as well okay great uh
59:56 did I did you maybe also want to mention
59:59 something but didn't have a chance
1:00:02 to um this is great yeah know I love the
1:00:05 conversation thank you for driving
1:00:07 through all the different topics and
1:00:08 exploring here so yeah great to chat
1:00:11 with you it was my pleasure thanks uh
1:00:14 thanks for joining us and thanks
1:00:15 everyone for joining us as well and
1:00:17 asking questions watching the interview
1:00:19 that was great and U yeah enjoy your
1:00:24 weekend great thanks
1:00:26 he
