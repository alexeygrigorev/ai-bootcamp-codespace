1:06 okay you're ready
1:08 yeah
1:09 okay
1:11 so this week we'll talk about the role
1:13 of a staff AI engineer and we have a
1:15 special guest today Tatiana Tatiana
1:17 works as a staff engineer at LinkedIn
1:19 before that she worked in physics and in
1:21 healthcare
1:22 it's actually not the first time that
1:24 Yana is a guest here in this podcast
1:27 around two years maybe slightly less I
1:30 don't remember we already talked with
1:32 her and the topic there was
1:35 um changing her years from Academia from
1:37 physics to machine learning and now
1:41 after two years we again have Tina
1:44 Tatiana and we will speak about the
1:47 stuff role so welcome welcome again
1:50 thank you thank you for inviting
1:53 so before we go into our main topic of
1:55 being a staff engineer let's start with
1:57 your background we already spoke about
1:59 your background years ago but maybe you
2:01 can run us through again and then also
2:04 tell us what also happened in the last
2:07 two years
2:09 yeah so I started my career with PhD in
2:12 physics and I worked for a while
2:14 developing lasers and Optical systems
2:16 then on maternity list I got quite
2:18 interested in machine learning field
2:20 which was new back then so I started to
2:23 do pet projects and card link and doing
2:27 some research my own research and
2:29 Publishing papers and machine learning
2:31 and after maternity leave I moved to
2:34 health care when I was working on
2:36 computer aided diagnostic tool for labor
2:39 monitoring and at that point we talked
2:41 uh almost two years ago
2:43 after one year of work in the hospital I
2:47 started to go through interviews to
2:49 different companies big tech companies
2:51 different startups remote works and so
2:54 on and started to work as a tackle it at
2:58 LinkedIn so after some difficult Choice
3:01 choose LinkedIn where I worked for the
3:04 last one year and a half and that's been
3:07 like pretty much all the news for the
3:08 last two years but I learned a ton
3:10 because it's a new industry a new
3:12 environment
3:13 thank you
3:15 yeah that was pretty concise
3:24 so I'm just curious It's probably two
3:27 different worlds or even three different
3:29 worlds like Academia then working uh at
3:31 a hospital and then working at a big
3:33 tech company right so it's like all
3:36 three
3:37 are very different so how how was it for
3:40 you like when you from a hospital when
3:42 you joined uh LinkedIn a big tech
3:45 company
3:46 how was it for you overwhelming yes
3:49 it was transformational it was
3:51 overwhelming in the first three months
3:53 of on boarding I was working about 80
3:55 hours
3:56 70 80 hours a week be kudos to my
4:00 husband who understood that I needed
4:01 that time so he was helping with kids a
4:04 lot when I was just studying in in new
4:06 milks
4:08 yes it was like a big challenge but also
4:11 a big shift is in a mindset so when you
4:14 work in Academia and also hospital is
4:17 quite close to Academia your timeline is
4:20 a bit different your plan projects for
4:22 one two years you are not in a hurry you
4:25 are like relaxed you don't have that
4:27 many meetings so you really learn it in
4:30 Academia a bunch of skills of effective
4:33 communication of a fast pace of making
4:38 planning quarterly on delivering results
4:40 faster so what you do in Academia for
4:43 during the year you you need to
4:45 accomplish during three months and
4:47 things like that and when you have a
4:49 meetings in Academia people talk like
4:51 they have all the time in the world
4:54 so for for one hour you can have a
4:56 meeting without that much outcome and in
4:58 Industry you have 20 minutes meetings
5:01 you have to decide what you're going to
5:03 do then the next 10 minutes meetings 30
5:05 minutes meetings and so on
5:07 so you learn a lot on collaboration
5:09 communication prioritization and so on
5:13 and yeah but that was very useful
5:18 like 80 hours a week that's insane like
5:21 why did you need to
5:23 um why did you need to put so much
5:25 effort there like I guess at the
5:27 beginning it was just too difficult to
5:28 overwhelming so you needed to put extra
5:31 effort into catching up with everything
5:34 I think yes it's uh well it's it's not
5:38 that I always work 80 hours a week it's
5:40 not possible but at the beginning you
5:42 had right yeah in the beginning I
5:43 realized that I came and I realized that
5:46 okay scholar spark I never thought of
5:48 that kubernetes so a lot of internal
5:51 tools that I never used and you also
5:55 attacked it so you actually don't have
5:58 that much on boarding and relaxing
6:00 boarding you are a tech lead and you
6:01 actually lead others so you already need
6:04 to deliver some design of the new system
6:07 uh at scale and that you're never
6:10 delivered at this scale like for
6:12 recommendation systems for 80 million
6:15 users it's not something that I was
6:16 doing before but I was attacked so all
6:19 decisions uh were on my side so to make
6:22 those decisions
6:23 I had to learn a lot how other companies
6:26 do it read a lot of blog posts papers as
6:29 well at the same time learning all those
6:31 tools that I never used
6:34 uh yes and I guess I was just
6:36 overwhelmed so I tried to do my best to
6:39 catch up if I had to do it second time I
6:43 would say myself take it easy it's okay
6:44 they give you time you're not supposed
6:46 to deliver results in the first two
6:48 months it's okay but I think I was so
6:51 much worrying that I wouldn't be
6:54 effective enough
6:55 that I worked extra mile now I know that
6:59 I could have taken it easier and to take
7:02 my time to learn
7:04 yeah that's pretty interesting I want to
7:06 ask you more about the tools and like
7:09 how you approach this learning but
7:11 before that I think it would be
7:12 interesting to know what tech leads do
7:15 what staff Engineers do you mentioned
7:18 that you need to read others you need to
7:20 Design Systems you need to make
7:23 decisions right so how like what does
7:26 your day look like what kind of things
7:28 you need to do yeah okay so in short uh
7:31 I'll tell like that I'm paid for my
7:33 opinion that's a shot so now in details
7:37 as a staff engineer there are different
7:39 kind of Staff Engineers
7:42 particularly our team is horizontal team
7:44 it means that you have a lot of internal
7:48 stakeholders in different orgs and that
7:51 means a lot of
7:52 interactions with different teams with
7:55 products with data scientists with other
7:58 teams within the teachers with legal
7:59 team and so on so like almost half of my
8:04 work are different meetings and
8:05 interactions
8:06 and you are liar lies in on strategy you
8:11 are defining reward map for a set of
8:13 projects uh you agree with other leaders
8:17 and a line on different cross
8:21 cross-functional collaborations
8:23 different projects you also own the
8:27 delivery of the results and their impact
8:29 so a lot of work goes into that meetings
8:32 on alignment and defining the roadmap
8:35 and strategy and what you're going to do
8:38 and defining the objective both business
8:40 and Technical goals basically you
8:43 collaborate with products a lot on that
8:46 um on the technical side you also Mentor
8:50 a lot of people not only in your
8:52 immediate team but across different
8:53 teams as well
8:55 you work with ML Engineers annotators
8:59 engineering linguists data scientists UI
9:02 engineers and you supervise them all to
9:05 make sure that the project is delivered
9:07 on time
9:08 you are part of promo committees and
9:11 hiring committees when you review the
9:14 work of the others you
9:17 do as
9:19 as AI technical stuff you do a lot of
9:23 machine learning design obviously if you
9:25 are like uh stuff in some other like
9:29 infrastructure you you probably work on
9:31 system design more so a lot of work is
9:33 dedicated to creating uh designs and
9:36 also reviewing designs of the others
9:39 so when people do some designs that has
9:43 to be reviewed and often staff is the
9:46 person who is pulled in to get the
9:48 opinion you also do a lot of code
9:50 reviews so people who work with you
9:53 write code and you review it for your
9:55 team and also outside your team you
9:58 don't write much of the code I still try
10:00 to keep hands on so I dedicate myself
10:03 one day a week to write chords that's my
10:05 choice basically but most of the time
10:07 you don't really write the code and
10:10 there are some stuffs who don't write
10:11 any code and there are some stuff people
10:13 who write more quotes depends on what
10:16 kind of stuff you are as well and as for
10:19 me I write a lot of docs obviously and a
10:22 lot of plants and Droid Maps and
10:26 every every everything needs a dog if
10:30 you have a legal alignment for example
10:32 you need to document it and things like
10:34 that
10:35 and
10:37 yeah that's pretty much
10:40 all the pillars so designing systems
10:43 mentoring others
10:45 giving your opinion improving
10:47 craftsmanship of the team and outside
10:49 your team defining strategy defined and
10:52 roadmap and making sure that the bigger
10:55 projects involved in many teams go to
10:57 production and they make an impact
11:00 I had a lot for one person isn't it well
11:04 you are more like leading that so you
11:08 don't do that all yourself right people
11:10 who Implement things work with you so
11:12 and you collaborate with products as
11:16 well who who do Define what business
11:19 input to expect and things like that and
11:21 you collaborate with legal team who is
11:23 advising you what you can and cannot do
11:26 things like that so but yes it's uh it's
11:30 a lot of coordinations and meetings you
11:32 can in a weekly basis you can meet like
11:34 you know five to ten different teams and
11:37 with different people so
11:40 um again this is across team
11:42 collaboration type of stuff when you
11:45 have a lot of cross-team collaborations
11:46 so that's my role there are also
11:49 different types of stuff people who for
11:51 example there are people who have uh
11:54 very great technical expertise and they
11:57 know some particular narrow fields or
12:00 not necessarily narrow field very well
12:03 and they are pulled into troubleshooting
12:05 so if there is a critical problem and
12:07 something does not work they are pulled
12:10 into some of the problem like fire fire
12:12 fighting the created this there are
12:16 people who have a great depths and
12:19 widths of some field for example machine
12:21 learning they act as advisors to the
12:24 leadership so they're like personal
12:25 advisor on the technical side so it's
12:28 this kind of stuff and so there are
12:32 different uh there are people who have
12:34 very great expertise compared to the
12:37 others so the mentor and teach others
12:41 this expertise and focus more on
12:43 Hands-On so they create a lot of
12:45 Leverage by actually coding but that's
12:47 not very common not uh usually all the
12:50 staff are doing a lot of coding it
12:52 depends on the role so if you're a
12:54 horizontal team and you have a lot of
12:56 different interactions
12:58 um you are not paid for accordingly are
13:00 more paid for your opinion and making
13:02 decisions and realizing all this and
13:04 defining roadmap although you can I'm
13:07 still trying to to be involved in coded
13:10 myself not only review but most of the
13:12 code I don't try it I reviewed
13:15 like one to ten I'd say to to each one
13:18 submission that I do I I review ten
13:20 something like that
13:24 so just to summarize what you said there
13:26 are multiple kinds of stuff Engineers
13:30 staff level people
13:33 um or profiles or I think I figured the
13:36 word archetypes
13:38 um yes so the what you do is
13:40 collaboration and coordination work
13:44 right then there is uh like somebody who
13:48 has great deep technical expertise so
13:51 they
13:52 are put in when there is a problem in
13:55 some specific area and they help solve
13:57 it and then there are people who have
13:59 broad expertise so they act as advisors
14:02 right didn't miss anything it was Broad
14:04 and deep in some area yes they can be or
14:08 it's one person right so deep in one and
14:11 brought in others
14:13 who managed to have boss so
14:19 I guess yeah it's like this t-shaped
14:21 profile right yes so yeah there is a
14:25 book uh I think it's called staff
14:27 engineer pass which defines those
14:30 archetypes quite well
14:32 so and I quite agree with that
14:34 definitions I read that book and yes
14:36 it's
14:38 so yeah
14:41 okay so you're paid for your opinion you
14:44 spent 50 time in meetings and then like
14:48 you define you work on strategy Define
14:50 roadmaps then you also Mentor people
14:54 that take part in design decisions
14:58 and you mentioned that at the beginning
15:00 you needed to work like 70 80 hours
15:02 because I guess for you it was many of
15:05 these things were difficult right so you
15:07 you weren't certain that your design
15:10 decisions are good so that you wanted to
15:12 improve your skills did they understand
15:14 it correctly
15:16 I wanted to like some of that was very
15:19 well transferred from okay
15:21 for example all this communication
15:22 collaboration roadmap strategy it's
15:25 exactly how you define your research
15:28 proposal you write a plan for two years
15:30 you define goals your liar lies with
15:32 different teams and so on mentoring a
15:35 big part of academic work so nothing
15:39 changed there but I did not work in NLP
15:43 before and I did not work exactly with
15:45 this type of recommendation systems at
15:48 that scale so that was a big part of
15:50 learning so I took a couple of courses
15:52 both on NLP and recommendation systems
15:55 but I also read a lot in blog posts and
15:58 in papers that other companies publish
16:01 and also a big part of learning
16:05 was internal tools you can't learn them
16:09 outside pretty much you can but they're
16:12 not that common outside so you learn a
16:15 lot those internal tools and plus I did
16:17 not work with uh skull spark before so
16:21 and with kubernetes I did not work
16:22 before there were also some gaps because
16:25 I never worked as a software engineer
16:27 so I had probably a little bit more gaps
16:30 in the technical part but a little bit
16:32 fewer in strategy and communication
16:35 thanks to Katina
16:37 how did you approach learning how did
16:39 you know what next to learn did you
16:42 create a plan and follow this plan did
16:44 you ask your colleagues for their advice
16:46 or how did you do this
16:48 so yeah my unborn was rather hectic I
16:51 was just
16:52 learning whatever I could without you
16:55 know proper understanding what to
16:57 prioritize so in the beginning you're
17:00 overwhelmed simply because you don't
17:02 know what you need to prioritize and how
17:05 so if I had to do it second time I would
17:07 understand better and that wouldn't
17:10 require that much time so yeah basically
17:13 taking one course after the other end
17:16 without clear understanding what is more
17:18 important at this very moment I only
17:21 regardless understanding in about two
17:22 three months so that that sounds very
17:25 overwhelming right trying to you know
17:28 learn everything at the same time uh or
17:30 at least one after another how would you
17:33 suggest like let's say if you could give
17:37 a piece of advice to yourself in the
17:39 past what would it be like how would you
17:42 suggest yourself in the past to approach
17:44 this
17:45 yes that's a good question so onboarding
17:49 is always a challenge
17:51 and unborn in every companies
17:54 definitely is a challenge so I would
17:57 find more mentors from the start and
18:00 just to ask
18:01 to help with this technical plan in fact
18:05 I had a mentor but immediately he went
18:08 to a parental leave so and that's why I
18:11 did not had a mentor and such an unborn
18:14 usually in onboarding process you have a
18:17 mentor who helps you and who guides you
18:19 and after that we spent quite a Time
18:23 developing our onboarding for the next
18:25 Engineers so they will not be
18:27 overwhelmed hopefully that worked better
18:31 and
18:32 so that's number one find mentors
18:35 immediately and ask also communicate
18:39 with your manager all the time about
18:41 priorities
18:42 and expectations and don't feel urged to
18:46 deliver something in production in the
18:48 first two months it's okay you have your
18:50 time turn board
18:53 in a big tech company of course if
18:55 you're in a startup you need to deliver
18:56 by the end of the week
18:59 no pressure
19:04 depends on the size of the company then
19:06 worry yeah maybe startups don't really
19:09 need this kind of profiles like they
19:12 don't need somebody who is coordinating
19:14 because if it's just I don't know one or
19:15 two teams then uh people can just talk
19:18 to each other without this special role
19:22 probably
19:23 okay and I know that you joined LinkedIn
19:27 LinkedIn as a staff engineer after
19:29 working in healthcare
19:32 and you managed to skip
19:34 like a few roles before stuff so I know
19:36 the usual career progression is uh you
19:39 join a company as a junior then
19:41 there are Juniors there are middle level
19:44 uh professionals and there are seniors
19:46 and then only after that staff engineers
19:50 and you from what I understood didn't
19:53 have experience in a in industry
19:57 yet you didn't join uh LinkedIn as a
20:00 middle level engineer or senior engineer
20:03 you joined it immediately as a staff
20:04 engineer and then wondering how did this
20:07 happen how did you manage to
20:09 kind of jump over these roles before and
20:11 join and land a pretty high level
20:14 position
20:20 I think that whenever you you start in
20:22 your career you have to start with a
20:24 junior level this is not correct so it's
20:26 not that I did not head my career before
20:28 I actually had PhD in physics and then I
20:31 worked in
20:32 science for I don't know six years or so
20:35 leading my own projects like a research
20:37 fellow so when your principal
20:39 investigator in science what you do is
20:42 the following you come up with idea of a
20:45 project that nobody on Earth ever done
20:47 before
20:48 you need to find Partners to make this
20:52 happen so you need to find a host
20:54 Institute who has enough equipment
20:56 partner institutes industrial Partners
20:58 like ideally five different
21:00 organizations across the globe you need
21:03 to write a proposal when you put your
21:04 plan
21:05 implementation plan your cell motivation
21:08 when you need to do that you you do
21:10 budgeting you do your strategy your okrs
21:13 your everything and if you are in the
21:16 top nine percent of those who submitted
21:18 proposals you get money if you don't
21:20 you're jobless that's how it works in
21:22 science and that's what I was doing like
21:25 oh yes it's much more complicated
21:27 compared to like situation and Industry
21:31 in this regard and I got like uh three
21:34 successful grounds in a row which is
21:37 quite good uh to get three successes you
21:39 obviously need to have three or more
21:42 failures as well so not all of my
21:44 proposals were successful but they teach
21:46 the tone how you find collaborators how
21:49 you align with them how you agree how
21:51 you write a plan how you make a strategy
21:53 and so on and then you lead those
21:55 projects so you hire students PhD
21:57 students you Mentor them and you go
22:01 through problems because it's highly
22:03 risky projects in science nobody done it
22:06 you don't know if you can do it or not
22:08 sometimes it leads to invention
22:09 disclosures and great papers sometimes
22:12 oops it's not gonna work it's also
22:14 normal it's very high risky projects and
22:18 all that you can transfer so a lot of
22:20 those skills are actually transferable
22:23 in terms of ownership leadership
22:25 mentorship strategy Road mapping and all
22:28 that stuff
22:29 uh there are some things that you don't
22:32 do like for instance you don't program
22:34 in Scala but you program in fortune or
22:37 Matlab so it's not exactly that but not
22:40 that much different
22:41 so it's technical skills that you need
22:44 to fill the gaps but for technical
22:46 skills I'd say
22:48 six months 12 months you you work
22:52 yourself you learn you get it it's much
22:54 harder to learn soft skills in my
22:57 opinion and to up level your
23:00 communication and collaboration it's a
23:02 way harder than learning python for
23:05 example in my opinion and when you move
23:08 to industry it's important to put the
23:12 right angle on all your previous
23:13 experience and sell it in the right way
23:16 so in the beginning I was making
23:18 mistakes to talking about lasers too
23:20 much so uh at the end I stopped talking
23:23 about lasers at all I was talking what I
23:26 was doing in terms of collaboration
23:28 alignment delivery and so on and you
23:32 could see straight away how it aligns
23:34 well with the stuff role what also helps
23:37 if you look at the tech lead role staff
23:40 role in organization in terms of their
23:43 descriptions and expectations and then
23:44 you see how your previous experience
23:47 alliance with what is inside dock the
23:50 docs are quite possible to find
23:53 so
23:54 I'm not the only although it's not like
23:57 typical to have a career change I'm not
23:59 the only one like that I know a bunch of
24:01 people who were in Academia and or
24:04 Hospital like my mentor in hospital who
24:06 was leading me during my internship he
24:11 moved to Qualcomm Street as a staff
24:13 engineer now he is a principal so and oh
24:16 no he's a director now and then my
24:20 manager my own manager at Linton she
24:22 also started uh she moved from Academia
24:24 to LinkedIn straight to the staff
24:26 position
24:27 so it happens it's just not that common
24:30 because not many people change the area
24:32 and if you're really great scientist you
24:35 actually can start as a distinguished
24:37 but your you has to be fairly you know
24:39 if you're this level of expertise like
24:42 highly recognized scientists and
24:45 Academia you can move to the highest
24:46 level that also happens
24:51 yeah it happens and the other option is
24:56 some people they do PhD for instance and
24:59 they do startup and then if the startup
25:01 is acquired by a bigger big company uh
25:05 they can start at the high level for
25:07 example I know an example when Lyft
25:09 acquired a startup and the startup
25:11 studies will be director so he joined
25:13 industry the director level
25:15 so yeah it's not that you have to start
25:19 with middle Junior Every time we've
25:22 already had some career and you had to
25:24 experience it just to which role you can
25:28 fit most of your transferable skills
25:30 yeah that's that's interesting so the
25:32 main takeaway for me is like you that
25:34 it's a myth that you have to start from
25:37 a junior and you need to sell it to sell
25:41 yourself in the right way and I have two
25:43 follow-up questions here so maybe first
25:48 okay yes you need to sell yourself but
25:50 how do you convince them to actually
25:53 um
25:54 I don't trust you
25:56 how do you convince them that these
25:58 skills that you have are transferable
26:00 from Academia to the industry because at
26:03 the beginning you also said that it's
26:05 very different environments right so how
26:08 do you convince your employer that the
26:10 skills you got in that environment
26:12 are transferable to this new environment
26:15 because they are pretty different
26:18 yeah true however it also depends on the
26:22 angle so in the beginning I wasn't
26:24 successful quiet with that so in fact
26:27 first interviews I was failing but then
26:30 after some practice I learned uh which
26:33 angle to choose how to present my
26:35 projects uh one of the ways is to focus
26:38 on your research projects that you've
26:40 done in partnership with industry and I
26:43 had some of those
26:45 if this was partnership with industry
26:47 and you can say that okay we did we
26:50 deliver it Optical system for alcohol
26:51 who produces lenses to identify defects
26:55 on those lenses in a non-contact method
26:57 and so on so that's pretty much
26:59 industrial things it's very applied so
27:02 focus more on applied projects for
27:04 example and if you had any
27:07 collaborations with big companies it
27:09 also helps things like that obviously
27:13 they had to take risk as well but you
27:16 have to be just better than all other
27:18 candidates so for example if your
27:22 experience was different
27:24 it's probably not that preferable than
27:27 compared if you just move to other big
27:30 tech company at the same role however
27:32 you're always assessed compared to other
27:34 candidates and if you parcel all
27:36 interviews better than other candidates
27:39 it's okay the they may consider you even
27:42 if you change as a role so you have to
27:45 prepare better for interviews and be
27:47 better than others
27:49 yeah so we want to spend quite some time
27:53 talking about injuries but before that
27:56 I'm really curious how did you
27:58 understand for yourself that the Staff
28:00 Roll is really for you like because you
28:03 didn't have this prior experience in
28:05 Industry
28:07 um so somebody probably told you that
28:09 you don't have to start from a junior
28:10 position right so then you learned about
28:12 that this you learned about this stuff
28:14 role you learn it exists and you learn
28:17 that it's something that might fit your
28:19 background your experience experience
28:21 and you started preparing for this so
28:24 how did this happen no it wasn't like
28:26 that I was just applying for any
28:28 positions I did not contact them they
28:30 contacted me first
28:32 uh-huh so the same was this matter I did
28:35 not contact them they wrote me first in
28:37 fact when I was working in in hospital I
28:41 did not consider even big tech companies
28:43 I knew it's very hard to get to and you
28:46 need to prepare for interviews and you
28:49 need to solve those lead Court problems
28:51 so I wasn't applying but they were
28:53 reaching out to me the first was Mata
28:56 who wrote that your your your resume is
28:59 fantastic for our role I got a bit
29:01 surprised but I decided why not to try
29:03 the interviews at the end of the day I
29:05 have nothing to lose
29:07 and that's when I talked to the
29:08 recruiter he decided that it's like a
29:11 senior staff role after we discussed my
29:13 experience I was like okay and I went to
29:15 interviews and I filed code
29:17 but the rest was brilliant like I got
29:19 overwhelming great feedback on system
29:22 design machine learning design cultural
29:24 kit everything just coding obviously
29:26 because I didn't prepare and then I
29:29 realized okay it's not that hard to to
29:31 actually pass interviews to the big tech
29:33 companies all I need is just to start
29:36 lead coding and that's it like yeah
29:40 yeah valzene was also interviewing with
29:45 startups and they were considering me
29:47 for the lead role and in fact I had some
29:49 offer for the leader in one of the
29:51 startups leading the direction so they
29:54 they kind of Justified me this way after
29:57 we discussed my experience and that a
30:00 bit put my level up from what I
30:01 initially thought because this was
30:03 validation from outside and so as I said
30:08 I felt coding can matter but they did
30:11 not send me away because I was quite
30:13 good in designs so they decided to give
30:15 me a second chance and wait so they
30:18 agreed to give me a chance to prepare
30:20 for boarding interviews and gave me five
30:22 five six weeks so I started learning
30:25 lead Code full time and at this time
30:27 when I was almost ready LinkedIn came in
30:31 and just wrote hey we have the staff
30:33 position would you mind to reply and I
30:36 decided why not to go to interviews I
30:38 have nothing to lose and I passed so uh
30:42 because I the lead code was ready so uh
30:46 it was them who decided to contact me
30:48 and why they decided to contact me
30:50 because somebody referred me and why
30:52 somebody referred me because I helped
30:54 that somebody previous before that so
30:57 Health people Karma comes back and when
31:02 they offered me stuff row uh it was not
31:04 my actually I would I wouldn't even
31:07 apply for that maybe but they approached
31:10 me first but then I found that indeed
31:12 I'm quite a good fit for this particular
31:14 type of stuff with a lot of cross-team
31:17 cross-functional collaboration for this
31:19 particular type I am a good fit yeah
31:21 yeah and I think two years ago we
31:24 discussed the
31:25 this at length like how exactly you can
31:28 help like I think we talked about like
31:31 uh different myths on how you can
31:34 um
31:36 we talked about like forming teams right
31:39 so how you approach career changes and
31:43 helping others was one of the things
31:45 there so and then I guess you were doing
31:47 this for quite some time and then Karma
31:49 uh thanked you right
31:52 and what I liked what you said right now
31:54 multiple times that you have nothing to
31:56 lose like every time an opportunity
31:58 comes you say okay whatever like
32:01 what can possibly go wrong there right
32:03 like they decline me and
32:05 that's that's not the end of the world
32:07 right
32:08 yeah if you if they deny you you're
32:10 exactly the stage where you are now so
32:13 you're not losing I don't know some
32:15 people are afraid of failures but in
32:16 fact those are not failures failures is
32:19 when you when you lose a lot like you
32:21 cannot do federal in Mountain young that
32:24 is a bit of a problem
32:29 rejections suck right like it's kind of
32:32 bad for your self-esteem for self-worth
32:36 like okay like they say I'm not worth
32:39 this stuff engineered position then I'm
32:42 not worthy at all no
32:44 no not for me I just don't feel like I I
32:47 look at it like it's adventure let's try
32:49 it and if I felt okay I learned this
32:51 this I failed a lot before I passed
32:54 basically in the beginning I was failing
32:56 every interview every I felt lived I
33:00 failed me I tell the end because I did
33:01 not pass that code ink again
33:04 and I felt lots of startups and so on
33:08 but I don't feel that it's um it doesn't
33:11 affect my self-esteem because I consider
33:13 it as learning so I need to learn
33:15 interview process interview process has
33:18 nothing to do with my abilities
33:20 uh expertise and so on
33:25 so maybe because I don't consider
33:28 evaluation an interview really as
33:31 evaluation
33:32 of you it's more like a evaluation of
33:35 your interview skills in a way how did
33:38 you arrive at this how did you arrive at
33:41 this conclusion that uh I mean I totally
33:43 agree with you uh but it probably took
33:47 some time for you to realize that it's
33:49 not about you you just need to know the
33:52 process
33:53 yeah
33:54 well try and unfailing that's how I
33:56 arrived
33:59 yeah I was trying in the beginning I
34:02 learned that okay you need to change
34:05 this you need to work on this and next
34:07 time it goes better and next time it
34:09 goes better I did a lot of mock
34:11 interviews I remember you were helping
34:13 me thank you with Mark interview as well
34:15 so I and I asked many people so and I
34:18 learned a lot about that as well and
34:20 when I started to realize
34:24 which problems they need to solve how to
34:26 present myself and so on and it started
34:29 to be bad at this and I clearly
34:32 understood it's more about preparing for
34:34 interests and learning how to
34:36 explain your thoughts well
34:39 then I think it's also one of the things
34:41 we talked about last time like
34:43 um you know failure is not necessarily
34:45 bad right it's an opportunity to learn
34:48 yeah and so you said that during the
34:53 interview with Mehta you did quite well
34:56 at system design ml design other things
34:59 you didn't do well in coding in lead
35:02 code kind of questions
35:04 so how did you actually
35:07 without working in the industry
35:09 how did you actually manage to prepare
35:11 yourself
35:12 and pass this interviews
35:15 yeah so uh for the big tech companies
35:18 let's separate their tops from Big tech
35:20 companies they have different flows and
35:24 for the startups it's hard actually to
35:27 prepare because they can ask you
35:29 whatever they want and in any manner for
35:33 the big tech companies the process is
35:35 more or less standardized and go through
35:38 certain steps and you can familiarize
35:41 yourself and and start preparing
35:44 so one of the important aspects of big
35:48 tech companies they ask you code in
35:50 interviews uh with type of questions
35:53 that you can find on lead code
35:55 and uh so far I did not see many people
35:59 who are able to solve them without
36:00 preparation there are guys who can come
36:03 and solve it but they were participating
36:05 in competitive programming and they sold
36:07 about thousands of them in school so
36:09 that doesn't count if you never solve
36:12 them and you never solve like thousands
36:14 of that in school chances are big
36:16 chances are you will not pass that
36:18 interview so that interview is more
36:20 about preparation than about your coding
36:22 skills which is a bit annoying for most
36:24 of the programmers in the world but this
36:27 is a scalable solution and that's how
36:29 you can assess different candidates
36:31 fairly
36:33 so that was the biggest challenge for me
36:35 although I know that for some people
36:37 machine donate design is the biggest
36:39 challenge and some people are not very
36:42 good in behavioral interviews so
36:45 although it's so everybody is different
36:47 so for me the biggest challenge as I
36:50 realized was this lead Court type of
36:53 interviews
36:54 I got lit got premium that was a good
36:58 idea in lit got premium you see not only
37:01 popular questions but you also can see
37:04 Solutions and they also provide you
37:07 cards with Siri so I will start in
37:11 studying recursion how to form it and
37:14 then we'll go through some common tasks
37:17 with Solutions and after you've done 10
37:19 of those you can solve 11s hopefully
37:22 yourself
37:23 and for every topic it was like that all
37:26 the topics were new for me I didn't know
37:27 about different recursion when I started
37:29 because I don't have computer science
37:31 degree I did not do that algorithms in
37:35 University
37:36 so that was maybe that's why it was the
37:39 biggest challenge for me so in total I'd
37:41 say two months is enough uh as for me I
37:44 was doing it at that time the work in
37:48 hospital stopped because we that's
37:50 exactly when what happens when you don't
37:52 raise funded for the next proposals that
37:55 I described so sometimes you fail and
37:57 then you're jobless so is that exactly
37:59 what happened in the hospital we did not
38:01 raise money for the next stage
38:04 and everybody who was not a doctor who
38:07 was a contractor got jobless
38:09 it means that I had plenty of time for
38:12 coding so I was coding nine to five
38:14 every day and in five five six weeks I
38:18 got like 300 300 problems in Bitcoin so
38:23 if you solve about 300 350 problems
38:25 mostly focusing on mediums not easy and
38:29 do all the theory I'd say to some big
38:32 tech companies it will be enough maybe
38:34 not for Google but for for many it will
38:36 be enough
38:37 so that's how I prepared lit coat
38:40 uh
38:42 admirable perseverance like like six
38:46 weeks in a row yes nine to five or nine
38:50 to six uh uh 350 problems on lead code
38:55 that's uh really an accomplishment
38:58 how did you how did you not give up I
39:03 like that at the end so in the beginning
39:04 I hated it but after some time it's
39:07 actually cool you know I like it I'm I
39:09 like physics math and those type of
39:11 algorithms those challenges I found it
39:14 Pleasant after some time so I am a geek
39:19 yeah I can like such people I guess like
39:22 when you solve a problem yourself
39:23 without looking at hints you kind of get
39:26 a
39:31 different yeah but it's like a bit like
39:34 gaming right when you when some people
39:36 like gaming so when they're successful
39:38 they get this hormones
39:40 same for me when I solve liquid myself
39:42 yeah
39:44 okay how about uh like we sleep lead
39:47 chord is just grinding right so you have
39:49 to do this a lot right so you have to
39:51 solve a lot of problems especially if
39:53 you don't have a computer science
39:54 background like in your case
39:56 um how about other
39:58 rounds like system design ml design
40:01 Behavioral
40:02 I think for Behavioral probably like you
40:05 said you have these soft skills that you
40:08 had from Academia and then probably it's
40:10 just about thinking about situations you
40:12 had in Academia and then
40:14 you know describing these situations uh
40:18 how about these two others like system
40:20 design ml design
40:21 which you don't do in Academia I guess
40:26 so uh surprisingly easy for me was a
40:29 male design and I realized that an
40:31 Academia was designed in Optical systems
40:33 and lasers and they have much in common
40:36 with machine learning designs you also
40:38 start to scratch with the first
40:40 principles you understand what you want
40:42 to
40:43 accomplish which data you need to
40:45 collect how much data how you want to
40:47 annotate it and so on and you can see
40:49 the different options and their
40:51 trade-offs and so basically ml design in
40:57 the way of thinking
40:59 in the way of thinking it's quite
41:02 similar to designs and physics in a way
41:05 yeah it's completely different fields
41:07 and you need to know different
41:08 techniques and stuff but your way of
41:10 thinking of decomposition is a problem
41:13 and planning and about data and your
41:16 intuitions physics helps a lot here to
41:19 be honest that was my Discovery but to
41:22 do that properly I've done several mock
41:25 interviews with people I know on ML
41:28 design mock interviews helped me the
41:30 most
41:31 I also found some blog posts about ml
41:35 design and a couple of YouTube videos
41:38 and there is also groking ml design
41:40 course but I did not like that one to be
41:43 honest
41:44 and uh the the best was a blog post by
41:48 Patrick calina who wrote basically how
41:50 to answer the email design on the staff
41:52 level and he's a staff in Pinterest so
41:56 and I followed his guide more or less
41:59 his plan but also what was useful is for
42:04 each particular company I would go on
42:06 their blog post and I will read about
42:08 their ml designs for example I go to
42:11 lift I then open blog post of Lyft and I
42:14 read about the ml designs and then on
42:16 interviews when they asked me I say yeah
42:18 I've read in your blog post you do it
42:20 the following way that's already a plus
42:22 because you prepared and you know what
42:24 stag they're using and you know what
42:26 kind of designs they work on so if you
42:30 go to YouTube you can just open the
42:32 papers they publish recommendation
42:35 systems and RK film and in the blog post
42:38 whatever is published and familiarize
42:41 yourself
42:41 with how they design things I think it
42:44 makes sense and when you uh studied for
42:47 a number of companies like YouTube
42:49 Google TripAdvisor and so on you start
42:53 to see the butters as well
42:55 and also what they write often like
43:00 Airbnb also wrote about their
43:03 ml designs attempts they write what
43:05 worked what did not work
43:07 in industry in real life unlike all
43:10 those academic narrow papers not always
43:13 what you see in academic papers is
43:16 really applicable to industry or maybe
43:19 they just move a Magic by 0.001 percent
43:22 with a lot of effort and that's not what
43:24 you're gonna do so having those blog
43:28 posts from companies uh helped to
43:31 identify Butters and answer questions a
43:34 lot
43:35 how did you approach
43:39 systematizing all this information
43:41 because to me like it sounds like a lot
43:43 a huge lot of different sources
43:48 and it's just like how how do you even
43:50 manage to process and
43:53 you know learn from this in a way that
43:56 you could talk about this at an
43:58 interview like did you take notes did
44:00 you uh I don't know use some some
44:05 special approach or how did you do this
44:07 yeah I'm an old school so I keep things
44:10 like that all the time I write
44:14 oh that's about dirt that's when I was
44:16 studying about birth old school listen
44:19 to this without videos it's old school
44:21 you you go through courses and you write
44:23 the notes and then you summarize
44:26 email design on system design course and
44:30 I have three of those in lead code
44:31 because on bitcoin I realized that it
44:34 works better when you ride by hand so
44:36 whatever I have a challenging task is
44:38 that I can't solve
44:40 and understand easily and after I
44:43 understood it I still want to engrave It
44:45 In My Memory I just take a pen and write
44:47 it down like literally write it down
44:49 because that's that's how I remember
44:51 things it helps me so that's how I was
44:54 it was a lot of systematic knowledge but
44:56 for email design it just took maybe a
44:58 week and for system design it took me
45:01 like five days to prepare and for a lead
45:03 quote it was like almost two months so
45:06 but for for some other people can be
45:08 different
45:09 so for system design I just
45:12 followed some advice on internet and I
45:15 bought grocking system design course uh
45:18 it was quite cheap like I think 50 50.
45:21 dollars or something so I bought it and
45:25 I started it and that was enough to pass
45:27 the interview
45:29 although if you want adapts
45:31 understanding people advise reading data
45:34 intensive applications book which I also
45:38 read parts of it but for interview
45:41 actually having that course
45:43 and 20 mooc interviews
45:46 is more interviews are important very
45:48 important
45:50 um that that will be enough to to pass
45:52 the interview but it doesn't make you a
45:54 great system designer of course you need
45:56 to have some Hands-On practice after
45:59 you pass the interview and start working
46:01 as the company I guess right
46:03 yes so you understand you understand the
46:07 basics so people who um do an ml design
46:10 need to understand system design because
46:12 you are designing ml systems at scale
46:15 but if you're hired for ML part male
46:19 part I'd say it's more important than
46:21 your experience with lower balancers and
46:24 things like that because there is always
46:26 infrastructure team in big companies who
46:29 take care of that but you need to
46:31 understand on High level how it works
46:33 more or less but if you don't know all
46:35 the load balancing techniques after some
46:38 time maybe it's not crucial you know it
46:41 depends on your own
46:43 oh I have one week to prepare for system
46:46 design is pretty impressive given that I
46:49 don't know
46:50 I know I don't know much about your
46:53 prior background because before that but
46:56 I guess like terms like load balancer
47:00 didn't mean much to you before you know
47:02 you started reading these things so like
47:04 and processing all that one in one week
47:09 is impressive so you probably have very
47:11 good memory
47:12 yeah I have a good memory plus I had a
47:15 the most what works to me is deadlines I
47:17 just put that into reviews with Facebook
47:19 because why not to try and then for ML
47:22 part I already uh tried and failed and
47:25 lift and I passed in shutter stock and I
47:27 had some offers so ml part was pretty
47:29 much trained and system design was
47:32 specifically
47:34 um
47:35 for Facebook because in other companies
47:37 they didn't ask it they did not ask
47:39 system design at Newton for example and
47:42 on Facebook they ask system design and I
47:45 did not have a chance to prepare for
47:47 that before but I already put an
47:49 interview so I had a deadline so I just
47:51 did all that course in five days and put
47:55 few more interviews with people
47:57 who worked in Facebook and so the great
48:01 help was that I could practice more
48:04 interview I was a person who who worked
48:07 in Facebook and he knew what is expected
48:10 on assistive design but I passed note
48:13 because of that I passed because the
48:15 role was more about an intersection of
48:18 machine learning and Optics and we did
48:20 not dive that much into system design
48:22 but we were discussing things like 3D
48:24 reconstruction and epipolar access and
48:27 Optics and that's my field so I I a bit
48:31 got lucky as well with the topic but
48:33 that's how they selected my resume out
48:35 out of all possible recipes I think they
48:38 needed somebody with expertise and
48:40 Optics and that helped
48:42 and from what I heard from you having a
48:45 network is really helpful
48:48 if you know somebody or can get to know
48:51 somebody from meta or from the company
48:53 where you have an interview and just ask
48:55 them hey can you have a mock interview
48:58 with me please
48:59 and then I just okay how about yes
49:02 and that's how you prepare right because
49:05 I I understand that just taking a course
49:07 is not enough right no no not enough you
49:11 it's hard to put it all in your head
49:13 properly and during mock interviews you
49:15 learn more
49:16 um there are other kids like yes it's
49:18 nice if you have mentors and people who
49:20 are willing to help you but uh ideally I
49:23 try to have it like Mutual that I give
49:25 value to person and he gives value to me
49:28 so so uh what can you do if other people
49:31 are much more experienced than you you
49:33 cannot provide them more contributors
49:35 but there were also more contributors
49:37 when we did it mutually so I interviewed
49:39 the guy and he interviews me and we must
49:41 prepare for the same level of position
49:43 because there were a couple of
49:44 interviews like that and yes uh lucky
49:49 enough I had mentors who were willing
49:51 just to help me but I will just for
49:53 instance send them a painting as a thank
49:55 you so I like to return give something
49:59 in return but not always you can give
50:01 the same level because they're more
50:02 advanced well then you can gift a
50:06 painting for example
50:08 well sometimes people are just
50:10 fine with helping without expecting
50:13 anything in return because who knows
50:16 maybe in 10 years he will be their
50:18 manager or something like you know this
50:20 Karma I think that you mentioned
50:22 you help somebody and then after some
50:24 time they refer you
50:25 and you get it
50:28 yeah I think it's those a good strategy
50:30 like I always try to help other people
50:33 so people whom I Mentor I am more
50:37 advanced than when there are people who
50:38 Mentor me but across the global there's
50:41 getting help and providing help I I like
50:44 to keep it in Balance even more on
50:46 health Insight also it makes you happier
50:49 I think if you help somebody and you see
50:51 the progress it does yeah
50:53 so you see that there are some questions
50:56 um so a question from Harry uh is a
50:59 stuffy engineer how much of your time do
51:01 you deal with data Engineers data
51:03 scientists with building etls building
51:06 pipelines and doing all this and a lot
51:09 of stuff
51:10 yes so again it depends on the projects
51:13 and some projects you have a lot of
51:15 collaboration with data scientists so
51:18 because you require some initial
51:20 analysis I think and some projects
51:24 you collaborate most products in some
51:26 projects you have to collaborate quite a
51:29 lot with legal so it's kind of Project
51:31 based so but as I said like all those
51:35 collaborations like it's around half
51:36 half of the time
51:38 and then the other part of the time is
51:44 designs and reviewing and preparing the
51:47 docs and things like that
51:50 so ETL pipelines I do Implement some
51:53 because I like to stay Hands-On but uh
51:56 most of the time they implement it
51:59 for you by people who you meant to so
52:02 you just
52:04 decide what has to be done and they
52:06 implement it and you review the code
52:09 um and he said that you do quite a lot
52:12 of code reviewing right
52:14 a lot yeah write a lot of code review
52:16 again
52:18 how do like for me doing code review is
52:21 difficult because if I'm working uh
52:25 with multiple projects at the same time
52:27 every time I review a piece of code I
52:30 need to get back into the context of
52:31 that specific project and understand why
52:34 this code is written in exactly this way
52:35 and this is very difficult like
52:38 especially if it's like three four
52:39 projects at the same time how do you do
52:42 this
52:43 yeah I could have like five projects at
52:46 the same time but I quite well remember
52:48 each Corner because you jump between
52:50 meetings so literally like now you're
52:53 discussing this project the next project
52:54 25 minutes 25 minutes you just jump
52:57 between meetings and you're already like
52:59 switching context I think it just trains
53:02 you to be always
53:04 uh in context or maybe just might think
53:07 that I I am quite easy to switch and I
53:10 remember what's going on in like five
53:12 different projects did you do anything
53:15 special to to get this skill or it was
53:19 just always like that for you it was
53:22 always like that for me I yeah
53:25 from the twitching was easy for me yeah
53:28 always
53:29 okay yeah because I was going to ask you
53:32 for advice how to approach that but I
53:36 guess this is just a gift maybe I don't
53:39 know uh it just yeah it's easy for me to
53:42 speak
53:43 I committing to meeting completely
53:44 change of content
53:46 different projects that we discuss okay
53:48 and yeah
53:51 hard to advice what to do about it
53:56 um well maybe I guess what worked for me
53:59 at the end I think is somehow
54:03 um arrange things in a way that don't
54:05 require contact switch like sequentially
54:08 and then maybe have this box
54:11 but yeah it's it's not easy at least for
54:13 me
54:14 so another question that I still I think
54:17 we have in the list and I didn't ask you
54:20 is
54:21 somebody let's say wants to follow your
54:24 path and go from Academia
54:27 to Industry and also get on a staff
54:31 level
54:32 what advice would you give to them
54:35 yeah that's a good question first of all
54:39 don't be shy to go to the tech League
54:42 draw or lead Joel if you were leading in
54:44 Academia you have most of the
54:46 challenging transferable soft skills
54:48 it's much harder to learn than learn in
54:50 programming or you know git and other
54:54 tools
54:56 prepare some pet projects that are in
54:59 line but also look at your own career as
55:02 a whole and the parts where you were
55:05 leading things initializing things
55:07 mentoring teaching up leveling Team all
55:10 that is quite transferable and important
55:13 uh if you able to understand the
55:16 requirements of the future role of a
55:18 lead or Tech lead get them and see how
55:21 this aligns with your previous
55:23 experience
55:24 prepare well for cultural interview
55:26 because a behavioral interview it's
55:28 exactly when you show yourself at the
55:31 right level most to it you do that for
55:33 during all interviews but the cultural
55:36 behavioral interview it's the main show
55:38 of of your
55:40 leadership skills your ownership and
55:43 prepare for that well you may also want
55:46 to practice that with somebody who
55:48 already is an industry on a high level
55:50 role if you happen to have judgmental
55:52 like a director I didn't so I didn't
55:54 prepare but if I could I would use that
55:57 chance and get the feedback some people
55:59 get even coaching and Consulting on that
56:02 obviously prepare for the others
56:04 interviews also well because even if
56:07 you're a great leader and so on if you
56:08 fail complete quoting because we know
56:10 you will not get a job so you you have
56:14 to be ready for the other things too and
56:17 uh give yourself time it's okay if
56:21 you're gonna fail for some time it took
56:22 me a year between when I started
56:25 interviewing and I could not pass down
56:27 to the point when I had all interviews
56:30 all offered so I had like five
56:31 interviews in process and like five
56:33 offers a hundred percent so from zero
56:36 percent to 100 it took me one year and a
56:38 lot of failures be ready for that
56:42 if you don't fail and you don't try you
56:45 will not get it like like kids who learn
56:47 something they always fail it from the
56:49 first time using
56:52 and learn to live with failure right
56:55 it's not about you personally
56:58 not about you I will never do consider
57:00 it as a failure for me failure is like
57:02 you know uh something where you really
57:04 lose in like mountaineering is dangerous
57:08 but interviews if you if you fail you're
57:11 exactly where you were so it's not
57:13 really a failure it's more like a try
57:16 with no risk
57:19 yeah we have nothing to lose yes you
57:21 have nothing to lose really so yeah
57:24 you're saying this like third fourth
57:26 time yes but this is the case right
57:29 because it is a kiss yes so when people
57:31 don't want to try because they're afraid
57:34 I completely don't understand yes so
57:37 it's it is the case
57:40 and a question from Charlie
57:43 is what is the most exciting thing about
57:46 working as an AI engineer or AI staff
57:48 engineer
57:50 oh yes
57:51 um this is very interesting field uh
57:54 look what happens now with all the
57:56 strategypt and diffusion models and so
57:58 on so you're at the age of Technology
58:00 you're actually like
58:03 one of the first people who are making
58:05 the future and moving into the future so
58:07 that's very exciting you can actually
58:09 try lots of different Technologies and
58:12 uh if you have a freedom of of what you
58:15 want to try because you can also lead
58:17 somewhere in D projects for example
58:19 and this I find very exciting that you
58:22 have to learn in this fast change in
58:25 field when the future is really coming
58:27 every few months you have some new
58:30 Revolution some changes that's very
58:33 interesting and that's very cool and
58:36 mastering this and understanding how it
58:38 all works it's very interesting so so
58:42 the other part is if you like I really
58:46 like uh I I was craving for that in
58:49 science is to see quite a big and fast
58:54 turnover between your work and some
58:57 impact and metrics of Revenue and so on
59:01 in the company you work so when you
59:03 actually push things in the production
59:05 and you see how the influence
59:09 um and you see the impact it's very
59:11 pleasant not always it's a case in
59:13 science sometimes to develop lots of
59:15 things to write papers but you don't
59:16 feel
59:17 it's neat and you don't feel the impact
59:21 it takes time and science to get an
59:23 impact
59:25 yeah thanks I know we're running out of
59:28 time but this one will be the last one
59:30 and really quick are there any books or
59:33 other learning resources that you can
59:34 recommend to the listeners
59:36 yeah there are lots of books depending
59:39 on what you want but I think that I'll
59:42 take like one or two
59:44 I like communication for communication I
59:48 think it's important to learn how to
59:50 communicate it's crucial conversations
59:51 and never split the difference it says
59:54 that will be the the best too uh if you
59:58 want to understand about staff role as a
1:00:01 staff engineering pass is the best book
1:00:03 on that one I'd say
1:00:06 um
1:00:08 then
1:00:10 I like books in general about leadership
1:00:14 and ownership and stuff there is a book
1:00:16 extreme ownership
1:00:19 and
1:00:21 for career it's highly Advanced to read
1:00:25 the book Rise by by tellisale
1:00:33 thank you so
1:00:36 always pleasure having you here we
1:00:38 should uh maybe in two years again have
1:00:41 a chat and see what changed uh so yeah
1:00:45 thanks for joining us today thanks for
1:00:47 sharing your knowledge your experience
1:00:49 uh getting this uh stuff AI engineering
1:00:52 role uh training with us what you do and
1:00:56 yeah thanks everyone for joining us
1:00:59 today too and everyone have a great
1:01:01 weekend
