0:51 during the interview
0:54 so now I will stop sharing my screen
0:58 and I will find the questions that
1:01 Johanna prepared for you
1:04 and
1:07 yeah I don't know if you want to open
1:10 this document too
1:12 it's up to you I I have it here but I
1:16 got a separate one with my answers
1:18 okay so you have both of them cool so
1:23 then I guess we start right yeah
1:27 this week we'll talk about data access
1:29 management and we have special guests
1:31 today part Bart is the CEO and
1:34 co-founder at ratio rato rato right yeah
1:38 right away
1:41 Bart is on a mission to give data
1:43 workers access to the data they need to
1:45 do their job in a faster and safer way
1:47 before co-founding rate top art worked
1:50 as a senior product manager in the data
1:52 privacy area at equilibrium and Barb
1:55 released that for data to be liquid
1:57 trust has to be solid and you will
1:59 probably tell us later what has been for
2:01 data today because I have no idea like
2:03 my imagination is not that good to
2:06 understand this metaphor so welcome to
2:08 our show
2:09 hey Alexa thanks for having me super
2:11 excited to be here don't be on the show
2:13 today
2:14 so as always the questions you will hear
2:17 today are prepared by Johanna Byer
2:20 thanks a lot Johanna for your help
2:22 and um yeah so before we go into our
2:25 main topic of data access management
2:27 let's start with your background can you
2:30 tell us about your career Journeys for
2:32 hey yeah Alexis so there was a really a
2:35 great summary uh before starting right
2:37 so I was indeed a product manager a
2:40 privacy at calibra uh that's where we
2:43 also saw the challenge of scalable data
2:45 access management now Libra was my first
2:48 step in uh the world of data and uh
2:52 software before that I was actually a
2:57 consultant at Deloitte you know I was
2:59 doing Financial Risk Management
3:01 and uh but there I saw that you know the
3:04 future is data everything evolves around
3:07 data and that's why I made to move to to
3:10 calibra but I learned that you know for
3:13 data to be really successful and for
3:15 organizations to be really successful
3:17 they need to have that trust right and
3:20 that's why I started uh writing together
3:23 with the deed of my co-founder mm-hmm
3:26 so what did you do as a consultant at
3:28 Deloitte
3:30 uh we helped Banks uh with you know
3:35 accounting with the valuation of
3:38 financial products there was a lot of
3:41 mathematics a lot of physics so models
3:44 that we borrowed from physics uh but
3:47 then gradually I was also stuck was
3:49 getting more and more involved in a data
3:52 governance programs because this was
3:53 right after the financial crisis that
3:56 was where uh for banks it was impossible
3:59 to know know how much loans were
4:03 defaulted what their exposure was to
4:05 other Banks and then the European
4:07 supervisor European regulator actually
4:09 boast data governance regulation on
4:11 banks to improve their quality lineage
4:14 and so forth and in that way I kind of
4:17 evolved into the data governance space
4:21 so basically there was a financial
4:23 crisis and then
4:26 Banks had some data but it was a mess
4:29 huge mess and what you did as a part of
4:33 your job as a consultant at Deloitte was
4:36 to help them
4:38 make it less messy right yeah indeed I I
4:42 I mean doc talking about a trauma right
4:45 this is before you add all the hip data
4:47 governance solutions that are out there
4:49 now right like I mean if you have to do
4:51 data governance now
4:52 it's much more pleasant than when I had
4:55 to do it I had to draw a lineage in like
4:58 the office Tool uh I had to uh keep data
5:03 dictionaries in Excel so this was before
5:06 all the tooling was there and I can tell
5:08 you uh it was not great by the time my
5:12 lineage was ready it was already
5:14 outdated so by the time my dictionary
5:16 was ready it was already outdated and I
5:18 had to go back
5:19 so what is data governance actually
5:24 recovery is is a
5:28 Chinese mentioned the word data
5:31 conference you know you see people
5:32 frantically looking for the nearest exit
5:34 to escape the conversation it's a it's a
5:39 heavy load of words you know but I mean
5:42 if I would have to summarize their
5:43 governance it's just you know all the
5:46 activities that you do to create trust
5:49 in the data that you're using right so
5:51 your your data worker so data analysts
5:54 scientists you know they can trust that
5:56 they're using the right data they can
5:58 trust that the data has sufficient data
6:01 quality uh but also just your customers
6:04 can trust that their data is being used
6:07 in in a safe way you know if you you
6:10 know put it in that perspective who
6:13 doesn't want data governance right
6:16 um so despite you know the bad
6:18 connotation that data conference has
6:20 uh if you're really serious about using
6:24 data as a competitive asset you need to
6:26 create a trust and hence you need to do
6:28 some of those activities uh but the cool
6:31 thing is that the perception is Shifting
6:33 you got all these cool startups now
6:35 among others rights or rights that help
6:39 you do data access or data governance in
6:41 a more scalable way
6:43 why does it actually have bad
6:45 connotation like why do people are
6:47 searching for the fire exit when yeah
6:50 yeah
6:53 uh it's because you know how we used to
6:56 do data governance it used to be very
6:58 centralized right uh a bit like in an
7:01 ivory Tower Excel sheets that you Excel
7:04 sheets
7:06 so it's a couple of things it's the
7:08 awareness it was very hard it's fake
7:11 still today very difficult to you know
7:14 make people aware in the organization of
7:16 the importance of good data governance
7:18 right
7:19 um there's also the way that we used to
7:22 do data governance it used to be in an
7:24 ivory Tower your boss is your standards
7:26 that you try to impose on the
7:28 organization and it was always you know
7:30 bolted on bolted on data products
7:33 spotted on how we use data and that
7:36 creates a lot of friction right it makes
7:37 it a data governance team is more
7:39 policing but why why doesn't it happen
7:42 like is it because like somebody from
7:44 like for example in your case when you
7:46 worked at Deloitte
7:48 you commission or whatever some some
7:50 entity governmental entity said okay you
7:53 have a mess Banks go fix it and then
7:55 like probably top Management in a bank
7:57 thought
7:58 more just told others like hey like we
8:02 have a message data go fix it right so
8:04 this was like a top down decision and
8:06 then it was forced on people and it was
8:10 too difficult to implement right that's
8:12 that's why it's uh it has this bad
8:14 connotation yeah indeed
8:17 we're learning right the government is
8:19 going to transition and how it used to
8:22 be uh was indeed it was stopped down and
8:25 forced on the organization people had to
8:27 do it they didn't want to do it and
8:29 what's happening now is it's becoming
8:32 more and more about you know uh
8:34 Grassroots Bottoms Up where data
8:37 governance is being implemented or in
8:40 the data in the data Ops process right
8:43 data Engineers can
8:44 integrate interdevelopment process
8:46 making it so much easier and becomes
8:49 more convenient and also they really see
8:52 the value from it so in in that
8:53 perspective it's really evolving in a
8:56 good way
8:58 so you mentioned a few things so you
9:00 mentioned that like a thing called Data
9:03 lineage that you use the office tools to
9:06 draw then you mentioned a data
9:08 dictionary was an Excel but what these
9:10 things actually are and why did Banks
9:13 care about them like why was it
9:14 important for them to actually have
9:16 these things why why did they care about
9:18 that like how did it help to solve their
9:20 problems
9:23 um
9:24 I don't think they really cared uh back
9:27 then right this is 2009 2010 it was
9:31 basically the BCBS 239 regulation that
9:35 uh kind of imposed uh better process
9:38 better data governance
9:40 um on on banks uh so they had to live to
9:44 combine they had to comply uh and that's
9:48 that's why it was also top down you had
9:50 to do it and nowadays it's people are
9:53 more and more becoming aware that you
9:55 have to do it if you really want to use
9:57 data so that's a bit the Mind shift
9:59 that's happening today
10:02 and this lineage and data Dictionary
10:05 what is this
10:07 so a dictionary is basically just uh um
10:11 or or a catalog right is is a let me say
10:15 by stop by saying what a catalog is
10:17 catalog is just a list of all your data
10:19 sets that you have in your organization
10:22 and now just with their description what
10:24 you can find in a data set and also just
10:27 a definition right because customer
10:29 depending on where you are in a business
10:31 that word has a different interpretation
10:33 right in finance customer is somebody
10:36 that's paying the bills paying their
10:38 their invoices whereas in sales a
10:41 customer is somebody that's sometimes is
10:42 becoming a customer right so different
10:45 definitions you have to be sure what the
10:47 definition is if you look at the report
10:49 and and a Lynch is like a addressability
10:52 view a view of how your data flows
10:54 through your application and data
10:57 sources
10:59 just like okay this data
11:02 starts here then there is this
11:04 transformation applied to this data and
11:06 this transformation and this is how it
11:07 ends in a report for the I don't know
11:10 somebody from the top management you can
11:12 see all the
11:15 all the Journey of the data yeah that's
11:18 correct okay
11:21 and what does it have to do with data
11:25 access management like what is data
11:26 that's management yeah yeah well data
11:29 access management it's it's a weird
11:32 conundrum uh it's security right that
11:35 access management is really like a form
11:37 of access management it's it's security
11:39 but how it has historically grown is
11:41 that it's now a responsibility of the
11:43 data governance teams of the data teams
11:45 right so in this way it's a bit weird
11:47 but to understand data access management
11:50 you got to take a step back right access
11:54 imagine used to be uh or we used to
11:57 manage access at the application or
11:59 database level right you had access or
12:02 you did not but once you had access you
12:04 had access to all the data in there
12:07 right but now it's like the the cloud
12:11 compute cloud storage that's completely
12:13 revolutionized the way that we use data
12:16 and what you see is that you know data
12:18 teams are now like massively building
12:21 analytical workflows or the assignable
12:24 data science workflows on the clouds on
12:27 public Cloud right so
12:30 by doing that they're taking data from
12:32 all these different systems and
12:34 applications and moving it to one
12:36 location your Lake your Warehouse right
12:40 um and by doing that they lose the
12:42 Chinese wall that they naturally have
12:44 between this different Source systems
12:47 now we do our data in one location and
12:50 it being uh publicly assessed and
12:52 accessed over the web of course you need
12:55 to have this same Chinese walls in your
12:58 lakes and the warehouses right because
13:00 you know you've seen all the data
13:01 breaches you open you look at LinkedIn
13:04 or newspaper and there's data breaches
13:06 in there there's all the Privacy
13:08 regulations your customer awareness is
13:11 increasing so you need to have this same
13:13 Chinese walls in your warehouse and in
13:16 your Lake and that means matching access
13:17 at the data set level and that's data
13:20 access management
13:22 okay and you mentioned that
13:25 data access management in this is
13:27 responsibility of the data governance
13:30 team so what is the data governance team
13:33 actually what do they do yeah well it
13:36 kind of depends right so what we see is
13:39 that in in organizations
13:41 that are really data driven right so
13:44 they're driven organizations up to 3 000
13:46 people their data access management is
13:48 still the responsibility of the the data
13:51 team like the data Engineers right and
13:53 then for large organizations you'll see
13:55 that they start building out a data
13:57 governance team and there they will be
13:59 responsible for like data access
14:01 management or in certain cases when
14:04 they're implementing like a data mesh
14:06 then it's a data owners who are
14:08 responsible for data access management
14:11 as for a data governance team that is
14:15 the nature of that team is kind of
14:17 Shifting right it used to be a
14:20 dictionary and definitions the lineage
14:23 the get log and so forth but now it's
14:26 also becoming more and more of a team
14:29 that also you know promotes data usage
14:33 this evangelization and enables teams to
14:37 use data in a more efficient way so it's
14:39 going more from monitoring and policing
14:41 to enabling
14:43 um the business
14:47 so in smaller organizations
14:50 to 3000 people
14:52 very small organizations right so in
14:55 these organizations
14:57 there is a team I guess a central team
14:59 of data engineers
15:01 who move data from one place to another
15:03 and as a part of that they Implement
15:06 some of the things we discussed right so
15:09 it's just data Engineers who do that but
15:11 like how much
15:13 I'm thinking of data Engineers like
15:16 whose core skills are
15:18 I don't know Cloud holy city building
15:21 etls spark python Docker like all this
15:24 stuff like very technical people
15:27 how do they actually know about what
15:29 they need to do like how do they need to
15:31 educate themselves in
15:34 in data governance data access
15:36 management because like it's uh it
15:39 doesn't seem like the core job or maybe
15:41 it should be but not at least
15:43 from what I see what typically data
15:47 Engineers do
15:48 uh that's the the what you're just
15:51 describing is a core problem look if
15:53 you're a data engineer who is interested
15:55 in data governance you know please
15:57 investigate please learn more it's only
15:59 going to improve your career but it's
16:01 not your core competence right you
16:04 haven't studied or you haven't delved
16:06 into Data engineering to the data
16:08 governance and then that's a bit the the
16:10 challenge that we're seeing as
16:12 specifically for data access management
16:13 as we're talking to a lot of
16:15 organizations you know the data
16:17 Engineers they have to do it because
16:18 that's how it was right and then they
16:21 get access requests you have to access
16:22 or they have to manage access and they
16:25 have to do it because they know the
16:26 technology that's the only reason
16:27 they're not doing it because they know
16:29 the business context or they know the
16:31 policies no it's because they know the
16:33 technology and they use it so they end
16:35 up being the the person has to process
16:38 the the access requests and that's not
16:40 how it should be right you know it's not
16:42 their core competence it's not what
16:43 they've been hired for they should focus
16:46 on other things like managing
16:47 infrastructure and that's why you see
16:49 that somewhat larger organizations
16:51 indeed they've realized that hey this
16:54 shouldn't be with the data team let's
16:55 give it to the data owners or the data
16:57 governance team
16:59 say in larger or maybe more mature
17:01 organizations
17:03 there is the central data team with data
17:05 Engineers but in addition to that there
17:07 is this data governance team
17:09 yeah yeah or like or a data mesh team
17:12 where in the responsibility is is with
17:16 the data owners yeah
17:17 and what kind of skills these people in
17:21 the data governance team should have to
17:23 be able to do these things effectively
17:26 where they actually learn these things
17:30 so the skills well
17:32 I'll ignore the data on or for a moment
17:35 like the data governance team the skills
17:37 that you have is actually I think the
17:40 biggest skill is so
17:42 you don't need to know all the
17:44 technology right so you don't have to be
17:46 super technical you need some kind of
17:48 business Affinity right but you also
17:51 need to be able to enable and manage
17:53 change right to be successful uh in
17:56 after people have to change processes
17:59 have to change so you need to be a
18:01 change enabler that that's probably
18:03 the the biggest skill you can have
18:06 working in their conferences how can I
18:09 change Behavior how can I make people
18:11 aware how can I evangelize in terms of
18:14 like art skills like pure knowledge
18:18 there's uh there's the um the DM DM book
18:22 so it's a Dharma Book of Knowledge I
18:25 believe and that's really like the unbox
18:29 it's really like the Bible for data
18:31 governance people
18:33 okay
18:34 so who's uh like you said like the
18:37 skills that they need is uh is change
18:40 management which does not sound like
18:43 something that
18:45 engineering like that computer science
18:48 courses cover at any University I know
18:52 so
18:53 um I guess these people do not
18:56 necessarily come from the computer
18:57 science background so what kind of
18:58 background
18:59 is actually the best like where do they
19:03 come from like you from the Consultants
19:05 the consultant space or
19:07 I've seen I mean I've seen data
19:10 governance people with all kinds of
19:11 backgrounds actually engineering uh
19:14 legal HR marketing
19:16 uh yeah
19:19 so it's not something you can learn in
19:21 school like I don't know when you finish
19:23 your school let's go learn about data
19:27 governance like and have a bachelor
19:29 degree in that
19:31 not that I'm aware of but I wouldn't be
19:33 surprised if that comes soon I mean
19:38 I guess it would be a specialization
19:40 right in some sort of yeah
19:46 you're saying
19:48 no I mean like I said it's really uh
19:51 fundamental I mean everybody has I was I
19:54 was on this uh I was a coalesce in
19:58 London last year you know a DPT
20:01 conference
20:02 this is about analytics engineering
20:04 right and there was the keynote uh and
20:09 after the keynote there was I was with
20:11 go farmers and the product manager of
20:13 DBT there was room for question a
20:15 question q a right
20:17 and half of the Q a were data governance
20:20 questions there were data governance
20:21 related because these were analytics
20:23 Engineers they were building on DBT and
20:25 they kind of
20:27 because they were focused on proving the
20:29 value of data right proving that you
20:33 know getting this initial data products
20:34 out those initial successes and then
20:37 they had success they get more and more
20:39 their consumers on the platform more and
20:41 more they have products in there and
20:43 then you start seeing all those data
20:44 governance issues and you know data
20:46 access management is really one of those
20:48 challenges that's why like you see that
20:50 with you know the data teams that have
20:53 proven value of data they're getting
20:56 more data consumer on the platform
20:57 they're they're successful in their
21:00 self-service analytics the number of
21:01 data products is exploding and then
21:03 regarding having all these data access
21:05 management issues right
21:06 and it said we did a government applies
21:09 to data access management now you got to
21:11 gradually you know mature your data
21:13 access management right you cannot just
21:16 say oh stop the process hold on
21:18 everybody stop doing self-service
21:20 analytics I gotta improve access my data
21:23 access management that doesn't work
21:24 that's too disruptive and that's also
21:27 like the approach for data access
21:29 management should be like just do it
21:32 incrementally don't have like a big bang
21:34 but incrementally
21:36 um improve your data access maturity
21:41 um and that's the same with data
21:42 government and that's why you need like
21:43 a good plan a good change agent that
21:46 allows you um to do that
21:49 mm-hmm
21:50 I understand what about those poor data
21:53 Engineers who work in a smaller
21:54 organizations that all of a sudden need
21:57 to deal with all these data access
21:59 requests I assume some of them might
22:02 naturally become interested in data
22:04 governance
22:05 so
22:06 how do they actually get better at that
22:08 like do they pick up the book you
22:10 mentioned this damn book or how do they
22:13 do this
22:14 there's a lot of content out there
22:17 there's also like several uh select
22:19 communities there's a data mesh Select
22:23 Community there's also the name escaping
22:25 there's also data governance a slack
22:27 Community where you can go on
22:31 um
22:31 so so definitely uh communities and
22:35 literature out there that can help you
22:37 yeah I think there is a book from
22:38 O'Reilly right that is called Data
22:40 governance
22:41 it can be yeah yeah I think we've had
22:44 authors like a couple of years ago on
22:47 this podcast so if anyone is listening
22:49 and did not check that maybe you can go
22:52 and check like just type data governance
22:55 because we
22:56 discussed it in much more details
23:01 okay but uh
23:03 so when is organization is when is
23:06 organization large enough to actually
23:08 start thinking about the data governance
23:10 team or it's more a question of maturity
23:13 or how does it happen
23:15 yeah
23:16 um
23:17 I think it depends on on several factors
23:21 but I think
23:22 uh
23:23 yeah
23:25 so what I see in practice is still this
23:27 is for organizations that are very
23:29 serious about data right so they have
23:31 customer data and they want to use it
23:34 for as a competitive asset asset right
23:37 so for better insights better Services
23:39 better products and so forth
23:42 then you have to really have the basis
23:44 of data governance to become successful
23:47 at that now
23:48 this is typically as of a certain size
23:50 if you're small right and you can just
23:53 talk to each other over your over over
23:55 the computer screen or over slack as
23:58 we're working from home now but as of a
24:01 certain size if you're serious about
24:03 data then you really need to invest
24:06 somewhat in in their governance
24:08 um because that as I said it's like the
24:11 fundamentals to become uh become
24:13 successful with data
24:15 like let's say a startup with 10 people
24:18 do they need data governance thing
24:22 well I mean no I don't think at that
24:24 station you data governance right you
24:26 all have the same definitions of the
24:27 data you understand the data flows
24:31 um even for data access management you
24:33 can just one person manage it it's when
24:35 you start getting more data consumers on
24:37 the platform when you start getting more
24:39 data products in there and you start
24:42 feeling like the issues like like people
24:45 not trusting the reports anymore there
24:48 are quality issues right you see like
24:50 the trust disappearing the trust fading
24:52 you get out of ad hoc requests you know
24:55 we have to kill or kill a lot of fires
24:59 that's when you know these are all
25:01 symptoms of a lack of data governance
25:04 let's say if we have data issues and we
25:07 already lost the trust and data is it
25:09 isn't it too late now to
25:11 to do this like should have we tried to
25:14 prevent it
25:16 yeah indeed
25:18 um
25:19 but I mean the priority is often let's
25:23 do the value of data first right in
25:25 theory yeah it should have been
25:26 prevented in practice I mean if you have
25:29 a limited budget and your
25:31 responsibilities you know prove that
25:33 there's value in data analytics you're
25:34 going to focus on that and when that
25:36 takes off you're going to improve your
25:37 data governance that's how it happens in
25:39 practice I would love to see the other
25:41 way around but that's how it is yeah so
25:44 I guess for a startup with 10 people
25:45 it's like at most two teams right
25:48 working together but let's say if there
25:51 is one team that is producing data and
25:53 then there are multiple teams that is
25:56 consuming this data
25:58 the moment you have some sensitive data
26:00 that only one team can consume and
26:02 others could not like I don't know some
26:04 personal identifiable data right then
26:06 you need to start thinking okay like how
26:08 do we make sure that this team can
26:11 have access to this data and this team
26:13 cannot right and then you need to start
26:15 thinking like how do we
26:17 keep this organized like how do we know
26:19 do not go I don't know Matt thinking
26:22 about all these things because like
26:23 there could be another field another
26:26 sensitive
26:27 sort of information that maybe just one
26:30 team can consume and it's a different
26:32 team
26:33 right
26:34 absolutely I mean I think any day access
26:38 management before you go for a steep
26:40 that's for sure right like if you're
26:42 soon as you have a data warehouse or a
26:46 lake and you have sensitive data in
26:48 there be it customer data or like
26:51 business critical data like very
26:52 sensitive intellectual property of
26:55 course then you need an access
26:56 management that's for sure and then and
26:59 then like you said if you start bringing
27:01 on more data consumers then you really
27:03 need it but then you need to do it in a
27:06 scalable way then you need to have like
27:07 automated process better insights better
27:10 collaboration and that's that's when you
27:13 have to start looking at you know taking
27:15 that responsibility and the processes
27:18 out of the core their team and then put
27:21 it either with the government scene that
27:22 typically around that size starts you
27:25 know developing you start getting your
27:26 first data Steward data governance
27:28 person or push it to the the data owners
27:33 um but if anything and data access
27:35 management that's one of the things when
27:38 you work with customer data one of the
27:39 data governance
27:42 like one of the parts of data governance
27:45 that you have to start as early as
27:46 possible with
27:48 and to mentioned the word process many
27:52 many times and I'm wondering how should
27:55 a good good enough process look like
27:57 look like if we talk about data access
27:59 management let's say we have producers
28:02 of data we have consumers of data some
28:04 of the data is sensitive so not everyone
28:06 should have access to that and one team
28:09 wants to have access to this data like
28:11 how do they go about
28:14 I don't know consuming starting to
28:16 consume this data yeah
28:19 I didn't I didn't realize I was talking
28:21 about process that much I must be I must
28:24 be getting old you know four times yeah
28:28 yeah well there's a there's a
28:31 um now there are many processes in data
28:33 this is my right you have like the
28:34 access request the approval you have the
28:37 regular review uh you have a revoking
28:39 accident so forth uh I I think it starts
28:43 with like good rules and
28:44 responsibilities right uh ideally and
28:47 this is for somewhat larger
28:48 organizations you need like a good
28:50 collaboration between the data owners
28:53 who know the business context of the
28:56 data who know what it means ideally they
28:58 approve access they manage accidentally
29:01 view it uh so the data owners they work
29:04 with the data Engineers they know the
29:06 technology they can they have to
29:08 implement the controls
29:11 um and then if you have a data
29:13 governance scheme that they should also
29:14 be involved because you know the
29:16 regulatory context within your working
29:18 so they know the privacy and security
29:20 standards and the policies in the
29:22 organization and ideally you had a
29:25 collaboration between these three and
29:27 what we've seen is that you know when
29:29 data access measure does not scale it's
29:30 because the collaboration between these
29:32 three has has broken
29:35 okay so I'm thinking it's a bit abstract
29:39 to me still let's take an example so for
29:42 example we have
29:43 a use case I don't know churn prediction
29:46 right so we have uh we're in a company
29:48 we have some clients it could be like a
29:51 usual uh internet SAS company right so
29:55 there's there's a customer team who
29:57 manages the all the information about
29:59 the customer like they their contact
30:02 details and so on and there is let's say
30:04 a marketing team that wants to
30:06 understand if somebody is about to churn
30:08 then we want to try to win them back by
30:11 offering some discounts right so the
30:13 marketing team wants to implement this
30:15 turn prediction
30:16 and they need to access the marketing
30:19 team needs access to the email field
30:21 right
30:22 so then uh how do they go about this if
30:25 we have proper data governance and data
30:28 access management tools you mentioned
30:30 like there are things like access
30:31 requests approval revoke right like it's
30:35 probably
30:36 um okay ask for a quest right how does
30:39 it happen yeah so ideally uh there's
30:43 this there's this concept of pushing
30:45 pushing governance left right so ideally
30:49 when the the data Engineers have created
30:52 the initial data set with the was it
30:54 customer email uh in there right yeah uh
30:58 they have uh dagged that data set a
31:01 customer email and they've also defined
31:04 the roles that can access that data set
31:06 so that's the customer team right so the
31:08 data engineers and the team that make
31:10 this data available yeah they it's their
31:13 responsibility to document this data to
31:15 say which fields which information is
31:19 sensitive which is not and who can
31:21 access what right yeah that's ideal and
31:23 that's when you start moving towards
31:25 data mesh data contracts right so the
31:28 data producers in in the sales team they
31:32 say this is data set the discussion data
31:34 these are the roles that can assume it
31:36 and then the marketing team they
31:39 basically when they need that data set
31:41 they find it in a catalog right and they
31:44 say hey I need access to this data set
31:47 the email field I need it for children
31:49 analysis so the login access request
31:51 with the purpose turn analysis right and
31:55 then access request is like they say
31:57 okay this is the field we're interested
32:00 in but we don't seem to have access to
32:02 this please give us and this is the
32:04 reason why we need it because we want to
32:06 do XYZ right yeah and then ideally also
32:09 like we only we need for three months or
32:12 or we need permanent but you also add
32:14 like the time Dimension and then if you
32:17 have a data owner in the sales domain
32:20 they approve it and then in ideal case
32:23 permissions are automatically updated
32:25 and then if that approval is for three
32:27 four months after that build the
32:30 permissions are revoked and that
32:32 revoking access is is really important
32:34 and what we've seen and a great deal and
32:38 this is pure data access mentioned their
32:40 Governors but one of the issues that we
32:42 see with data access environment is like
32:44 excessive privileges role explosion it
32:48 becomes way too difficult to to see who
32:51 has access to what or you have a lot of
32:54 excessive users with excessive
32:55 privileges that's because access is
32:57 always granted and not revoked and I
33:00 think now more than ever with public
33:02 cloud and all the data breaches and the
33:04 Privacy regulations but also the
33:06 upcoming security regulations in in
33:08 Europe and the same in the States you
33:11 need those concept of least privileged
33:13 access management so like time-bound
33:15 access is also like part of the best
33:17 practices I would say
33:20 and you're based in Europe right in
33:22 Belgium yes it's especially important to
33:26 know about all these things and in
33:28 Belgium the European commission is
33:29 actually there right so it's like Europe
33:30 or lament so all these laws about data
33:34 uh data privacy I actually made
33:38 somewhere near you right yeah yeah
33:40 that's those are my neighbors okay like
33:45 do you go do you have I don't know
33:46 grills with them
33:48 um
33:52 they're my neighbors but I got I got
33:55 them my friends are more other
33:56 entrepreneurs okay
34:00 um okay yeah and then um so I guess in
34:03 this case
34:05 if I request a temporal access if I say
34:07 hey I want to do a proof of concept I
34:10 want to see like if our term prediction
34:12 model is actually useful then you
34:14 request access for three months and then
34:16 if it's granted then automatically
34:18 whatever data access management tool we
34:21 use should
34:22 after three months revoke it right
34:24 but look at the the development cycle
34:28 right so typically it's like a data
34:30 engineer or data scientist a data
34:32 scientist in this case has to build a
34:34 new model they request access to that
34:36 data to build that model they get it for
34:39 a couple of months when the model is
34:40 built and it can go into production data
34:42 scientist doesn't need that data anymore
34:44 right I mean and every gift we give
34:47 access to the service account or the the
34:50 workbench that needs the data for the
34:53 chair prediction model and the access
34:55 for this scientists has been revoked and
34:58 I mean I'm always talking about privacy
35:00 and security you have many regulations
35:03 indeed why you have to limit access and
35:05 you also have sarbanes oxy and so forth
35:07 but also it just it prevents you from
35:09 making mistakes right it's like for a
35:12 lot of people having the guard rails
35:14 that prevents them from like deleting a
35:16 production table or whatever you can
35:18 also give a peace of mind so there's
35:20 there's a lot of benefits in just like
35:21 working with temporary access and
35:23 knowing then that like when I do
35:25 something wrong because I didn't have my
35:27 coffee in the morning I mean I have my
35:28 peace of mind that no that is somewhat
35:31 limited to the access that I have
35:34 well as a data scientist in the past I
35:37 can
35:39 think of ways where it could potentially
35:41 go wrong maybe there's a solution so for
35:43 example okay we implemented a proof of
35:45 concept we decided to go ahead with this
35:48 it's in reduction right now and I no
35:51 longer have access to this data right
35:52 because why do I need access to emails
35:54 of the customers but something happens
35:56 with our model it gets broken right and
35:59 then I need to go and debug it and
36:01 figure out what's wrong and then if I
36:04 don't have access to this data
36:06 how do I actually debug it yeah yeah and
36:10 I mean I don't want to go too much into
36:13 the writers solution because that's we
36:16 cover all that stuff with writer and I
36:17 don't want to make it a sales pitch
36:18 right but there ideally you get access
36:21 to do your investigation right and and
36:24 and
36:25 yeah it's a process of currently the
36:28 what is broken is a process of
36:30 requesting getting access and revoking
36:33 access it the process does not work and
36:35 that's why as a data scientist I'm sure
36:37 in your experience that
36:39 um like say I'm sure you've had admin
36:43 credit rights right they were just like
36:44 Alexa leave me alone here are admin
36:46 rights do your thing right and that's
36:48 because the the process is broken right
36:50 we just have to improve the process of
36:52 requesting approving and revoking access
36:55 such that at all times you only have
36:57 access to the data that you need whether
36:59 it's to build a model to run a model
37:01 investigate data quality issues or why
37:04 the model has broken and nothing else
37:06 but just getting requesting an X and
37:09 getting the model should be easy right
37:12 and it automated where possible so at
37:15 all time it just limited to what you
37:17 really need
37:19 well in defense of the company where I
37:21 worked we actually had the data
37:24 Protection Officer so I was not always
37:25 giving up in rates
37:27 maybe speaking about this data
37:30 protection I remember having a
37:31 discussion with that person like when I
37:32 needed to access
37:36 yeah I think some senses of information
37:37 like emails
37:40 like all of a sudden I got to know this
37:43 person data Protection Officer because
37:45 he was pretty interested in why I need
37:47 this data and I needed to explain him
37:48 yeah
37:50 so do you see this role often this data
37:53 Protection Officer
37:55 um
37:56 I see them as an important stakeholder
37:59 so I see companies I was talking to that
38:02 were
38:04 where you see that the data access
38:06 mentioned
38:07 projects actually started because DPO
38:11 was concerned or the season is concerned
38:14 I mean it's a responsibility it actually
38:17 like it's an organization's
38:19 responsibility to keep their customer
38:21 data private and secure a good example
38:24 is uh Optus in Australia that has been
38:27 breached a couple of months back they
38:29 lost 10 percent of their customer base
38:31 after that breach right so I mean
38:33 customers are are becoming more and more
38:36 privacy aware so as an organization of
38:39 course you have to take that
38:41 responsibility but it's often driven by
38:43 the DPO who has to comply with the
38:45 Privacy recognitions they have to say to
38:47 the supervisor right they have to report
38:50 on that they have to
38:51 Delta supervisor and the customer hey we
38:54 only use the data for the purposes that
38:56 we've agreed upon and then the Caesar
38:58 has to make sure that there are no data
39:00 breaches no data leaks they have to
39:01 prevent unauthorized access and you know
39:04 for operational systems that's pretty
39:07 straightforward right but when you look
39:09 at your data warehouses your data Lakes
39:13 that's where you know they lose sleep
39:16 because you got all that data it's messy
39:18 it's a lot of data you got a lot of
39:21 change and there you have to you know
39:22 prevent an authorized access and you
39:26 know data scientists data analysts data
39:28 Engineers that have to do their job they
39:29 need that access and they have to but on
39:33 the other hand you have to comply with
39:34 privacy and security regulations and
39:36 that balance you know doing your job
39:37 being productive for data giving your
39:40 company that Competitive Edge with data
39:42 while you know keeping it secure and
39:45 private that's a very difficult battle
39:47 and then creates that friction that you
39:50 know your DPO your previous job like
39:52 being like hey what do you need the data
39:53 do you really need it for that purpose
39:55 can you explain me
39:57 I would ask that these questions all day
40:00 long yeah and sucks it sucks for
40:03 everybody right because then you have to
40:05 explain them they're not all dpos are
40:08 very technical they're often more
40:10 working with legal texts with policies
40:13 so there's this like miscommunication
40:15 and it just it's policy so that it
40:18 shouldn't it should be automated as much
40:20 as possible the collaboration between
40:22 the DPO and the data team should be
40:24 streamlined as much as possible you need
40:26 to have give them the insights and just
40:29 like in enable it right rather than
40:31 policing
40:33 oh
40:34 I was also curious I actually mentioned
40:37 two things so you we talked about DPO
40:39 but he also mentioned seesaw ciso
40:42 whatever so maybe you can tell us a bit
40:44 about these roles these roles like who
40:46 are these people usually what's their
40:49 job is and why do companies actually
40:51 employ them like why do they care about
40:53 them yeah so there typically as of a
40:57 certain size
40:58 um so when you're working with sensitive
41:00 data and yes of your as of a certain
41:03 size you will typically see a data
41:05 privacy officer or DPO and a ciso or
41:09 Chief Information a security officer
41:13 um what I've seen is that they've grown
41:15 towards each other right
41:17 um so they used to be like two
41:18 completely separate entities now they
41:21 collaborate more closely and that's
41:23 because the DPO has to rely on a season
41:25 what does a DPO do it makes sure that
41:29 you know the data that you as a customer
41:31 give to organization is only used for
41:35 the purposes you've agreed upon right so
41:37 if I give you my data uh to you know for
41:41 billing for sending invoices and I say
41:44 you cannot use it for marketing I hope I
41:46 don't get marketing emails from you that
41:48 would create a speech and that's not
41:51 always that big but you also have like a
41:54 Northwest access or used by Third
41:57 Parties by hackers and that's where the
41:58 Caesar comes in so Caesar makes sure
42:01 that you know no unauthorized users or
42:05 unauthorized people can have access to
42:07 your data so they keep everything secure
42:09 your DPO makes sure that the data is
42:13 being used in in a way and in the
42:15 context that you as a customer can
42:17 rightly expect
42:19 yeah yeah thanks I noticed that we have
42:22 three questions I think it's about time
42:24 we covered that question from IOP I hope
42:27 you I pronounce your name correctly so
42:29 the question is
42:31 how to deal with access management in a
42:33 data managed setup with sensitive data
42:35 usually data producers own it but for
42:37 sensitive data even producers shouldn't
42:40 access it I don't know maybe we covered
42:43 it a little bit the first part of this
42:47 also like not everyone knows what data
42:50 mesh is maybe you can introduce it in
42:51 like a just a couple of sentences yeah
42:54 uh great question I know by the way uh
42:57 so first off data mesh it's a new
42:59 framework uh it comes from thoughtworks
43:02 from jamac and it basically applies like
43:05 best practices from devops and data
43:07 governance and applies it to data there
43:10 are four principles so I don't know by
43:12 heart I think it's data as a product uh
43:16 domain thinking self-service analytics
43:18 and Federate computational governance
43:20 not not 100 certain that we had Sean
43:24 Mark also in one of the interviews so
43:26 you can check it out
43:28 just maybe enough I think maybe it's
43:30 enough information to for those who
43:33 don't know what it is
43:34 just go and check that one indeed
43:38 Mark will do much better job than I and
43:40 I just did
43:42 um but that's a great pointy obey so
43:44 like like said uh often it's uh that the
43:48 data producers or the data owners that
43:50 decide on who can have access to what
43:51 but there's this point of sensitive data
43:54 because you know that has to comply with
43:56 privacy regulations security standards
43:58 and support the way that we see that
44:00 writer is uh that should still be
44:03 controlled by your central data
44:05 governance team that knows the
44:06 regulations knows the Privacy standards
44:09 and should be as as much as possible
44:11 automated and that we're looking at you
44:13 know column level masking or Road level
44:16 filtering where based on the central
44:18 policies these columns are automatically
44:21 massed so a good example is like
44:23 marketing has a data sets customer data
44:26 they say based on their policy so John
44:29 and Mary can access this data set I
44:31 approve access but in that data set it's
44:34 like payment card information or home
44:36 address then there should be Central
44:37 policy that says like this comp should
44:40 always be missed and that's something
44:42 that should be automated as much as
44:44 possible we call we call this by the way
44:47 we call this the the Conway Benson
44:50 movement where both teams collaborate on
44:52 that topic great question
44:55 yeah another question from the same
44:56 person and we spoke already about this
45:00 role explosion that's when we have too
45:03 many roles maybe when we forget to
45:05 revoke access uh
45:07 and the question is do you have any
45:09 recommendations for following the least
45:11 privileged privileged access principles
45:13 without filing in failing into the role
45:17 explosion problem when there is a role
45:19 dedicated for each private data set
45:21 uh there's a role for each data set
45:24 right I see
45:26 um tough question so
45:29 um what I've seen is that role explosion
45:32 typically comes when your roles divert
45:35 from how the business uses
45:37 um data so a couple of things there is
45:41 like we we see work with organizations
45:44 that have like the wall inheritance they
45:46 have the data roles that give you low
45:48 level permissions on data sets reads
45:51 permissions write permissions and so
45:53 forth and then you have the functional
45:55 roles that correspond to your roles in
45:57 the business that you can then assume
45:59 the data roles right so that's one way
46:03 another reason for role explosion is
46:06 like the access requests right so people
46:08 request access for you know building an
46:11 ml model for investigating issues
46:13 there's no role that matches that
46:15 request perfectly so what you typically
46:17 do is then just create quickly new one
46:19 and then forget to revoke it so I think
46:21 like regular reviews and alerts for
46:24 unused rules will definitely help with
46:27 that so I think like having like the the
46:30 role inheritance where you have roles
46:32 that mention business and roles that
46:34 match the data combined with regular
46:36 reviews and alerts on unusuals I think
46:39 that should should help
46:42 thank you make sense and another
46:44 question is uh and I've been sort of
46:47 guilty of that too
46:48 oftentimes data owners do not know if
46:51 the data is sensitive or not and or
46:53 maybe they accidentally may make made a
46:55 mistake
46:56 so how to make sure that we have the
46:58 right process to catch
47:01 pii data personal identifiable
47:03 information because I happen to be a
47:06 data owner at some point
47:07 and producing data and then I just
47:10 didn't realize that some of these data
47:12 is actually private sensitive and then
47:15 somebody pointed out they discovered
47:18 they accidentally so there was no
47:21 process for that and then of course I
47:23 went to our data catalog and then Mark
47:25 this uh feel this sensitive so is there
47:29 a process for that like how do you you
47:31 deal with this kind of problems yeah
47:34 that is really uh the best way to
47:37 address this is by integrating
47:38 governance in your data of this process
47:40 so uh once I was talking to this guy
47:44 like UC need a data engineering team at
47:47 a Woolworths in Australia like 200
47:49 people and he said you know when I
47:51 started integrating data governance in
47:53 my data Ops the effort became one
47:55 percent of what it used to be right so
47:57 as you're creating data products you add
48:00 the tags and then based on those Stacks
48:03 you can have like an automated decision
48:04 process that mask sensitive data
48:08 um so ideally yeah the data is stagged
48:11 that's the ideal scenario and then data
48:14 is automatically messed based on on
48:17 those tags
48:19 um but of course you always need like a
48:21 regular review right so I think having
48:23 good insights in who has access to what
48:26 what are the usage patterns and you know
48:28 showing that in an easy to consume way
48:31 would also be very important to catch
48:34 issues like like that
48:38 but I guess the question was also about
48:39 like if I accidentally
48:42 Mark data is not sensitive even though
48:44 it is sensitive
48:45 uh what is their way to automatically
48:49 detect that or like it's just we need to
48:52 work on processes maybe we just need to
48:54 have regular reviews
48:56 uh so about the tagging itself right uh
48:59 I think they're looking at like
49:02 there's now this concept of active
49:04 metadata where the data is actively
49:07 automatically is actively managed like
49:09 you have a lot of automation there
49:10 models to help you with the tagging
49:14 um not really my field of expertise but
49:17 I think there there are several
49:18 Solutions out there that help you know
49:21 with automated data tagging and that
49:24 could help you with that
49:26 because like maybe
49:28 well with emails addresses phone numbers
49:31 IP addresses and geographical
49:33 coordinates it's kind of obvious right
49:35 like they follow more or less the same
49:37 pattern so they are probably automatic
49:38 ways to oh yeah
49:41 yeah so these models that are out there
49:43 they can indeed you know use regex
49:46 patterns to detect sensitive data but
49:48 they can also use at the context of the
49:50 the the data itself look at the actual
49:53 values and add tags in that way and
49:57 there's a whole field that has been
49:58 developing in that space over the past
50:01 couple of years so some of them are even
50:03 open source so definitely some sort of
50:05 solutions out there to help with that
50:07 now I want to talk about instrumenting
50:10 all everything we talked about
50:12 what I typically see in companies is we
50:15 have tools like terraform that or even
50:18 before telephone so we have like all
50:20 these clouds like for example AWS cloud
50:22 and in ABS we have this thing called IM
50:26 which is
50:29 identity and access management yeah yeah
50:31 right and then what typically happens is
50:35 we use this infrastructure it's called
50:37 tools such as terraform or cloud
50:39 formation all that so that there is like
50:42 this infrastructure team that manages
50:44 this this code base
50:47 and if I need access to something I need
50:50 to poke these people saying hey can you
50:52 please like I have a role or my team has
50:55 a role
50:56 and then like I need to like I want to
50:58 have access to this S3 bucket so I need
51:00 to poke them first and then I say okay
51:02 we're too busy just create a pull
51:04 request to this thing so then I go and I
51:06 need to manage to make sure that I can
51:08 actually you know run this thing on my
51:09 computer and then maybe I add this uh to
51:13 to the terraform file then I create a
51:15 pull request and they take some time to
51:17 review this pull request somebody needs
51:18 to approve it so then somebody approves
51:20 it and somebody needs to apply it and
51:22 then like maybe one month later I
51:25 finally have access if everything goes
51:26 smoothly I guess that's not the most
51:29 ideal scenario right but from my
51:32 experience I see that often this is how
51:34 it starts
51:36 right that's correct that's indeed how
51:38 it starts
51:40 um I think it's a good way to get
51:42 started is with terraform because you
51:45 know most their teams like I said a bit
51:47 earlier right it's all about you know
51:49 proving the value first so you're really
51:51 focused on getting those First Data
51:53 products out you know improving the
51:55 value of a data analytics getting more
51:57 their consumers on there more their
51:59 products in also on the platform
52:02 um and then that initial terraform
52:04 script that you used to manage accident
52:07 requests and process to request access
52:09 to a slack or email they start breaking
52:12 right it doesn't scale
52:14 um that's because you know one it's too
52:16 technical so for data owners to take
52:19 ownership right they can't go in in the
52:21 terraform code and start managing access
52:23 so it keeps on being with the core data
52:25 team so too technical uh if by the time
52:29 you have a DPO or CSO there's no way of
52:31 reporting there's no Insight so the
52:33 visit there's no visibility and there's
52:36 hardly any automation right so you
52:38 cannot automatically uh approve or
52:41 revoke access
52:43 um and trees like an issue I I heard at
52:46 a at a tech scale up was that they had
52:49 State drift in their access controls
52:51 right so they had access defined in
52:53 terraform and it was different from what
52:56 actually was in Snowflake because other
52:57 Engineers were just directly update the
52:59 probation in the snowflake so I think
53:01 it's a great way to get started uh it
53:04 just you know gets gets you started you
53:06 don't have to worry about access
53:07 management that is covered as of a
53:09 certain scale that's when you start
53:11 looking at more uh like like vendors
53:13 like right to help you manage
53:15 permissions and the ways we just build
53:17 on top of that right so I really believe
53:20 in excess code as much as possible so
53:23 like pushing governance left my vision
53:26 it's like let's just keep defining data
53:29 products as code and the roles that can
53:31 access your data products as code but
53:33 then everything access requests the
53:35 management of the reporting let's do
53:37 that in a dedicated tool like writer
53:39 where everybody can go to request access
53:41 and your data engines are just taken out
53:44 of the process they can focus on cool
53:46 stuff another processing access requests
53:49 so I'm I want to I don't I see that we
53:53 don't have a lot of time like five
53:54 minutes I still want to talk about
53:55 writer but I'm just wondering so
53:57 Engineers being engineers and I'm one of
53:59 them too
54:00 uh why do I need a vendor if I just can
54:03 implement this thing myself it's so much
54:04 fun right
54:05 yeah yeah uh the the building is indeed
54:10 fun uh the maintaining uh sucks uh you
54:13 have to update your connectors all the
54:14 time it becomes costly but then also
54:16 just for your employer right it's
54:19 security it is important and I've seen
54:22 I've seen several cases where the
54:24 engineer that built it left and just
54:27 nobody maintained it he left with all
54:28 the knowledge they get huge key person
54:30 risk and on something as important as a
54:33 data access management it's uh it's not
54:36 a it's not ideal
54:38 so how do you solve this problem what do
54:41 they actually do yeah so the the biggest
54:44 challenge with implementing data access
54:46 management is a change right people have
54:49 to you know change their behaviors
54:51 change their process and maybe even
54:52 tools so the the way that we do it is by
54:57 you know limiting the change that it
54:59 needs on gradually improving data access
55:02 management and the way I do it we do
55:04 that is by you know we let you start
55:06 from your as a situation so there's no
55:09 big bang change you don't have to
55:10 disrupt anything we come in and with our
55:13 we have a free version of the product
55:15 uh you integrate with your data
55:18 warehouse or your data Lake and from the
55:19 first day you instantly see who has
55:21 access to what what is the usage right
55:24 and then from that place so from your
55:26 ads is you can gradually Implement uh or
55:30 improve your access controls through
55:31 collaboration the insights and
55:34 Automation and that is uh
55:37 um like the opposite of what the other
55:39 vendors do which is like okay first
55:41 Define your policies your metadata uh
55:44 and then push down all that change and
55:46 it breaks a lot there's a lot of change
55:48 uh all at once so that big bang is
55:51 something we don't believe in we believe
55:52 in like the gradual implementation
55:55 other open source Alternatives like if
55:58 somebody is not really or somebody just
56:00 want to make sure they see all the code
56:03 and you know
56:06 yeah
56:07 so we have a right to CLI that is open
56:10 source that you can manage access code
56:13 now uh we have our first contributor who
56:17 is building out the the report
56:19 capabilities so super happy for that uh
56:23 in terms of other open source what we
56:25 see all the time is Easter
56:29 what their form has all these issues
56:32 that we talked about right yeah indeed
56:34 indeed
56:35 well since you have an open source thing
56:38 we have a we have um I think called open
56:41 source Spotlight where we invite open
56:43 source authors to demo their tools and
56:46 you are more than welcome to demo right
56:48 or CLI so we also recognize something
56:52 I think that's all we have time for
56:54 today so thanks Bart for joining us
56:57 today for sharing all this information
56:58 with us and thanks everyone for joining
57:01 in for listening for asking questions
57:03 and yeah I guess that's all thanks part
57:07 thank you thanks for having me
57:09 okay well see you soon I guess I don't
57:12 know if it will be you or somebody else
57:13 from your team presenting right or CLI
57:15 but I'm looking forward to that
57:17 that will be uh that will be our devrel
57:20 okay that works okay awesome thank you
