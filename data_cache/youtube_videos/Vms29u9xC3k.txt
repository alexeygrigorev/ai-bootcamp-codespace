0:43 slack community if you want to hang out
0:45 with other data enthusiasts check it out
0:48 there is a link in the description
0:50 and we have a machine learning
0:51 engineering course starting soon so if
0:53 you want to learn more about the
0:56 machinery engineering
0:57 check the link in the description
0:59 and it's free so check it out in it's
1:02 pretty long it's not easy but it's

1:17 during the interview
1:18 so
1:19 that's
1:21 all the introduction i have so now i
1:23 need to
1:25 get the questions
1:27 so okay
1:29 here are the questions
1:31 you probably have the copy of the
1:32 questions nearby somewhere too or you
1:34 know actually actually actually i
1:36 haven't but it's a good point
1:38 do you need
1:40 no i i i don't i i think uh yeah just
1:44 i'm just trying to watch the time
1:45 because i'm i have a tendency to be very
1:48 transparent but that could also include
1:51 explaining too much uh so yeah i'm just
1:54 watching the time a bit more
1:57 okay so let's start
2:01 so this week we'll talk about
2:04 machine learning and data at
2:06 enterprises so we have a special guest
2:09 today alexandra so alexander is
2:11 responsible for data and artificial
2:12 intelligence at the consultancy called
2:15 keonix back i hope i pronounced it
2:17 correctly my german is perfectly
2:19 yeah
2:20 i've lived in germany for some time so i
2:22 think now i can pronounce this uh umlaut
2:25 so um
2:27 but you might know alexander not from
2:29 his work at keonexpect but from his
2:31 involvement in the pi data community so
2:33 he's one of the organizers or probably i
2:36 should say chairs of the pi data
2:38 conference the conference i think this
2:40 is one of the
2:41 this is the biggest conference the data
2:42 conference in berlin
2:45 my favorite conference
2:47 this a couple of months ago like i was
2:49 in the conference it was in brilliant
2:51 was like really awesome conference
2:53 and actually from these conferences i
2:55 invited a couple of people to this
2:57 podcast
2:58 and alexander is one of them so i'm very
3:00 happy
3:01 that you joined us today so welcome
3:05 yeah thanks for having me
3:07 yeah so before we go into our main topic
3:10 of
3:11 doing machine learning at enterprises
3:14 let's start with your background can you
3:16 tell us about your career journey so far
3:19 oh it's a long story actually and
3:20 actually starts like here
3:23 with the records uh actually like i
3:26 i used to study the law actually so
3:28 actually i hated it in school like
3:29 pascal i thought that was like super
3:31 boring
3:32 and i couldn't put used to it so
3:34 actually um i was a music enthusiast um
3:37 in the 90s uh
3:39 finally i i was djing finally i was
3:41 co-owner of the record record company
3:45 and the company was actually doing
3:46 pretty good and there was no software
3:48 around so that's why you have so many uh
3:51 records on your background
3:53 yeah actually advertising
3:55 yes actually from those days yeah and
3:59 and so actually uh
4:01 so i have a tendency to make every stuff
4:03 i'm passionate about and i care about
4:05 also into my profession so it's very
4:07 similar with data and programming and
4:09 python later on and actually like
4:12 the record company did pretty good and
4:15 we had administration problems there was
4:17 no software around so
4:19 i had to build it or i decided to build
4:21 it and so i taught myself programming
4:23 with two books at that time so it's yeah
4:27 and from there it goes so the record
4:29 company didn't really survive the big
4:31 crisis at the turn of the millennium uh
4:34 but it wasn't too bad because i was
4:37 moving into um programming uh and as
4:40 soon as a whole
4:42 everything about machine learning
4:44 started i was just super excited took
4:46 all the courses i could get and yeah and
4:49 decided to move on to the field of
4:51 machine learning and ai
4:55 yeah
4:56 and so now you work as a partner at
4:59 koenigsegg
5:00 so what does it mean to do to be a
5:03 partner and what do you do as a partner
5:06 as a partner of course i'm responsible
5:08 for my team with the team working on
5:11 data and ai topics to look for no new
5:14 people uh of course because the clinic's
5:17 week is growing so
5:18 i always look for support in projects if
5:21 it's freelancers or also people to
5:25 employees or
5:27 of course we have to
5:30 as a partner have to think about what's
5:31 our strategy what's which
5:35 products should we focus on which
5:37 services because it's uh it's a very
5:39 broad field and so we always try to
5:42 narrow it down and uh
5:44 we we have a tendency to like to work uh
5:47 cutting edge state of the art so just
5:49 like implementing boring stuff isn't
5:51 isn't probably not our thing of course
5:53 some it's very often
5:55 part of an a more exciting project but
5:58 um yeah so this is this is
6:01 my work and so being also like a partner
6:05 and a founder of boutique consultancy
6:08 and yeah that's
6:10 that's it's fun
6:12 because it gives you also like a lot of
6:13 freedom
6:14 to decide
6:16 whether what do you want to work on
6:18 which people do we want to work with and
6:21 this is not only like people we want to
6:23 bring in our team uh it it's also like
6:26 clients so we we would not accept any
6:29 client we say okay that's not a good
6:31 company culture
6:33 it's uh it's probably yeah it's not they
6:35 don't really share those same values so
6:37 we we wouldn't just do it for the money
6:39 we would just like say no it's not a
6:41 good fit because we like to get things
6:43 done and not
6:44 and not change lifetime against money
6:47 because that's just a waste
6:49 yeah i'm just also curious about the
6:51 word partner so like i work at the
6:53 product company and we usually i don't
6:56 know
6:57 chief technical officer or vp of
6:59 engineering so partner is not something
7:02 we use as a term as a
7:05 job role so this is i guess more common
7:08 to consultant consultancies and also to
7:11 law firms right so people who
7:13 do services for other companies right
7:16 and here partner a partner means that
7:18 you're responsible for an area
7:21 correct for by of the company like right
7:24 here as a partner you're
7:26 driving you're driving a certain area uh
7:30 in in the company you're responsible for
7:32 that and of course with all the support
7:34 from other partners so it's not
7:38 we collaborate on things all the time
7:40 but it's it's yeah it's
7:42 it's it's like
7:43 i'm running a department but i can
7:45 decide um where i want to move so
7:48 there's nobody uh
7:50 except for like we meet as partners we
7:53 meet and discuss things we should do or
7:55 work well but it's not nobody can tell
7:58 me if we should focus uh on mlaps as we
8:02 are doing now or if we should do
8:04 implement some other things uh so this
8:07 is basically my call to make and
8:10 yeah
8:11 so basically the company consists of
8:13 many independent you know units like uh
8:17 uh and each unit is led by a partner
8:19 right and you're
8:20 a leader of your particular unit yeah so
8:23 basically but there's not too many so
8:25 there's only five partners so yeah okay
8:28 it's it's it's not like and because we
8:30 also like
8:32 we we don't we currently grow and we
8:34 especially grow in the field of data and
8:36 ai and financial services um but for us
8:40 it's it's it's very important to work on
8:42 stuff we care about as well so
8:45 and there's a lot of stuff you could do
8:47 but it's too boring
8:50 but i imagine that this is not a simple
8:52 work not an easy work right so you need
8:54 to do a lot of stuff you need to talk to
8:56 clients you need to think what should be
8:58 the strategy what you should focus on
8:59 then you also have people who report to
9:01 you
9:03 and that's what you do as a managing
9:05 partner of company but that's just one
9:07 thing and i also know that you do a lot
9:09 of other things outside of your
9:11 let's say work
9:13 so you're a chair at bicone paidata
9:16 berlin conference right you're doing
9:18 many other things and i also checked
9:20 your github profile so i have a link so
9:22 i went there i checked it and i saw that
9:24 it's quite an active profile
9:26 so how do you manage to do all that so
9:28 yeah managing partners actually i
9:30 community
9:31 i don't have other hobbies
9:34 no
9:36 i have a tendency things i care about to
9:40 make it or like combine it with my work
9:43 um
9:44 because for me yeah and the community is
9:47 part of that i i enjoy the community i
9:50 love especially in the python community
9:53 i love the input i love the
9:56 community is has a very very healthy
9:59 country uh
10:00 it's
10:01 it's also but it's quite broad from the
10:04 topics you can find you can find it
10:05 astronomers you can find web developers
10:07 and i think this is a very
10:10 very good mix too because i i believe in
10:13 learning cross domain is
10:15 is a very good thing to see people's who
10:19 work on very different topics to learn
10:22 hey you have a similar problem for
10:23 example if you have image problems talk
10:26 to astronomers because they they have
10:28 real image problems
10:30 and they solve them already and they
10:31 solved them probably with way less
10:33 hardware than other people uh throw at
10:36 it in the cloud and i think that's
10:38 always like it's important to to keep
10:40 the exchange going of course there's
10:41 always like a lot of interest from
10:43 academia what academia can also learn
10:46 from business or like business
10:47 experiences so and and i just like go
10:50 like to go to conferences talk to people
10:53 and yeah it's it's it's always very
10:57 enlightening and and joyful and uh i
11:00 like the atmosphere that
11:03 there are no stupid questions culture
11:05 i'm i'm and this is one thing i i preach
11:08 everywhere also clients like there are
11:10 no stupid questions
11:13 how did you become a chair like i guess
11:16 well so you mentioned when you became
11:17 interested in machine learning you took
11:20 all the questions about this you found
11:22 and i guess at the same time you started
11:23 to look for local meet ups local
11:25 communities you started attending all
11:28 these uh meetups right and one of the
11:30 meetups local meetups so this is how you
11:32 became a chair right so you stand
11:34 actually it was just like an accident
11:37 it's just like actually actually i i
11:39 joined my first pycon was in cologne
11:42 2013
11:44 um
11:45 and
11:46 this was my first python community
11:48 experience and i decided to go to europe
11:49 and then build it just like across
11:52 in the bcc again where we have the
11:53 conference now
11:55 and i heard about the european society
11:57 and uh yeah i said okay let's go there
11:59 it's free and then they were looking for
12:01 an auditor um and i said okay auditing
12:04 books your python at that time was like
12:05 to audit like 10 10
12:08 10 invoices a year so it was the
12:11 conference was still run by the local
12:12 community so it wasn't
12:14 actually a lot of workloads okay i can i
12:16 can do it so if nobody else wants i can
12:18 throw myself in them so i met a lot of
12:21 people
12:22 i've i i interacted with a lot of people
12:24 i've never met in my life with email and
12:27 we were building the billboard
12:28 conference and uh then basically when i
12:32 came to bilbao it's the first time i
12:33 meet like i met like alexavio christian
12:36 barra and many others who have been
12:38 working on the bilbao conference and if
12:40 you had asked me beforehand can you
12:43 organize like a 1200 person conference
12:46 no no by email remotely i would have
12:49 said no way
12:51 actually it worked pretty well um and so
12:54 it was a great conference it really
12:55 worked and and while we were building
12:57 the pro because
12:58 20
12:59 the billboard conference was a reset for
13:01 europe python to run in a different
13:03 fashion and so basically everything was
13:05 just like
13:07 reorganizing and so actually while we
13:10 were building the process i ended up
13:12 being program chair with alexavio
13:15 and
13:16 so yeah and from there goes and i i like
13:20 i like to
13:22 i don't really would say i would like to
13:24 organize but i think like like getting
13:27 making things happen is very powerful
13:29 and of course conference gives you a lot
13:32 of
13:32 room for creativity to try new things
13:35 out and and it's also like and you see
13:38 okay it resonates with the community you
13:40 help people you help people who don't
13:42 not at the conference by recording the
13:44 videos and getting everything
13:46 together and yeah so
13:49 i quite like that and so i just stayed
13:51 on europe and and from there just like
13:54 went on one euro python and sebastian
13:57 and uh
13:58 um and peter from castro nearby they
14:00 came oh we should bring pike on the e to
14:03 castro and i said it's like that's like
14:06 it's a very connected area here so
14:09 we run pi data so invest in mannheim
14:11 heidelberg nowadays and so it's very
14:14 close and they said hey do you want to
14:15 help you have the experience from your
14:16 presence said yeah of course
14:19 this is how i was became part of the
14:21 the uh
14:23 german conference and actually i was
14:25 just like helping a little bit on your
14:27 sci-fi and then the program share left
14:29 and then valerio mucho just like wrote
14:31 in the telegram from alex should do it
14:33 and i said i want not but so um
14:37 so that's why i ended up like being
14:39 involved in many conferences but it's uh
14:41 it's basically not my plan so to die i
14:44 more think about how can uh how can i
14:47 not be involved in so many conferences
14:50 because we also need no i think we also
14:52 have to consider we need to make room
14:55 for fresh blog fresh ideas and
14:58 and so i'm i'm currently just working on
15:01 the european summit for organizers in
15:04 november because of course organizing
15:08 conferences and everything is a lot of
15:10 work on
15:11 and on very few shoulders and
15:14 and i've been investigating is
15:16 is is it different has everybody ever
15:19 figured out running a conference not
15:21 being core organizers be basically
15:23 burned out
15:24 and i haven't found one yet so if
15:26 somebody from the audience knows one
15:29 please contact me because
15:31 we we need to find new structures
15:33 because the community is growing the
15:35 conferences is growing
15:37 the the experience we want to provide to
15:40 um the
15:42 communities is is growing so
15:45 we we need to rethink how we organize
15:48 and work on conferences because it
15:50 depends on too few
15:53 and people
15:53 have to you have to work on that so
15:55 that's why uh we are euro python i'm
15:58 organizing a summit in november and
16:00 we will invite organizers from all over
16:03 europe and discuss and also how can we
16:05 help each other
16:07 by mentoring
16:09 and standardizing some processes because
16:11 very often in the conference we have to
16:14 local communities or new people reinvent
16:16 the wheel
16:17 for the fifth time and so maybe we can
16:20 help that because it's
16:22 it's it's a problem yeah
16:24 so if anyone is interested please
16:26 contact alexander yes and if you want to
16:28 help on conferences
16:31 or who knows maybe you wouldn't become
16:33 the next chair of pi date by called in
16:36 berlin right
16:38 anyways
16:40 so
16:41 i i also notice so when doing a little
16:44 bit of research that you're a very
16:45 active speaker so not only you speak at
16:48 like all these events you organize well
16:49 maybe not on all of them but your quote
16:52 like your talks uh appear often and then
16:55 actually like in google you can
16:58 put in a name and then look for videos
17:00 right there is a special tab so when i
17:02 did this with your name
17:04 i found
17:06 604 results so did you actually do 600
17:10 for no actually i think it's it's
17:12 probably playlists or something else so
17:15 actually i think it's a lot i haven't
17:18 stopped i have stopped counting uh but i
17:20 think it should be something like a
17:22 hundred so i i am planning to recount
17:24 soon because maybe the hundreds talk
17:27 should be something a little more
17:29 special
17:30 so yeah it's uh yeah it just added adds
17:33 up during the years
17:36 it's none of this i'm asking is well
17:38 some of this is what we prepared but i'm
17:41 really curious like because i find
17:43 problems sometimes getting inspiration
17:45 like okay i probably have done something
17:48 interesting
17:49 but how do i package this as a talk like
17:51 how do i find uh how do i share this how
17:54 do i
17:56 you know find materials to talk about
17:59 like this is a problem for me so for you
18:01 like with 100 talks you probably found
18:04 like a way for you to generate
18:07 talk proposals maybe you can share no
18:09 not at all actually
18:11 every time i propose a talk and when i
18:13 finally have to prepare it i hate myself
18:15 so why are we doing this to myself i i i
18:18 lack time and of course for me it's
18:21 important to deliver quality talks so
18:24 it's uh it's it's i don't just don't
18:25 want to say okay it's a talk and it's
18:27 some topic or like just like something
18:29 like uh
18:31 something people have seen
18:33 before or something like that um
18:35 so it's it's of course um
18:38 i i can narrow it down to a very simple
18:40 formula if you have something to say you
18:42 don't have to worry what you are talking
18:44 talk to talk about and a lot of
18:47 um
18:48 a lot of the
18:51 things what should i talk about is it
18:52 good enough i can just like if people
18:54 think it's just in your head i'm sure
18:56 you have like five topics you can talk
18:59 about and share your share insights and
19:02 and and with the community and it
19:04 doesn't have to be like
19:06 the latest hype or like tech so yeah
19:09 just like discuss things you learned
19:12 when i do talks
19:13 about something new and it's not only me
19:15 actually i i i'm being programmed to
19:17 have many conferences i know many
19:19 speakers of course
19:21 you become friends and and and then we
19:23 also like talked hey what about you and
19:25 then actually i realized many people
19:27 would say okay this is these are great
19:28 speakers actually very often they talk
19:30 about things they're just
19:32 learning and doing the talk and
19:34 delivering talk is part of the learning
19:36 phase so it's not like you're an expert
19:39 and then you are eligible to talk you
19:41 have
19:42 and i think more value and this is also
19:44 what i'm trying to point out no matter
19:46 where i am if it's in the community or
19:48 customers don't talk about the shiny
19:52 things they're nice yeah you talk about
19:54 them but don't forget to talk about the
19:56 mistakes you made and how you solved
19:58 them and what would the problems were
20:00 and where you were stuck because this is
20:02 where we can learn from each other we
20:04 don't need
20:05 we hardly learn from impressing each
20:07 other with like cool stuff so
20:10 this is uh yeah so
20:13 so a talk proposal could be something
20:15 that you don't know yet but you want to
20:18 learn then you come up with the top
20:19 proposal and then uh by the time the
20:21 conference happens like you have to
20:23 actually learn this thing to talk to
20:25 yeah it's not bad it's not that short
20:26 notice so of course you probably so for
20:29 some when i did the pandas talks i was
20:31 already working a lot with pandas but i
20:33 did i did deep dives by providing bandus
20:37 talks and also like thinking about okay
20:39 what what should we basically point to
20:42 is pandas at that time because all the
20:44 pandas tutorials were like
20:46 not nobody was explaining the index at
20:48 that time and i think if you don't if
20:50 you understand the index and nobody
20:51 understands index except maybe
20:56 yeah
20:57 it's an important topic to say hey
20:59 there's the index it's a very important
21:00 structure when you work with the data
21:02 and actually you can do like really cool
21:03 things with that as well which can which
21:05 are really useful in big time savers
21:07 that was then uh then
21:10 i i did the talk series about deep
21:12 learning and ai which was deep learning
21:14 for fun and profit taking blog posts and
21:16 trying to do like style transfer text
21:18 generation
21:19 speech generation uh and and
21:23 and things um and that was it was quite
21:26 fun actually
21:27 i missed that a bit because i learned a
21:29 lot about deep learning i learned a lot
21:31 about how to approach it and of course
21:34 being part of the consultancy i also
21:37 have to consider oh there might be also
21:38 like customers there so it's
21:41 it can be toy full but of course it's
21:44 what's what's also like the connection
21:46 what can you learn as a business from
21:48 that and the learning from
21:50 the deep learning for fun and profit
21:51 series is basically yeah you don't
21:53 predict deep learning you have to you
21:55 have to experiment you have to be free
21:57 to experiment and you you cannot
22:00 basically decide what's if something is
22:02 going to fly or not which was it was
22:04 quite useful
22:06 and yeah yeah stuff like that
22:08 and the range of topics so it was the
22:10 they think you mentioned was it what was
22:12 the for fun and profit was deep learning
22:15 with learning foreign yeah yeah so it
22:18 was quite enjoyable um and that was fun
22:21 of course it was many weekends spent on
22:22 making
22:23 these things happen
22:27 because for me i mean like many people
22:29 think a partner at the consultancy is
22:32 just like oh yeah you're just like
22:33 manager and i said no yeah yeah of
22:34 course i'm also a manager but i'm a
22:36 generalist because also if i'm work with
22:38 clients for me it's very important to
22:41 understand the tech
22:43 we're talk discussing we're working on
22:46 so i'm still hands-on so i'm not just
22:48 like on this level x please xdo team
22:50 explain me this new technology so no i
22:53 i'm probably not
22:55 i'm not the expert on everything but i
22:58 i've always worked with everything and i
23:00 can give like a a very good um and
23:03 insights what's useful what's not useful
23:06 so and yeah that was the deep learning
23:08 part and i had the ideas arcaders there
23:11 are so many misunderstandings in the
23:13 hype about data and ai and why they not
23:16 work at
23:17 companies or small bit small or bigger
23:19 companies and yeah but for example you
23:22 recycle i will talk about software
23:23 engineering because i see there's
23:26 still too many data scientists around
23:28 who have not heard about it and your
23:30 sci-fi is an academic conference and
23:32 students work with jupiter notebooks and
23:34 if we really want to deliver something
23:38 reproducible and stable um i thought
23:41 about no it's time to give a talk what
23:44 you really should
23:45 know about software engineering yeah
23:48 yeah so the your talks are quite diverse
23:50 so then you also have a talk about
23:52 pandas you mentioned that mongodb and
23:54 one of the talks
23:56 or variation of talk i noticed quite of
23:58 quite a few talks you had so the topic
24:02 is explaining ai to managers and this is
24:04 actually like the topic of today's uh
24:07 interview
24:08 so like i guess you as a manager as a
24:11 managing partner
24:13 you need to do this quite a lot
24:14 especially like you talk to your clients
24:16 right and then you probably talk to
24:19 people who do not necessarily have a lot
24:21 of knowledge about machine learning
24:22 right so then you have to explain all
24:24 these things this is how this
24:26 theme appeared right this is how you
24:28 started talking about this right yeah
24:31 and actually like talk giving talks was
24:33 really helpful
24:34 to explain things
24:36 to other humans
24:38 because actually i was when i started
24:40 doing the talk doing talks
24:42 i was really bad at explaining because i
24:44 was too detailed i was
24:46 nested sentences and everything very
24:48 often people said now alex i cannot
24:50 follow you ah and then i said and the
24:52 talks also helped me to evolve
24:55 personally to
24:57 simplify sometimes because of course i
25:00 if you work on software and you want to
25:03 want to deliver quality away so you have
25:04 like an engineer's mindset and the
25:06 downside is
25:08 you want to be very exact but sometimes
25:10 simplification is not exactly exact
25:12 enough so sometimes but have to simplify
25:15 things um
25:16 to get the message across um
25:19 so yeah um of course this helped me a
25:22 lot because the clients we work with
25:24 they they are looking for
25:25 state-of-the-art tech they are they work
25:28 with open source um
25:31 they but very often we also have to
25:33 explain
25:34 uh
25:36 proper territory software you buy is
25:38 probably a solution it depends on
25:41 what you want to use it for but
25:44 data nai something you you have to build
25:47 you cannot just buy it it's not like a
25:49 piece of software and
25:51 very often we also support people in the
25:53 company um to convince decision makers
25:56 because
25:57 very many many people management they
25:59 think of data and ai yeah that's just
26:01 like a piece of software you buy and you
26:03 hire people to implement but it's not a
26:05 data and ai uh it's two things like
26:08 getting your data in order you actually
26:10 can use it and and if a company is older
26:12 than five years old the data is always
26:14 like messy and distributed and
26:18 you have to really work on on on
26:20 how you organize your data how you make
26:23 it accessible or if you were like yeah
26:26 find new approaches for like more like
26:28 ai centric
26:30 data um
26:31 and on the other hand
26:33 of course there is sometimes a software
26:35 tool which can help or help for a part
26:37 and it's probably easier because not
26:40 everybody has like tons of skilled
26:42 developers
26:44 that's the other thing um
26:46 and so our part is very often to help
26:49 make
26:50 the right calls and then if it's
26:52 implementation well in open source um we
26:55 we're we are there to make it happen
26:58 so we're not dogmatic about open source
27:00 but i'm i'm a strong believer is
27:02 everything in analytics
27:04 prediction
27:06 data is basically why not use open
27:09 source it's way easier because if you
27:11 buy software tools you also have to
27:12 learn it and and what i like to see
27:16 many decision makers they don't want to
27:18 be dependent on a piece of software from
27:21 the supplier which is probably a startup
27:23 they don't know
27:24 is it going to last
27:26 or even like bigger bigger software
27:27 vendors they
27:29 they
27:30 they invent new products and
27:32 two years later they're gone so and we
27:34 think yeah okay just enable yourself use
27:37 open source um
27:38 build build up a team
27:40 build up your team skills start working
27:42 with the community contribute to
27:43 community and then you basically give
27:45 all the freedom you want of course it's
27:48 work but if you miss a piece if you miss
27:51 a feature you can just like go ahead and
27:53 implement it
27:54 that's the beauty of open source right
27:56 yeah and
27:57 so this topic of explaining machine
28:00 learning to managers
28:02 for you as a consultant like why is it
28:04 important can you not just tell your
28:06 clients that trust me it works
28:10 so like it's a bunch of math you will
28:11 not understand it anyway so why should i
28:13 bother explain it trust me it works yeah
28:16 people have to make
28:18 people have to make decisions of course
28:20 i mean we're talking about like building
28:22 software in the larger team of takes it
28:25 takes budget and of course other people
28:27 need to know
28:28 why should i spend the budget is it the
28:30 right call and of course as we always
28:32 say nobody was ever fired for buying
28:34 something from microsoft yeah
28:37 so this is the other thing like of
28:38 course if you hate is the ibm solution
28:40 and people say okay let's buy this
28:43 and because yeah it's it's very very
28:45 cool but very often we still have to
28:47 explain it's not software we build of
28:49 course we build software to
28:52 work with data to build models but this
28:55 is
28:56 it's it's not a software project and
28:58 many people are not fully aware of that
29:00 yet it gets better and better and so i
29:03 would say like five years ago as many
29:05 c-level
29:06 people uh were not aware that um
29:10 basically open source or data scientist
29:12 is something different than peop
29:13 somebody who sets up your email which is
29:16 just like configuration we are a
29:18 dashboard because it's all i t and so i
29:20 don't
29:21 i don't understand they don't understand
29:23 of course it's also like nice to see
29:25 this generation changes are happening so
29:27 more and more
29:29 decision makers younger decision makers
29:32 enter the field they know many of them
29:34 know python because from
29:37 studying writing their phd thesis stuff
29:40 like that so yeah it's getting better
29:43 and better
29:44 but still we need to support them also
29:46 what which
29:47 opens those tools they should use
29:49 because there's always like there's a
29:51 new framework every day uh yeah and
29:54 what's the best choice yeah yeah i mean
29:56 it's cool uh but on the other hand it's
29:59 always we have to see okay
30:02 how how long it's gonna last because of
30:05 course we ever we
30:07 we lack resources everybody likes
30:09 resources so we have to help them to
30:11 make the right calls and go for
30:13 something stable which can work for
30:15 multiple years um so and this is also
30:18 very helpful like being around the
30:20 conferences and interacting with the
30:22 community so i can have like a broad
30:24 field of tools which around there can
30:26 get like good good
30:28 um
30:30 yeah yeah like good advice on which is
30:33 good
30:33 which is probably
30:36 even better but with a smaller community
30:39 and so probably it's better to use the
30:40 other two
30:42 so if i understood you correctly the
30:44 main
30:45 thing you want to solve with explaining
30:47 ai to managers is not to explain how
30:50 actually like i don't know the last
30:52 transformer models work right what you
30:54 want to explain is that
30:57 in addition to this
30:58 model that does this magical thing there
31:01 are many many things around this that
31:03 you also need to think about right like
31:05 all these things you mentioned like it's
31:06 not just
31:07 data and ai in one box there is data
31:10 which is like a vast thing and then
31:12 there is ai component
31:14 like which sits in the center maybe
31:16 right that's what we need to explain
31:17 right actually what i need to explain if
31:20 you
31:21 if you're serious for the first question
31:23 you have to ask is
31:25 is this really just the strategy of the
31:27 organization or is it something oh yeah
31:28 we should try this i've read it in the
31:31 newspaper or seen something on linkedin
31:33 um and i think the times oh we should
31:35 try this and maybe i think these times
31:37 are definitely over now even if it's
31:39 your strategy or it's not and if it's
31:42 not
31:42 good luck
31:45 so other other companies will be
31:47 eventually faster and better so if it's
31:50 a strategy um people of course they
31:53 people are fascinated by ai they want to
31:56 know about neural networks artificial
31:58 intelligence and of course there's a lot
31:59 of science fiction ideas hypes in their
32:02 head and
32:03 very often uh
32:05 i'm just going to okay um
32:08 explain to them okay you actually don't
32:10 have to worry about building a neural
32:12 network at all it's something you can
32:15 just like get from the shelf there's so
32:17 much research on your networks so
32:20 maybe you have to make a choice but you
32:22 never have to design your own neural
32:24 network very few companies need to do
32:26 that because but then they're like super
32:28 specialized ai companies
32:30 um
32:31 so basically hey
32:33 the magic is already out there you just
32:35 have to scout it we can help you making
32:37 the right calls the challenge is
32:40 establishing the right company culture
32:43 like because
32:45 i always say get your data right to
32:47 scale experiments because you can never
32:50 know where the real value
32:53 will be for the company many things are
32:56 good ideas but i also have to explain
32:58 yes
32:59 for example google google does a lot of
33:01 research with ml and deep learning and
33:05 then there's also the things that work
33:07 in research some of them go to
33:10 production and even then only five
33:12 percent said only five percent survive
33:14 there
33:15 so things which might sound plausible
33:18 will probably not be the solution and
33:20 things which
33:22 you don't think about at all might be
33:26 great solutions and you have to
33:27 establish like an openness so you need
33:29 to establish
33:31 culture to get the data to collaboration
33:34 to openly discuss problems because of
33:36 course it's hard you do something fancy
33:38 a little machine learning and who wants
33:40 to do a presentation yes sorry it didn't
33:41 work out but we very often have this we
33:44 very often have this in
33:46 in in projects we say okay we're looking
33:49 for a solution for example uh a client
33:51 of ours was looking for a solution in
33:54 natural language processing and they had
33:56 like 30 years of
33:58 research data and documents there and
34:01 they said okay yeah
34:03 search keyword search is not good enough
34:05 so what about building a knowledge graph
34:07 i said yeah well of course let's do this
34:09 and then we
34:10 started building the knowledge graph and
34:12 but then we had to say ah sorry
34:15 it's like 30 years of research but it's
34:16 still not good enough the knowledge
34:18 graph is not building up so of course
34:21 you can get data from outside in but we
34:23 want to be one
34:25 that
34:26 we i always have to
34:28 look for what is the real problem we
34:31 want to solve what do you really want to
34:32 accomplish and here he was okay we need
34:34 more insights into we need we need
34:37 better access to this corpus and so
34:39 knowledge graph was not the solution so
34:41 we say okay we don't say
34:43 we don't tune things and do a knowledge
34:45 graph and have a nice presentation and
34:47 said yeah bye bye good luck with the
34:48 nostrils unless we address this we don't
34:50 we do not believe this will ever fly in
34:53 to something useful
34:55 and then we say okay but we have
34:57 alternatives so here alternative was
34:59 keyword
35:00 extractions finding entities
35:03 summaries and actually then clustering
35:05 and then they were like and then put
35:07 this into a nice ui and then they really
35:09 had a very good could get a totally
35:12 different perspective on all their
35:14 research documents to find out okay what
35:16 was the battery research at the time
35:18 because of course for them it's not just
35:20 we would like to look at this for
35:23 because we like to dig in our history um
35:26 we're talking about research department
35:27 these research departments have like
35:30 billion figures
35:32 to work with so on of course if they
35:34 know
35:34 we researched this 20 years ago and it
35:37 didn't work or we know it didn't work
35:40 why it didn't work
35:42 it can help to save a lot of money and
35:45 resources uh if
35:47 unless you reinvent the wheel and
35:48 probably come to the same conclusion
35:50 yeah so it's um yeah
35:52 and of course
35:54 this it's very open to be also like
35:56 if there are problems to be really open
35:58 and transparent with the clients and not
36:00 just trying to to uh
36:04 work on the happy path
36:06 of course
36:08 i'm happy to say we always ended up in
36:10 the happy path so we never had like a
36:12 total failure we always like found a
36:15 good solution addressing the problem but
36:18 in between it's quite a right and you
36:20 have to explain things because people
36:22 also as very often experts involved and
36:25 uh when we did that project that was
36:28 still a thing
36:29 and of course you said oh can't we use
36:31 beard yeah we like to use bird but we
36:33 don't really think it will help solving
36:35 the problem we're currently addressing
36:36 um so and and yeah we're not paid to
36:39 play with the new newest tech we are
36:41 paid to do yeah to develop value and
36:44 help people to save time to be more
36:47 effective to make better decisions
36:50 would you say your biggest challenge in
36:52 explaining ai to managers is
36:56 conveying the experimentational nature
36:58 of all these projects saying that okay
37:01 like yes there is this cool tech that
37:03 you heard about from social net social
37:06 media right but it might not be the
37:08 solution for your program so we need to
37:10 experiment we need to play
37:12 with different tools and we need to have
37:14 a proper
37:16 way of humiliating
37:18 if something is working or not right
37:20 um actually i like the main challenge or
37:22 not
37:24 actually i'm
37:26 i used to be a little bit more like
37:29 uh
37:30 like uh i kind of say like holding back
37:33 in the past but actually i learned to be
37:34 very being really upfront
37:36 is the best thing just to say for
37:38 example uh yes
37:41 we had a meeting in a client and
37:42 somebody just told me okay these are
37:44 like this is the input and was input
37:46 from frankfurter algominer about there's
37:49 some ai
37:52 camp somewhere and it was and i read the
37:55 article and was full of
37:57 nice idealistic ideas and and there's
38:00 like stuff people read about yes ai
38:03 finished beethoven's unfriendly sympathy
38:06 and and and then i said and they said
38:08 are you really excited about it and said
38:10 what is my answer to that i said
38:12 i'm very sorry but we have to accept
38:16 the tenth symphony of beethoven will
38:18 never be finished because it has a very
38:20 simple reason
38:21 beethoven is dead and he never finished
38:23 it and
38:24 i think beethoven is a very
38:27 very good example because if you just go
38:30 one symphony back and said what if the
38:32 ninth symphony was unfinished we only
38:35 had like eight
38:36 of course an unfinished symphony could
38:38 be something that sounds like these
38:40 symphonies he has composed before but
38:43 especially if you look at the ninth
38:45 symphony of beethoven both the choir
38:47 which is the european hymn and
38:49 everything this is invention and ai at
38:52 the current stage doesn't really invent
38:55 things like that it can very good
38:57 repeat things it has learned of course
39:00 this is also
39:01 um so this is a very good example
39:03 explaining it with beethoven because
39:05 everybody gets excited i think oh this
39:07 is such a great thing i said no no we
39:09 will just like get the same thing we
39:11 know already and this is the strong suit
39:13 but
39:14 it's
39:15 i don't think it's a good solution and
39:16 also i think it's a little bit
39:18 disrespectful
39:20 yeah so because beethoven cannot say has
39:24 no longer
39:25 the ability to say no this is not what i
39:28 intended so but like stuff like really
39:30 really upfront but of course it's very
39:33 important to be respectful about it and
39:35 of course there's many hypes there's a
39:37 lot of startups around who claim things
39:39 and there was one and that's also like
39:41 really good being connected to community
39:43 because one ceo of the
39:45 one of of a startup was also like cited
39:48 in in the newspaper and then uh uh and i
39:51 said yeah yeah we're already there and
39:52 basically how we acted was over here
39:54 we're basically on the same level as the
39:55 point they cited us in this and then we
39:57 we're already there yet and and i said
40:00 yeah well
40:01 actually the person who wrote the
40:03 research paper gave gave a talk at a
40:04 whole meet up and actually the expert
40:06 working on on the topic gave us
40:09 a little different impression when
40:12 delivering the talk about the majority
40:15 of of the tech although the tech is
40:18 still exciting but of course this is
40:19 it's very good
40:21 you can also i can also give good
40:23 examples
40:24 why it's not just hype and why i'm not
40:26 just saying oh don't believe the hype
40:28 yeah it's it's i can
40:30 bring also evidence yeah and and and to
40:33 narrow it down and say hey what are you
40:34 really want to solve and i think the
40:37 biggest issues are still
40:40 company culture like have expert domain
40:43 expert and technical people and
40:46 engineers
40:47 work together on the same level as one
40:50 team because bigger enterprises it still
40:53 there's the departments
40:55 they they have a requirement they write
40:57 a ticket or use a story and then they
40:59 just throw it over and so and
41:02 and our message is no no work in hybrid
41:04 teams work on this together because we
41:06 don't have time for paperwork and all
41:08 this miscommunication in between but of
41:10 course
41:12 people humans are not really good at
41:14 changing routines we are we are routine
41:17 animals and so i think the biggest
41:19 challenge even the bigger challenge than
41:21 solving ai is actually changing
41:23 human routines and i think for me it's
41:25 also like
41:27 one thing that absolutely belongs
41:29 together you won't be able to invent
41:32 technology if you are not able to
41:36 reinvent your company culture or if you
41:39 already have phone because like for some
41:41 time many startups they start they have
41:43 this form that's basically built in from
41:44 the history
41:46 the young but especially
41:48 big larger enterprises they go back
41:50 decades and of course there's
41:53 it's like
41:54 multiple generations of people working
41:56 there and of course it takes time
42:00 and in preparation for this uh interview
42:03 so you also like i asked you hey can you
42:05 think about some questions that i should
42:07 ask you and then you can came up with a
42:09 few so we already talked so you added a
42:12 few points so
42:13 i'll just read these points right first
42:15 one innovation requires culture and then
42:17 the second innovation requires patience
42:19 so i think we covered the culture part
42:21 right so we talked like we should be
42:24 extreme it should be experimentational
42:26 data driven you shouldn't be like
42:28 uh you know just chase the latest uh
42:32 trends from twitter or whatever
42:34 but the other thing this one innovation
42:37 requires patience so what do you mean
42:39 here like why do we need patience
42:42 like
42:44 will ai not just magically solve our
42:46 problems like tomorrow no
42:48 no because i think the patience is very
42:50 good to make good calls uh i give you
42:52 another example so if you uh
42:55 it's probably without slides a little
42:57 bit hard to explain so i i i
43:00 it's i i gave
43:01 i gave a more extensive talk about this
43:03 at pi data london and it's on youtube
43:05 already has the same title as
43:08 our today's session
43:09 and um so basically why patients it was
43:12 actually quite interesting because
43:14 before i actually this talk i was
43:16 complaining like oh i hardly have
43:18 questions from the audience probably i
43:20 answered them already up front i was
43:22 actually
43:23 making fun with alexandre saucedo about
43:25 this because hey after you have the same
43:27 experience so and then basically this
43:29 was one of like where we really started
43:31 the conversation after the talk because
43:33 i was pointing out hey i love i like
43:35 agile i like retrospectives but and of
43:39 course there's like a lot of like scrum
43:40 rituals but what happens
43:43 if you have for example you have like
43:45 every three weeks you do a retrospective
43:47 and i
43:48 like just like us
43:50 we could ask ourselves
43:52 or like think
43:53 what happens if you ask engineers and
43:55 developer for problems will they ever
43:57 say there is no problem at all i don't
43:59 know ask for problems and you will
44:01 always get at least five problems
44:03 because we're problem solvers and of
44:05 course we always have problems at hand
44:08 and and if you do retrospectives for
44:10 example are you everything might be in
44:13 order um but if you ask okay what can we
44:16 improve there will always be tons of
44:18 ideas to improve but
44:20 why not say everything's in order we
44:22 have accomplished just that the spree
44:24 goals were accomplished we're on track
44:26 everybody's helping we have found a good
44:28 working rhythm and say okay this is the
44:29 retro let's finish after 15 minutes go
44:32 for coffee or pick up work because
44:34 everybody's always busy
44:36 um of course we try to find more
44:38 problems and try to over engineer the
44:42 whole thing as well because what i
44:44 learned also like working with
44:45 non-technical people non over
44:47 engineering is actually not an
44:49 engineer's only problem many people
44:52 do that even in management um they try
44:55 to over engineer they and then and and
44:58 ask too often is there something we
45:00 should improve is there something we
45:01 should improve and i said no no patience
45:03 you just need to
45:05 get more like a bird's-eye view because
45:07 things take time and
45:10 and
45:11 it was quite interesting because like
45:12 especially the retros and agile for data
45:15 and data science it quite resonated with
45:18 the audience it was a great conversation
45:20 afterwards
45:22 so
45:23 so interesting i'm just taking trying to
45:26 somehow distill the main message here
45:29 uh
45:30 so
45:31 like
45:32 we as humans always want to
45:35 look for ways to improve what we
45:37 currently have let's say we have a
45:38 product and it's doing i don't know
45:40 let's say we have search right and
45:41 search is working fine and we as a
45:44 humans if somebody comes to me and says
45:46 hey what do you want to improve i can
45:47 say
45:48 like our search could be better right
45:50 and then it triggers the whole
45:52 discussion of how we can make it better
45:55 even though maybe we don't need really
45:57 to work on improving search right now
45:59 maybe there's something else to work on
46:01 right yeah right or like like the
46:03 firmware also like maybe just
46:06 lean back and watch what happens
46:08 until because if something has happened
46:10 i know we already know okay we should
46:12 improve this we should improve this and
46:13 maybe just like take a step back work on
46:15 something else and come back two three
46:18 weeks later and see okay is the whole
46:20 thing really now
46:21 not working anymore or is everything
46:23 just like fine because of course if you
46:25 if you're working
46:27 if you're very involved in not working
46:28 on something of course you see all the
46:30 tiny bits that could be better but are
46:32 the tiny bits actually
46:35 important for solving what what you're
46:37 working on and sometimes and i also fear
46:40 like working on too many details um
46:44 might might also not be good because you
46:46 lea you you lose the bigger perspective
46:48 maybe there are other factors especially
46:51 if you work in data and ai maybe you
46:52 have solved the problem and you know
46:54 knew how to even tune the algorithms
46:58 even better but maybe taking a step back
47:00 could also be helpful okay now the
47:02 algorithm um what about like ethics and
47:05 all the stuff so like lean back what
47:07 does this really work is there anything
47:09 in the data and take also like some
47:11 different perspectives on working
47:14 on the on the projects and not just like
47:16 over engineering the the technical parts
47:18 and then in germany we have a saying at
47:20 the scooter that the perfect zone is
47:21 defined as gluten
47:24 so actually perfectionism is the the
47:26 enemy of the good
47:28 and then there's another thing i picked
47:29 up from
47:30 our
47:31 software architecture book is actually
47:33 it's
47:35 no
47:36 big system will ever be perfect
47:39 yeah so that's that i mean that's like
47:42 the nature of having like complex and
47:44 bigger systems they will never be
47:45 perfect
47:46 they cannot they can never be perfect so
47:49 we actually have to deal and work with
47:51 okay this is just like probably good
47:53 enough yeah
47:55 and that's still good engineering
47:57 because as an engineer i think no it's
47:59 not perfect so
48:00 yeah
48:02 i think a quote from
48:04 was it from or somebody else like from
48:07 some famous engineers was that uh
48:10 premature optimization is the
48:12 root of all evil something like this
48:14 yeah yeah yeah yeah
48:15 and this is also something this is also
48:18 something uh
48:19 i also have to point out very often
48:22 we don't optimize for performance until
48:25 we had a bottleneck because
48:28 i just know from experience when you try
48:30 to optimize upfront you will always
48:32 optimize the wrong things
48:34 anyway so
48:36 uh so it's um it's uh
48:39 that's
48:40 a huge part of like communicating being
48:42 part of teams making data and i hop and
48:45 also to say hey
48:46 stop here like wait we should do
48:48 something else and refocus and
48:51 give advice on that
48:53 and speaking of that so there is a
48:55 question that we have so the question is
48:57 sometimes we don't need machine learning
48:59 or artificial intelligence how do we
49:01 convince managers or business
49:03 stakeholders to not use ml or ai when
49:06 there are others who insist to use them
49:10 it's
49:10 actually
49:12 very simple
49:14 so usually
49:17 when i talk about it i say okay
49:20 we we we suggest like a reference
49:22 architecture to our clients so if you're
49:24 serious about data you need like a
49:25 reference architecture which is
49:27 basically data in data like structured
49:29 data lake just being a concept not not
49:32 not a real storage thing and
49:34 making data accessible
49:36 and accessible
49:38 in
49:39 a very consumer friendly way and of
49:41 course with all the governance stuff
49:43 being taken care of as well and even
49:46 like in first meetings when people
49:48 contact us about data and i i very often
49:51 say already okay and if we have
49:53 established this reference architecture
49:55 very basically okay you can get the data
49:57 it's really easy it's way easier to get
49:59 the data you don't have to
50:00 research where is the data and and pull
50:03 these together because
50:04 we're taking data projects they often
50:07 start from the wrong end oh we have this
50:10 idea where can we find the data yeah you
50:12 can like
50:13 do like
50:14 hundreds of these problems but you will
50:16 just you will just build a hundred zeros
50:18 while doing it so actually if you're
50:20 serious you say get the data right do
50:22 the experiments qualify and
50:24 or not and
50:26 of course i also say seventy percent
50:29 once with the data is right and very
50:31 accessible seventy percent of the data
50:33 use will likely be just
50:35 um business intelligence and just like
50:38 analytics no machine learning at all
50:40 because
50:42 like having the data accessible building
50:44 or dashboards for business users is is
50:47 the problem solved and then maybe
50:50 another 20 will be machine learning and
50:52 if you're lucky there's also like 10
50:54 percent deep learning depending of
50:56 course the domain that they and and of
50:59 course depending on the data mix because
51:01 but most companies still have numerical
51:03 data of course if they were like more
51:05 unstructured data in the mix or images
51:08 deep learning um it would of course be a
51:11 bigger percentage but
51:13 i not i'm not there just like to say oh
51:15 we only do data and i okay if we
51:16 organize if you get your data right you
51:19 can have better standard analytics
51:22 that's that's also a good thing yeah
51:23 that's all
51:24 and and it's it's also like business
51:26 intelligence this is not our remedy we
51:29 are here to save
51:31 i see our goal is to save people time to
51:35 help them to make better decisions
51:37 faster without like
51:39 yeah handling excel sheets and whatever
51:42 all day so
51:45 and i also see like speaking of patients
51:48 so i imagine this scenario where
51:50 somebody comes hey we want to use
51:53 um
51:54 this latest ai trends and then but how
51:56 about your data pipelines do you have
51:58 like a lake and then you build a lake
52:00 and then but can we use data data
52:02 science now can we use artificial
52:04 intelligence now no no no wait like
52:06 there are cases where we can solve like
52:08 with analytics right i always say the
52:10 lake the lake hasn't been has doesn't
52:13 have to be full like if it's like 10
52:15 already or if there's some data in there
52:17 you can already start it it's more like
52:19 the about like
52:21 the right mindset like
52:23 okay get the data right and not look for
52:25 nice
52:26 machine learning or deep learning ideas
52:28 and then like research later because
52:29 then we will likely have some export of
52:31 them from the database and you basically
52:33 have just like you're just like being
52:35 disconnected from the system because of
52:37 because of course if you really want to
52:40 build efficiency you have to bring it to
52:42 production and then of course
52:44 the solution for this is ml ops so like
52:47 hey there's new data retrain the models
52:49 like
52:50 close the circle because there's also
52:52 like a lot of like machine
52:54 learning um or data scientists
52:56 national engineers or data scientists
52:58 they also spend a lot of time like
53:00 release building models releasing them
53:02 putting them somewhere and
53:04 so uh
53:06 ml ops is actually
53:08 currently the best thing you can do to
53:11 become effective um and and and get
53:14 things done and
53:16 have uh that people think about the
53:19 problems and not just like
53:21 um
53:22 wasting time on doing
53:24 like stuff you can automate
53:27 so would you say that a melopsi is the
53:28 best recipe for
53:30 machine learning in all these
53:31 enterprises or with something else
53:34 yeah definitely
53:35 because it's it's it's
53:37 it's not just because it's ml ops
53:39 because ml ops is
53:41 it also
53:43 that's that's probably another thing i i
53:45 always preach
53:47 it's not just programming
53:48 everything we do is also like a standard
53:50 decision
53:51 we don't have to standardize things we
53:53 have to
53:55 build common we have to set you have to
53:57 settle a whole company let's work on
53:59 this standard this is how we do things
54:00 because of course if you just like it as
54:02 a company and you have like
54:04 20 data scientists and
54:06 and you don't
54:08 see okay what's the common standard how
54:10 do you want to
54:12 build ci cd pipelines and all this if
54:14 you have 20 people you probably have 30
54:16 different approaches running ci cd
54:17 pipelines in the company and then
54:19 cleaning it up is basically impossible
54:21 you can you can you can really so of
54:23 course this is also not another patient
54:25 part don't
54:26 don't think about okay how can we
54:29 deliver things in quality and increase
54:31 the quality rather than thinking about
54:33 making many many many different approach
54:36 approaches happen or not um
54:38 so it's it's it's very very important to
54:42 to standardize to think what's a good
54:44 standard also like to question standards
54:46 during the process until
54:48 it's basically um at the best level um
54:52 and
54:53 yeah so
54:55 this is so
54:56 to be honest like emma lops feels uh
54:59 lately because of all the buzzwords all
55:01 the buzz around this world it feels like
55:03 a buzzword right so people would throw
55:06 uh
55:07 envelopes everywhere like how do we
55:09 solve it oh with emma lopes what do we
55:11 do here let's do envelopes and then i
55:13 already import
55:14 imagine like important people from
55:16 mckinsey all these suits
55:18 um
55:20 delivering the presentation in
55:22 powerpoint and then they have envelopes
55:24 like with big letters there saying that
55:26 it will solve all your problems okay do
55:28 you also have this feeling that
55:31 people just talk about mlops without
55:32 release you know knowing what it is i
55:35 mean like we've experienced it like
55:37 there was the big data hype everybody
55:39 here we do big big data so why is your
55:42 data not in order when we want to start
55:43 deep learning projects now so of course
55:46 there's always big hype and of course
55:48 we also have to be really critical uh
55:51 people push for good news we consume
55:54 stuff on social media linkedin and it's
55:57 hardly questioned we always if you go on
56:00 linkedin i try not to be too much on
56:01 linkedin because you always get the
56:02 impression everybody has solved
56:04 everything and we basically last then
56:06 then you go to clients and you say okay
56:08 basically i've made a travel in the past
56:11 or like for 10 years because this
56:13 everything is i have to i i have to make
56:17 some efforts to explain things
56:19 bring in new concepts get new ideas and
56:21 so it's it's it's like always like a hot
56:24 and cold path but of course there's many
56:25 people who talk about
56:27 ops and actually have no clue and
56:28 sometimes if you look at larger consult
56:32 i like like like like
56:34 like really big ones i have met many
56:36 people or i find my clients and look but
56:38 they delivered i always see like okay
56:40 yeah you basically have no idea you
56:42 basically just copy paste and do
56:44 something and uh it's it's you don't
56:47 have an understanding so when we discuss
56:50 ml ops i i don't put big letters there i
56:53 just put there was this great paper on
56:55 ml ops from the
56:56 kit with the whole detail process and
56:59 then we just go there okay
57:01 where where are you now what can you
57:03 already do for example like data
57:05 exploration i mean everybody can do that
57:07 at least if you think about considered
57:09 envelopes just to do you already
57:11 probably have like a part of a restart
57:13 line and then you can see okay
57:15 what do you already have to solve what
57:17 with p which pieces of the puzzle are
57:19 already in place what do we have to work
57:21 on and of course having like this very
57:23 detailed
57:26 process we can all say okay
57:29 sometimes if we work in finance if we do
57:31 a lot of finance or insurance and of
57:33 course there are like also regulatory
57:35 measures so uh and they say okay do
57:38 regulatory measurements or
57:41 also fit in and of course if you have
57:43 like this nice detailed process to see
57:45 okay before we release a new model
57:47 probably somebody from the department
57:48 has to sign off not because we don't
57:50 trust the tech but it's part of the
57:52 regulatory process and then you can just
57:54 like say okay this makes a whole picture
57:56 and we already discussed like okay how
57:58 can we solve it what is there what is
58:00 not because
58:01 hype or not nothing is a self a thing
58:04 for like a purpose in itself so of
58:07 course we end the ops and i i love
58:09 envelopes
58:10 because it's just like saving a lot of
58:13 time and helping to build better things
58:15 and yeah so i think it's the the right
58:18 way to go although it's
58:21 a lot of work from
58:22 the most most companies
58:25 the emelops uh
58:27 would you say it's more about processes
58:28 right about the process you have that
58:30 you have to follow rather than
58:32 tools because
58:33 my impression from all these companies
58:36 that offer envelope solutions that they
58:39 generate a lot of
58:41 you know let's say okay we are the
58:43 envelope solution right
58:45 while it's not just about tools but
58:47 rather how you structure your process
58:50 right
58:51 the the the problem is also like they
58:54 always want to okay you need to use the
58:56 platform you need to put the data there
58:58 and there are many companies and now we
58:59 can't
59:01 we don't trust
59:03 a startup
59:04 because of course you maybe have a
59:05 funding and maybe you're gone next year
59:08 and then you have the data and of course
59:10 also like day they plan
59:13 mid and long term so we're not looking
59:15 for okay we need a solution which works
59:18 short term of course everybody's happy
59:20 if there's a quick quick solution for
59:22 everything but they they uh we need to
59:24 be able to run long term because if you
59:27 have like millions of customers you
59:28 cannot say oh sorry
59:30 wrong startup we can no longer deliver
59:33 this or this is stuck or we have to do
59:35 it manually now
59:36 um
59:37 so of course there are many things to
59:39 consider and
59:41 and and of course
59:42 many of these platforms are also limited
59:44 because as i mentioned in the in the
59:46 beginning freedom
59:48 is very important to most clients to say
59:51 okay we need this feature we want to
59:52 implement it and
59:54 like bagging supplier like the suppliers
59:58 for for the software windows for that
1:00:00 and waiting for um uh responses um this
1:00:04 is
1:00:04 no way for us because everybody has the
1:00:06 experience
1:00:08 yeah you file tickets you never get an
1:00:10 answer even if it's something urgent so
1:00:12 yeah and yeah and this is basically a
1:00:15 thing and of course
1:00:17 what i'm also mentioning so because i
1:00:19 would suggest ml ops only to companies
1:00:21 if you have like
1:00:23 um a decent team of
1:00:25 experts around the company i would not
1:00:27 suggest oh we want to move into data
1:00:29 science now we have hired three junior
1:00:32 data scientists but and we should do
1:00:33 everything probably from the very
1:00:35 beginning and do ml ops i would say this
1:00:36 is a very bad idea because and on office
1:00:39 comp is of course it's complicated it's
1:00:41 a lot of work to get everything right to
1:00:43 get like this automation level um
1:00:46 but you're so you need to have in-house
1:00:49 skills of course we can from current
1:00:50 speed always help building the skills
1:00:53 help building envelopes and and other
1:00:55 things are in data and ai but
1:00:58 it's it's not an easy problem of course
1:01:00 it just looks easy because it makes
1:01:01 sense but if you know
1:01:03 there's a lot of details to work out
1:01:07 so
1:01:08 if somebody has questions
1:01:10 who me and they want to ask you or maybe
1:01:12 they want to apply to that position by
1:01:14 data that you mentioned or maybe they
1:01:16 want to
1:01:17 ask for your advice maybe to help for
1:01:20 their company so how do they find you
1:01:23 you can find me on linkedin uh i'm the
1:01:25 only alexander and alexander handoff is
1:01:27 actually really easy to find you can
1:01:29 find me on linkedin also on twitter
1:01:31 although i very often miss
1:01:33 messages from from from twitter
1:01:36 so probably the best way is is just like
1:01:40 add me uh write me on linkedin um
1:01:43 or just if you're at the conference just
1:01:45 come by and say hello
1:01:47 and
1:01:48 any pi data conference right and he'll
1:01:50 be there no i think just european ones
1:01:54 wait
1:01:55 not true like actually
1:01:57 it's actually to actually i'm actually
1:02:00 pretty close to pi data miami but we are
1:02:02 on holiday and
1:02:04 so because that's on the 27th of
1:02:06 september and actually i'm i'm close by

1:02:10 actually we have other plans we actually
1:02:13 planned for disney world so i cannot say
1:02:16 go to pi data to miami um no uh yeah so
1:02:20 so yeah mostly the european ones um

1:03:00 for asking questions for listening
1:03:02 um thanks for organizing the podcast
1:03:05 yeah well in online it's uh not as
1:03:08 difficult as offline like i cannot
1:03:10 imagine what you need to go through to
1:03:12 actually organize things offline because
