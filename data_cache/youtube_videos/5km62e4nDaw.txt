0:00 Hi everyone, welcome to our event. This
0:02 event is brought to you by Redox Club
0:04 which is a community of people who love
0:06 data. We have weekly events. Uh well
0:09 during summer they are not so weekly but
0:12 still we have events. So if you want to
0:14 find out more about the events we have
0:16 we actually have quite a few in our
0:18 pipeline. Um there is a link in the
0:20 description. Uh click it click on it and
0:22 check it out. uh in particular today
0:26 later today we will have a workshop
0:29 about serverless deploying your machine
0:30 learning models with serverless and
0:32 tomorrow we have a precourse Q&A about
0:36 our machine learning uh engineering
0:38 course and actually that's one of the
0:40 things we will talk about today too with
0:42 pastor uh but um a few other things
0:45 before we started so don't don't forget
0:47 to subscribe to our YouTube channel this
0:49 way you'll stay up to date with all our
0:51 um content that we have And last but not
0:54 least, we have an amazing Slack
0:56 community where you can hang out with
0:58 other data enthusiasts. Uh during
1:00 today's interview, you can ask any
1:02 question you want. There is a pinned
1:04 link in the live chat. Click on that
1:06 link, ask your questions, and we will be
1:08 covering these questions during the
1:09 interview. And by the way, I think this
1:11 is Grammarly's um thing. I haven't used
1:16 Grammarly in a while. Ever since uh
1:18 Chbt, I started using Chbt for uh I
1:22 started paying for CHBT. I just canceled
1:23 my grammarly. So maybe I should make a
1:27 new uh slide. Anyways, um so I need to
1:31 stop sharing my screen.
1:34 Now I'm opening the questions we
1:36 prepared
1:38 and
1:42 yeah so let's start.
1:45 You ready?
1:46 >> Yeah. Yeah. Um uh this week we'll talk
1:50 about learning machine learning while
1:52 being a medical student and how
1:53 self-arning turned into career. We have
1:56 a very special guest today. Pastor
1:58 Pastor um is was and has been an active
2:03 like he was a student of one of
2:06 participant of our one of our courses.
2:08 He has been very active participant. He
2:10 is a very active member of our
2:12 community. So I'm very happy to have him
2:15 today in this interview. So Pastor is a
2:17 machine learning engineer and a mentor.
2:19 He loves focusing on practical hands-on
2:21 work and while he was studying medicine
2:22 at the university he took on a side
2:25 project that introduced him to machine
2:26 learning and um he started sharing
2:30 things publicly during machine learning
2:31 zoom camp and that helped him get
2:34 interviews and job offers. That's really
2:35 cool. I actually didn't know much. So
2:37 this I'm just reading the bio that we
2:40 have. I'm really curious to know more
2:42 about that. So welcome pastor to uh this
2:45 interview.
2:47 Hi everyone. Thanks Alex. I'm really
2:50 excited about this interview. So yeah.
2:52 >> Yeah, me too. And I saw that you uh have
2:56 been very active and you uh in our
2:59 courses we have a leaderboard and I
3:01 think you were top one right in one of
3:03 our courses.
3:04 >> Yeah. Yeah. I I actually participate in
3:07 in the machine learning engineer course
3:10 and I was the I I had the first play on
3:13 my cohort. So yeah, that that that was
3:15 pretty cool. Yeah.
3:16 >> Yeah. Cool. So uh before we start
3:19 talking about all that, let's start with
3:21 your background. Can you tell us about
3:23 your career journey so far?
3:25 >> Yeah. Yeah. So so um I just recently
3:29 graduated from med school. So I'm a
3:31 medical doctor. But throughout my
3:33 career, I was learning programming and
3:36 started working as a statistician. Then
3:40 I moved to data analyst. then data
3:43 science, data engineering. So I I pretty
3:45 much went through the full data pipeline
3:49 and with roles and and and and
3:54 just projects that I that I have with a
3:57 lot of people and
4:00 so so yeah, you know, and and I I I was
4:04 just loving to to to improve and to and
4:07 to learn a lot of stuff. So I went
4:10 through the whole data pipeline with
4:13 roles and projects.
4:16 >> But what motivated you because uh
4:19 healthcare
4:20 and data science they don't seem very
4:24 related. They seem quite far apart. Um
4:27 so how did you get into programming
4:29 while being while being a student at a
4:32 med school?
4:33 >> Yeah. So, so I actually so before I I
4:37 graduate from med school, I I I graduate
4:40 from from a social science. I I graduate
4:44 from I I I am a criminologist as well
4:48 and I took some statistic class there
4:51 and I was a a teacher assistant there.
4:55 So when I started to do medical studies,
4:59 I you know like I saw a lot of
5:02 opportunities on on just to freelance
5:05 with with statistics and data analysts.
5:09 And so like my motivation mainly was to
5:13 have a remote work that was able to pay
5:16 the bills throughout the whole my career
5:18 and it was flexible enough to let me
5:21 studies because there there are not a
5:23 lot of many different roles that you can
5:25 do online. And for me starting a journey
5:30 in data was a big opportunity to just
5:33 keep studying while also
5:36 working in in something and and it was
5:40 excited to actually the book and you
5:42 know start to investigate
5:45 like what the data tells you. So I think
5:48 that curious mindset was also a really
5:51 good motivator.
5:53 >> Oh that's interesting. So you studied
5:54 criminology
5:56 uh and you had statistic class. You was
5:59 you worked there as a teaching
6:00 assistant. How did you get your first
6:02 remote job? Like how did it happen?
6:05 >> Yeah. So actually I signed up to Upwork
6:09 which is a freelance platform when they
6:11 match you with with with
6:14 >> jobs. So I started working there and you
6:17 know I just remember my first project.
6:19 It was just from a guy that was doing
6:22 some stuff from from their school and
6:24 didn't understand some part of of
6:26 statistics and needed someone that that
6:28 explain. So that project was it wasn't
6:32 that long. It was around $5 the project.
6:36 So but it was really excited to get your
6:39 first, you know, your first $5 from
6:43 online. It was really surprising for me
6:45 that it was actually possible that
6:47 people pay to you know some random guy
6:50 that he saw on on board. So yeah like
6:55 that's how it looks like just helping
6:57 people to to study and people was
6:59 willing to pay you know just small
7:02 amounts to just get things going. So So
7:05 yeah.
7:07 >> And how did this u online work progress?
7:10 So what did you do afterwards?
7:12 >> Yeah. So when when I saw the opportunity
7:14 and that and that people was actually
7:16 willing to pay, I started to learn more,
7:19 you know, I started to try to amplify my
7:22 skills and, you know, I I I didn't have
7:26 any any background at all with any of of
7:28 the tools. You know, I just my statistic
7:31 class was on SPSS, so you don't have
7:34 really much of foundations there because
7:37 everything is just with clicks. But I
7:40 started to to use Excel which I didn't
7:42 know before and I got some roles on
7:45 Excel. Then I saw there are
7:47 opportunities to work with R. So I
7:50 started to learn R a lot and started to
7:53 take a lot of projects and with R was
7:56 interesting because I I even got a lot
7:58 of research project. The downside is
8:02 that they don't pay that much and you
8:04 have few projects to work on. So
8:08 then I got a major role which you know
8:11 it was something longterm and that job
8:15 requires to learn Python. So I started
8:17 to learn Python and I pick up the skills
8:20 that I needed at and this was pre Chad
8:23 GPT era. Oh, I I like everything was
8:27 through courses and documentation and
8:29 try to you know I have my my R code in
8:34 in one side of the screen and and my
8:37 Python code in the other side of the
8:38 screen try to translate because the
8:40 requirement was on Python but I know R
8:43 so I got it in R and then I was trying
8:45 to translate to Python but that helps me
8:48 a lot because I build foundations
8:51 and when I when I learn Py Python that
8:56 kick off and yeah, you know, and and
8:59 pandemic helped me a lot because
9:01 everyone was looking for remote remote
9:05 freelancers and and that helped me a
9:08 lot.
9:11 >> Mhm. Yeah, that's uh that's interesting.
9:14 And so from what I heard from you uh was
9:18 that you first observe the market what
9:21 kind of skills are in demand in the
9:23 market then you learn the skill and then
9:26 you start applying for roles that
9:28 require this skill right so this is from
9:31 what I saw first it was SPSS it wasn't
9:33 helpful then Excel then R and every time
9:35 you saw okay there is this possibility I
9:37 pick up the skill and then I start
9:39 applying the skill right
9:41 >> yeah yeah and sometimes sometimes was
9:44 was that and but a lot of times was hey
9:47 I have this project can you take that
9:49 and I didn't know like how to do it but
9:52 I said hey yeah I I I can do it I can I
9:55 can learn it and do it and it was pretty
9:58 intense you know because I have to pick
9:59 up skills really quickly to the to do
10:04 the project but you know like that that
10:07 also helped me a lot because I have to
10:09 work out all I have to work on, you
10:13 know, on on really motivating
10:15 environments because you need to meet
10:17 deadlines while understanding the
10:19 requirements, but also learning how to
10:21 do it. So, yeah, it it was it was kind
10:25 of that sense of the market, but also
10:27 some some sometimes it requires some
10:29 type of skills. So, I learned the skill
10:32 while I was doing the job and you know,
10:36 because tax is a competitive market. So
10:40 sometimes you can not like just say hey
10:44 I don't know how to do that perhaps you
10:46 need to
10:47 >> someone else like I think that would be
10:51 good when you are working at at a high
10:53 level on a professional experience but
10:56 when you are starting to build your
10:57 career and you're starting to do a lot
10:59 of freelance work sometimes you need to
11:02 push yourself a bit and take projects
11:04 that you don't know how to do it and but
11:08 for me it works really well because you
11:10 know I I was able to take a lot of
11:12 projects and I was able to succeed in in
11:17 you know in almost all of them and I
11:20 even was one of the highest ranked on
11:23 the platform. So, so yeah, I mean
11:28 it's hard. It's intense because you need
11:30 to work out like on on you know you need
11:34 to wake up early. You need to you know
11:36 like go to bed really late because you
11:39 are learning and you are applying things
11:41 but at the same time it's fun. So yeah.
11:44 >> Yeah. But you're also studying at the
11:46 same time. Not just learning and working
11:48 but also you have studies. So first it
11:50 was criminology and then it was
11:51 medicine. like it's intense and I
11:54 imagine I have I have actually childhood
11:58 friend who studied medicine he was um a
12:03 dentist he was studying to become a
12:05 dentist but still first couple of years
12:08 when they learn the basics that are
12:09 common for all the doctors right and
12:11 that was insane it was very intense so
12:14 like
12:16 >> it's really motivating to to to hear
12:18 that you were able to do all that
12:21 uh Yeah, that's really cool.
12:25 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So, you
12:28 you need to work through to a a lot
12:30 through through medical studies. But,
12:33 you know, I I also think that the shift
12:36 gears between two different areas or two
12:39 different domains helps you because
12:42 sometimes you learn some type of
12:43 approach from medicine and you can apply
12:45 to to to to data. But sometimes it's the
12:49 other other way around. You cannot you
12:51 can take things from data and apply to
12:54 medicine. And you know I was always
12:56 pushing to productivity and how to make
13:00 your time efficient and you know try to
13:03 make progress on everything and at the
13:06 same time try to keep things balanced
13:09 and but yeah like I mean I always saw
13:13 like the that like those two things were
13:16 combined because like data helps me to
13:19 pay all my my you know all all my career
13:23 or my medical career. So I I don't think
13:25 it was possible one without the without
13:28 the other and also going through med
13:30 school motivate me to to do a lot more
13:33 things on data. So you know in my own
13:37 perspective I I I I cannot see how these
13:40 two would be you know how I would be
13:43 able to manage either one of of of
13:46 or you know of the domains without the
13:48 other one. Yeah
13:50 >> I see that there is a question. What was
13:52 the remote site where you found your
13:54 first job? It was Upwork, right?
13:56 >> Yeah. Yeah, it was awkward, you know. It
13:59 was a different times, you know. I
14:00 started I think it was around 2016.
14:05 So,
14:06 >> differently. Was it odesk or back then?
14:09 >> What was that? Okay. Can you say that
14:10 again, please?
14:11 >> Before upwork, we had odesk and elons,
14:14 right? And then they merged. Remember
14:16 this time?
14:16 >> Uh, yeah. I I I was after that. I I I
14:21 didn't even know those platforms. So
14:23 when I started it was just on on work
14:27 and
14:29 yeah and the funny part is I I I didn't
14:32 you know know how to communicate as well
14:34 in English with people. So all
14:36 everything was with writing and I have
14:39 to also pick up English skills while I
14:42 was working and learning and
14:46 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. because, you know, I I
14:49 obviously I I took English English class
14:52 on on on, you know, throughout my my my
14:58 through throughout my life, right? But
15:00 but being able to speak with someone
15:03 oneon one and in a live environment,
15:05 that's something that I I I you know, I
15:08 I wasn't I I haven't before. Yeah. So,
15:13 >> it's not easy.
15:14 >> Yeah.
15:15 >> Yeah. Imagine my I I remember the first
15:18 time I went to the states how difficult
15:20 it was to to speak to people
15:23 and I was an English teacher. So I had
15:26 like I had two two degrees like you. So
15:28 was computer science and then second was
15:30 teacher English teacher and then for me
15:32 as English teacher coming to the states
15:34 and then realizing that I don't
15:35 understand the word of what they are
15:37 saying was like
15:39 yeah
15:40 >> yeah you think you know until you start
15:44 talking with people right
15:47 >> yes uh they are asking to spell the name
15:50 of the website I just spelled t work
15:53 okay and uh what was uh what is your
15:55 special specialtity as a medical doctor
15:58 is Are you like a generalist or
16:00 >> No, I'm I'm I'm a generalist. So I just
16:02 recently graduate from med school. So
16:05 yeah, when when you graduate, you
16:07 graduate without any spe speciality and
16:09 then you started to see what all what
16:12 speciality you can take. I see.
16:15 >> Yeah. Yeah.
16:16 >> So now you what's the next steps for
16:19 your medical career? Do you need to how
16:21 is it called inter like do you need to
16:24 work at at a hospital to help?
16:26 >> Yes. So, so when when you graduate from
16:29 med school in my country, you need to do
16:31 one year of service in a rural
16:34 community.
16:35 >> So, you need to go to a rural community
16:37 and start to and you know just practice
16:39 medicines there because even though you
16:43 are graduate in theory, you still
16:45 learning. So, you you are you you cannot
16:49 practice medicine outside of that one
16:52 year program. And after you complete
16:54 that one year, you you can start you can
16:57 either work as independent
17:01 physician or apply from a residence
17:05 residency program.
17:07 >> So what's your plan? Do you have a plan
17:09 for this one?
17:10 >> Yeah. So so my my my plan right now is
17:13 to just complete my my one year of
17:15 service of Europe community. I like
17:17 internal medicine. I like cardiology. I
17:20 I like neurology. But I haven't decided
17:23 that yet. And you know, also um I'm
17:26 trying to see if I can combine in some
17:28 ways data with with healthcare and see
17:31 if I can build a career there.
17:34 >> But I I still need to figure out if I
17:36 wanted to do it before specialization or
17:39 or specialization, you know.
17:41 >> Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense. I know
17:44 that specialists uh u specialized
17:47 doctors
17:48 are in very high demand in Germany
17:50 because there are so few of them. It's
17:52 very you always need to wait like for a
17:54 cardiologist for an appointment to a
17:57 cardiologist you need to wait like 2 3
17:59 months and if you have some heart
18:01 problems then you
18:04 >> right to wait for three months to get on
18:05 a
18:06 >> yeah actually a lot of people that I
18:09 know went went to Germany to practice
18:12 medicine. So it's it's not that hard to
18:15 to do it. You need to know German,
18:18 right? So you need to be able to speak
18:20 the language. But if you if you pass
18:22 that, you can.
18:23 >> But German is so difficult.
18:25 >> After living for 10 years here, I still
18:28 struggle speaking. Well, but I work in
18:31 it, so I don't need to use German on
18:33 daily basis. So anyways, uh one thing I
18:37 wanted to ask you, one thing you
18:38 mentioned that uh some things from
18:41 medicine, from your medical studies, you
18:44 were able to apply them to data and the
18:46 other way around from data to medicine.
18:49 Um so I was wondering what these things
18:52 are. Do do you have an example what
18:53 things you could uh like what kind of
18:56 things you can transfer across these
18:59 domains?
19:00 >> Yeah. So so on on medicine I I like on
19:05 medicine you have different different p
19:08 or you have different skills that you
19:10 acquire throughout your career. H but I
19:13 think one thing that that helped me a
19:15 lot was the organization that that you
19:18 have at the hospitals and also that you
19:21 always develop a plan. So you you cannot
19:24 have a patient without a plan without
19:26 knowing what to do the next day even
19:28 though where there are complicated cases
19:30 and sometimes you you don't really know
19:34 or you know the facility don't really
19:36 know what to do with with with the
19:37 patients in ter in terms of their
19:40 disease. you always have a plan for the
19:42 patient because if not the patient will
19:44 be in in his place, right? So I think
19:48 that always came up with a plan even
19:50 when when things are difficult and
19:52 always know what to do the next day is
19:55 something that helps me a lot to
19:56 organize projects and to know what to
19:59 work on every time like you you also
20:05 you know like you you develop that
20:06 skills to always prepare for uncert on
20:09 uncertity because uncertity is the most
20:12 common thing that you will have in any
20:14 domain in any career in any job that you
20:16 do you you always prepare for the
20:19 unexpected things and I think from data
20:22 I was able to apply a lot the curious
20:27 mindset. So you know I I I see data
20:30 people that is or you know successful
20:33 people that are from the data field they
20:35 they are in general they are really
20:38 curious and they're d deep into into the
20:41 wise. So you don't just stick with a
20:45 with a with a diagnostic. You going to
20:48 the why. And that helped me to to to to
20:53 see what other people wasn't looking
20:56 right or or you know to to try to dig
20:58 deeper. Okay. Why this patient is
21:00 behaving like like or why this is if is
21:03 behaving like it does and prepare for
21:07 and understand probabilities. That
21:09 helped me a lot because when a patient
21:11 cames to to the emergency department
21:14 there is a demography there is
21:16 epidemiology and there there are
21:17 environmental conditions that are
21:19 specific for that patient. So even
21:22 before the patient cames to to the
21:24 emergency room you can understand their
21:27 probabilities to having any type of
21:29 disease. So be able to do that and to
21:33 rank the disease or how likely is to is
21:37 a disease to have helps you a lot to
21:41 know what to study to actually be
21:43 prepared because medicine is like kind
21:46 of infinite things to learn and patients
21:49 came from any different conditions. So
21:53 you know like like when when someone
21:55 cames to the emergency room you usually
21:58 start if a if a patient say I have
22:02 abdominal pain abdominal pain can be
22:04 anything between you know a heart a
22:06 heart attack to to just you know food
22:10 poisoning and the most likely cause is
22:13 food poisoning but doctors don't think
22:15 like that we we we think before on on
22:18 what critical condition can kill you and
22:21 we started to try to rule out those
22:25 those conditions first and then we
22:28 started to see the most likely cause.
22:30 But I think that reranking reranking and
22:33 and you know organizing stuff through
22:35 probabilities
22:37 and going back and forth between
22:38 diagnosis to to actually get things
22:42 correctly is one of the things that I
22:44 learn a lot from data.
22:46 >> Makes sense. Makes sense. Interesting.
22:48 So just relying on probability in
22:51 healthcare is not enough because the
22:53 most likely cause could be food
22:55 poisoning but maybe this patient has
22:58 something more severe. Right. So you
22:59 need to as you said go from the most
23:01 severe things and then eliminate them
23:04 until you find something more probable.
23:06 Right.
23:07 >> Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. And I I
23:10 was checking one website that is
23:12 supposed to be a trash system. So you
23:14 type your symptoms. works with a GPT
23:17 under the hood. So you type your
23:18 symptoms and they started to evaluate
23:21 your symptoms and asking question and
23:23 you are able to see the logs and I I
23:26 think one thing that that those
23:27 applications fails is because they don't
23:30 rerank based on severity. They rerank
23:33 based on just probabilities. So when
23:36 when I did that exercise with the
23:38 patient with with a a heart attack that
23:41 is manifest as abdominal pain which can
23:44 happen and is quite frequently
23:47 that doesn't take into account until the
23:49 20th iteration with the patient. So
23:52 that's something that that definitely
23:54 can be applied to the world of data and
23:57 the data to the world of of healthcare.
24:01 >> Yeah. Thank you. So speaking about
24:03 machine learning zoom camp um our
24:06 machine learning engineering course how
24:07 did you find out how did you find out
24:10 about this course? How did you find
24:12 this?
24:13 >> Actually was through one of your ex
24:17 post. So in that time was Twitter. I
24:20 think I think it was Twittered at the at
24:22 the time still. So I I I saw that and I
24:26 tried to sign up and didn't know how to
24:28 manage things because I I haven't used
24:31 Slack before before that. So I reach out
24:35 to you through through through through X
24:38 and you help me out to set everything
24:40 up. So that was really motivating
24:43 because I I had my first blockage there
24:46 but you was so responsive. So I
24:49 >> unfortunately these days I don't check
24:51 Twitter or X very often. So if somebody
24:54 is waiting for my reply there I
24:56 apologize. It's better to use uh my
24:59 email if you want to get in contact uh
25:02 with me and you get it like when you go
25:04 to data talks club and you fill in uh
25:07 the form with email you get an automatic
25:09 message from me and then you can just
25:11 reply to it. So that's the best way to
25:13 reach to me right now because Twitter
25:16 >> it u it's a very nice platform um
25:20 because uh I am able to reach people
25:23 like you pastor uh but it's also it's
25:26 draining like u you may go there to
25:29 check something important
25:31 >> and then half an hour later you're
25:33 scrolling through hidden videos. Um so
25:36 yeah.
25:38 >> Yeah. Yeah. But so I I found out there
25:42 and it was interesting because at that
25:44 time I was trying to not to do so many
25:48 things because I was kind of burned out
25:51 but I saw the opportunity to to work on
25:54 on on you know a a hands-on course which
25:57 is a which was live which I didn't have
26:00 before. Before that, I I just went
26:03 through a bunch of UDMI courses or
26:06 Corsera courses or even YouTube and that
26:10 was okay to pick up skills, but I didn't
26:12 have the live interaction with other
26:15 people that was learning the same thing
26:16 that I was learning and with instructors
26:20 and also with a pace live course that
26:23 actually, you know, make you to go
26:26 through through the schedule which I
26:29 find the most difficult thing do
26:31 >> we do this on purpose. We do these
26:33 courses in per on purpose in cohorts
26:36 because for me personally it's also
26:37 difficult to follow a course at a
26:39 self-paced mode. So I can totally
26:41 understand you.
26:42 >> Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And you know I I I
26:45 think that that was the first time that
26:47 that I saw something like that. And
26:49 right now it's mainstream like I I think
26:51 a lot of people is doing live courses
26:54 and a lot of people is actually engaging
26:56 in in those live courses with platforms
26:59 like Maven or or so I think is become
27:03 picking up a lot of of of you know
27:08 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And and it was
27:10 surprising because I thought platforms
27:13 like Corsera or Demi will take up over
27:15 the market but in fact it's live courses
27:18 that actually you know is taking over
27:21 and I found it the most helpful thing to
27:24 do you know just learn with other
27:26 people.
27:27 >> Okay. So you found uh this post on X
27:31 then you struggled a little with Slack.
27:33 I hopefully helped you. That's good to
27:36 hear. So you managed to to join Slack
27:38 and then what happened after that?
27:41 >> So yeah, so I I just started to to to go
27:45 through through the videos to engage in
27:47 the platform. I saw that there was a
27:50 leaderboard and you know I'm a
27:52 competitive person. I like to compete
27:56 even though you mention a lot of times
27:58 that little bor you know is is you know
28:01 it shouldn't be your your your
28:04 focus you know you should be target to
28:06 to learn but still the leaderboard hurt
28:10 me a lot and
28:13 you know I just started to to try to
28:16 understand how the lead leaderboard
28:18 works started to submit my my my
28:20 homeworks and started to do a lot of of
28:24 post to you know keep up of the week of
28:26 the of the seven post and you know that
28:30 helps me a lot because before that I
28:32 didn't post at all on any platform so
28:36 just be able to to to share things what
28:40 or what I was learning was amazing skill
28:43 that I think was you know the best thing
28:46 that I did in in in my entire career was
28:49 actually that put my f put my name into
28:52 into into
28:54 the world because people don't know who
28:57 you are and and if you if if if you
29:01 don't marketing yourself, no one is
29:03 going to to do it for you unless you
29:06 engage with people like you or you know
29:09 I I think that was one of the of the
29:11 best things of of the course and
29:14 actually being I I was the first on the
29:16 cohort but that doesn't bring me
29:19 anything besides
29:22 what I did to get to the first position.
29:24 So the first play wasn't important that
29:27 much, but what I did to get to that
29:30 first place, what's what actually help
29:32 me.
29:33 >> Yeah. But um so I we in our courses, we
29:38 encourage the course participants to
29:40 learn in public to share the progress in
29:42 public. That's why we have this
29:44 leaderboard. That's why we give extra
29:46 points for all extra post that you share
29:49 on social media.
29:51 uh but still for many people it's very
29:53 difficult to
29:55 uh to share their progress because they
29:58 think okay I'm just taking the course um
30:01 this course is taken is being taken also
30:04 by many people at the same time uh what
30:07 I what I will share is not valuable I
30:09 also don't want to post anything on
30:11 social media like how did you did you
30:14 have any uh um such hesitations and if
30:18 you did how did you overcome
30:20 Yeah. So I I did have those, you know, I
30:23 I did hesitate to to to do it, but just
30:26 being able to climb the the ladder on
30:28 the lead wall helped me a lot. But what
30:30 I did was just start posting, hey, I'm
30:33 learning this, this and that and on the
30:37 ML succ
30:54 trying trying to market yourself as an
30:56 expert posting things like, hey, I'm
30:58 learning this this and that can be okay
31:01 but I think I I I took a different
31:03 approach instead of trying to put I'm
31:06 learning this this and that I tried to
31:08 own what I was learning. So instead of
31:11 say for instance, hey this is ML
31:13 classification and this is the R or RC
31:18 cur I try to explain through an expose
31:22 here like R secure helps to understand
31:26 how how good your model is for
31:28 classification task and these are the
31:31 steps that you need to be aware when you
31:34 are plotting it or securing in Python
31:37 for instance. So that type of ownership
31:39 of the content help you first try to put
31:44 the mindset of you actually know what
31:47 you're talking about and also you market
31:50 yourself as an expert on the field and
31:54 you know I I I think that was one of of
31:57 of the best things that that I can I I
32:01 was able to do translated that I'm
32:03 learning this this and that that targets
32:05 yourself as a student to actually Target
32:08 yourself as a professional because
32:10 eventually you will be a professional
32:12 and people go through your history and
32:14 see your post and say hey this person
32:17 was talking about he was explaining to
32:19 people how to to do ML classification or
32:22 how to become an ML engineer. So I think
32:26 that approach can also help you a lot.
32:30 Mhm. Uh well, I see I look at the
32:32 questions and I see the question that uh
32:35 uh you started to share your progress
32:38 during the course and then that helped
32:40 you start to to to get interviews. So
32:43 how did this happen like can you tell us
32:45 more about that?
32:46 >> Yeah. Yeah. So actually you know like
32:50 few months after started to to to to
32:53 share things online and to post things
32:55 from from the MLS camp and you know
32:58 trying to get ownership of that content.
33:00 I was reached out by recruiters and I
33:03 even reached out by one recruiter at
33:05 Meta. So you know like that was really
33:09 surprising for me because I just was
33:12 learning the stuff. So, I w I wasn't
33:16 really prepared for for a job at MEA,
33:18 but still, you know, I I I I I did want
33:21 to go through the interview process just
33:24 to see how it feels and just to see how
33:26 like, you know, h how you say to to to a
33:30 recruiter like that or you know how you
33:32 communicate with a recruiter from those
33:33 big companies. I think that's a valuable
33:36 skill. Even if you are not prepared,
33:37 even if you know you won't get the job,
33:39 even if you know you are posting things
33:41 that that you learn, you know, you you
33:43 cannot get away from that opportunity to
33:45 actually speak with someone. And you
33:47 know, I wasn't looking for that
33:48 opportunity. She reached out to me just
33:51 based on, you know, what I was posting
33:54 on on on on LinkedIn. So she reached out
33:58 to me and say, "Hey, I'm from MEA. um
34:00 you know I I I I I saw your that you are
34:04 good fit for for ML engineer role and so
34:09 we we want to know more about you and
34:12 yeah so like I I I I went through the
34:14 behavior interview and that was pretty
34:17 good you know to to to be honest because
34:20 you know I I having a a learning mindset
34:23 is something that they they look for but
34:25 obviously like the skills and the
34:27 preparation or or the years of
34:29 experience wasn't there. But it was a
34:32 fun experience to to just went through
34:34 through through that interview. But I
34:37 was surprised on how easy it is to get
34:40 interviews. You know, it's not as
34:42 difficult as as you might think. And I
34:46 think the most difficult part is to
34:48 overcome your fears to actually put
34:50 yourself out there and expose expose
34:53 yourself because eventually you will say
34:56 something that is not totally correct
34:58 and people people point that out. But if
35:02 you overcome that fear and you started
35:04 to to to you know just to take ownership
35:08 on on on what you post I think it can
35:11 help you a lot. So So yeah. Yeah.
35:14 >> Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for sharing this
35:16 story. It's really amazing. And I think
35:18 the way it works when you uh post
35:20 something on LinkedIn, some people um
35:23 who let's say follow the same hashtag or
35:25 maybe you tag me in the post so then I
35:27 interact with the post. Some people
35:28 interact with the post. When I click
35:30 like, people um who are my followers
35:34 will see that I liked your post. So they
35:36 will also see and they see okay like
35:38 this guy is talking about things I'm
35:40 interested in. Let me follow him. So
35:42 when you publish the next post, they
35:44 already interact and then their
35:46 followers see and eventually a recruiter
35:48 sees that. So this is this is amazing.
35:51 This is the power of social media. So
35:52 this is so cool to uh
35:56 >> to be exposed as you say and for that uh
35:59 um yeah you just need to be active but
36:02 when I say just need to be active it
36:04 sounds simple but it's not easy right?
36:07 So you need to actually
36:09 overcome this fear of or this um
36:14 hesitation of like what if I post
36:15 something incorrect and you say
36:17 sometimes it may happen. You might post
36:19 something that is not entirely true and
36:22 people will point out. Uh did it happen
36:24 to you then when you posted something
36:26 and then people point it out and then
36:27 they said okay like this is not how it
36:30 happens. Did it happen to you? Yeah, I I
36:33 mean I think some sometimes you post
36:35 things that might not or or taken out of
36:39 context can can be you know sounds like
36:42 not as correct. So one time I I was
36:45 reading the AI engineering book from
36:47 Chip Huen. So one one quote that she has
36:50 is that
36:52 like if you AI engineering is build
36:55 stuff on top of foundational models. And
36:59 so when I when I I I wrote that quote, I
37:01 put that quote and some people say, "Oh,
37:04 so you just need to use chip to be an AI
37:07 engineer or nowadays everyone can be an
37:10 engineer." So I think taking out of
37:11 context every things can
37:14 >> it's true, right? Like AI engineering is
37:17 actually building stuff on top of open
37:19 AI, right? So all you need is the access
37:22 to this like basically API key and then
37:25 you can think things like how is it not
37:27 right? How is it not correct?
37:30 >> Yeah. Yeah. If if you simplify and you
37:32 take everything Yeah. like Yeah. that
37:34 that's a engineering. On top of that,
37:36 you need to do a lot a lot of things to
37:38 actually make it work. And I think that
37:40 wasn't really communicated through
37:42 through through my post. I just put AI
37:44 engineering is if you build on top. So
37:47 people point that out. But don't take I
37:49 don't take things personally and I try
37:51 to learn from interactions. So sometimes
37:55 that little post can help you to
37:58 actually reach out to more people and
38:01 those debates also help you. So
38:04 >> right cuz like when you make a mistake
38:07 and everyone is like okay there's a
38:09 mistake I have to correct him right so
38:11 they go and leave a comment
38:13 >> and what happens when people leave
38:15 comments this post gets promoted to the
38:18 top of your feed right because everyone
38:20 is commenting on it so then this way you
38:22 get more exposure. interesting.
38:24 >> And that's how Stack Overflow.
38:26 >> And then it's not really incorrect what
38:28 you said. It was more like um inviting
38:32 for a debate.
38:34 >> Yeah.
38:35 >> Okay.
38:36 >> Yeah. And and it was like stock overflow
38:38 like I don't know if you post some
38:41 sometimes in stock overflow but it was
38:43 intense. If you if you say something
38:45 that that people or you know if what's
38:48 already posted people was throughout you
38:51 like they they will point that out
38:53 really hard you know I I have couple of
38:55 of question that I put on Insta overflow
38:58 that had minus three minus four so like
39:01 that was intense and people point out
39:03 hey this was already like this doesn't
39:05 meet the guidelines and so yeah but you
39:08 know like it's it's it's part it's part
39:10 of the deal sometimes you need to
39:12 oversimplify things to reach out to
39:14 people and just have fun with with the
39:17 content that you put there.
39:20 >> I'm just checking my stock overflow. I
39:22 have actually 2,4400
39:24 reputation points.
39:26 >> Oh, that's good. That's
39:29 >> sometimes you just ask a question and
39:30 then you come there like five years ago
39:33 and you see, okay.
39:34 >> Yeah. But it wasn't beginner friendly.
39:36 if you didn't if you didn't know how to
39:39 pose a question, a good question, people
39:42 would come after you. So, it wasn't that
39:45 beginner friendly, right?
39:47 >> I don't remember having this problem,
39:49 but I've been um an active participant
39:53 of different forums since uh I had
39:56 access to the internet.
39:57 >> Okay.
39:57 >> So, I guess I kind of knew the culture.
40:01 >> So, maybe it wasn't like too,
40:04 how to say alien to me.
40:06 Okay, so back to our topic. So you
40:10 shared the progress um your progress uh
40:15 you were taking MLM camp and you were
40:17 sharing your progress but one of the
40:19 things you did you did it not from the
40:21 position hey I'm student this is what
40:24 was covered today but you were
40:26 rephrasing this to be an expert okay
40:28 this is a c curve this is used to
40:33 see how good your classifiers are so you
40:35 were sharing what you learned but more
40:38 like from an expert point of you you
40:40 just rephrased um
40:42 like reframed your mind I guess right
40:46 you framed reframed this in your mind so
40:49 this helped you post cuz also at the end
40:51 you wanted to attract these recruiters
40:53 you wanted to attract more followers uh
40:56 and that helped in order to do this
40:58 because also I guess since you were
41:00 working on platforms like Upwork you
41:03 wanted to eventually also get more
41:04 clients there right?
41:07 >> Yeah. Yeah. So actually in a world once
41:09 you like when when I built my like
41:12 reputation there it was easy to to to
41:16 get customers and outside of work was
41:18 really hard to actually get customers
41:21 but you know after the p after the
41:24 pandemic like I saw world was losing a
41:27 lot of you know the their their clients
41:29 and I wasn't getting a lot of of you
41:33 know of jobs to actually work on. So I
41:36 saw like I need to shift to a different
41:40 place. So I try your course I you know I
41:44 didn't even have a linking account
41:47 before that you know before posting
41:49 before before the the MLS camp but but
41:53 yeah because X was you know I I wanted
41:56 to post in somewhere else and I know
41:58 that LinkedIn was also a good place to
42:00 find work. I I I opened my account and
42:04 started to post in there and and and
42:07 yeah, I I was trying to reach a market
42:11 because one fun thing about posting
42:13 things online is that your audience grow
42:15 with you. So if you're starting to share
42:17 things as a beginner right now
42:21 eventually those audience will become
42:23 also senior engineers in other platform
42:26 and they will follow you and they will
42:29 hey I would I have been following you
42:31 from you know five years and I'm a
42:34 senior engineer I would love to work
42:36 with you. So that type of thing can
42:38 happen and that's something that you
42:40 also need to to to look for, right?
42:44 >> Yeah. It accumulates. But that's pretty
42:46 cool that you didn't really you didn't
42:48 even have a LinkedIn account that you
42:50 just created it for the course. You
42:52 wanted this point so badly, right?
42:54 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a competitive
42:57 person. I I even I even did two capstone
42:59 projects to, you know, to claim the
43:01 letter because I missed the first week.
43:03 So I started with that handicap of
43:06 missing the first week. So you know I
43:09 started in a low position. So but I
43:12 started to climb through through through
43:14 through through through the letter and
43:16 you know like those two capstone
43:18 projects really pay off you know. So
43:21 yeah.
43:21 >> Yeah. Good work. How did you structure
43:24 your work? uh especially when it comes
43:26 to sharing the things u you learn in
43:29 public cuz for me when I post online the
43:32 difficult part is to actually prepare
43:35 content. So let's say um so we give
43:37 seven seven points per week
43:40 >> uh with the idea is that you post every
43:42 day. So in order to get seven extra
43:44 points, seven bonus points, you need to
43:47 have this daily cadence of posting. And
43:49 this is not simple. This is not easy to
43:51 do for me. I've been using social media
43:54 for quite some time and making a post
43:57 per day is very difficult.
43:59 How did you do this? Like did you
44:03 take daily notes? Um like how did you
44:07 structure this? How did you structure
44:09 your uh learning in public?
44:12 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So sometimes
44:15 definitely happens that you know where
44:18 it was the deadline and I wasn't you
44:20 know I have two or three posts and I
44:22 started to you know posting a lot a lot
44:26 on that day like but usually what I do
44:29 and what I'm trying to do is I take a
44:30 lot of notes. I use notion or even a
44:33 Google doc. Sometimes I I just started
44:37 to take notes from what I learned and
44:40 you know it's it's it's interesting
44:42 because having the mindset oh hey I I I
44:44 I want to get a content out of my notes
44:48 helps you to write better notes because
44:50 you have in your mind that that will be
44:53 online. So you do want to have a good
44:56 set of foundations to actually prepare a
44:58 post and
45:01 but sometimes I don't over complicate
45:03 it. Sometimes I just post you know a
45:06 small fragment on what I learn or I
45:08 quote like from from what I learn and
45:13 for instance if you if you explain
45:15 regression model that's a good post and
45:17 you can get a lot of post out of that
45:20 explain you know what what R square is
45:22 or what correlation is like from from
45:25 that single like from that single topic
45:28 you can get a lot of post so taking a
45:30 lot of notes and try to set your mindset
45:33 that I want to make a post about this
45:36 topic helps you a lot and I think I try
45:39 to structure by videos. So I went
45:42 through that video through a video and
45:44 try to get a post per video. So I think
45:48 that helps a lot as well.
45:51 >> Okay. And one of the things you
45:53 mentioned is when you need to prepare
45:56 the post, you need to have notes. And
45:59 when you have notes, you structure your
46:00 learning. So what I heard from this,
46:04 what I took uh out of this is not only
46:06 it helps you to be out there and share
46:11 your knowledge in public, but also
46:12 structure your own learning, structure
46:15 the things you learn. So then you become
46:19 um how do I say you learn actually
46:20 better.
46:21 >> Yeah.
46:22 >> Because you kind of need to regurgitate
46:23 it to process it before you publish. And
46:27 this processing extra processing step
46:29 that you do before you publish really
46:32 helps you make sure you learn the things
46:34 right because you don't want to publish
46:35 something that is not correct. So then
46:37 you probably double check things and
46:39 then you learn this way way better
46:43 right.
46:44 >> Yeah. Yeah. And you know now that you
46:46 put it like that. Yeah. So you you try
46:48 to crunch through, you know, to go
46:51 through everything. Try find people,
46:53 make followers, find recruiters, learn
46:56 better, take notes, having your
46:59 everything and and you can do it in a
47:02 single goal. Like you you can you can do
47:05 it in one go. You can do it in in in in
47:08 just on the course. You can do a lot of
47:11 those things if you put your mind into
47:14 it. And that that actually saves you a
47:17 lot of times because you can you you you
47:19 are not taking from any other place.
47:23 >> Now what happened after the course? So
47:24 you finished the course. You were the
47:26 first on the leaderboard. You had a lot
47:28 of extra points and from what I
47:30 understood you did two capstones. So in
47:32 total you did three projects, right? The
47:35 midterm and two capstones. So then at
47:37 the end of the course you published a
47:40 lot. You had a lot of notes and then you
47:42 also had two portfolio projects, right?
47:44 Um, did did it help you in any way after
47:47 you finished the course?
47:48 >> Yeah, I mean that those projects I still
47:51 share with, you know, whenever I have a
47:53 recruiter reach out to me or whenever I
47:55 have a a a project that uh that requests
47:59 some proof of work, I still refer to
48:01 those projects and
48:05 because what one thing that that they
48:07 excel is that they actually deploy.
48:10 like I I went through the step by step
48:13 on how to deploy the project in AWS. So
48:17 that market that that can market you as
48:20 a cloud expert and a AWA expert and
48:24 machine learning engineer and you know
48:26 so so it has a lot of different
48:29 components that you can but also I I
48:32 took data sets from healthcare. I I took
48:35 a skin a a a skin
48:38 a a skin cancer detection and a
48:41 pneumonia detection. So that also helps
48:44 me to to to fill out the gap between why
48:48 you are medical student but also a data
48:50 science. I I don't understand why you
48:52 are combining those things because that
48:54 happens me a lot. So I I also use those
48:58 projects to fill out that gap and say,
49:01 "Hey, like those are healthcare projects
49:03 and and and it's just going through the
49:05 the whole data pipeline and it was
49:07 interesting for me. I work through them
49:09 and I actually put it into into a Lando
49:12 service that is able to to inference and
49:17 you know and the good thing about that
49:19 you know now now you can market yourself
49:21 as pre GPT era you have to do it like
49:24 there is no question about it that you
49:26 do it yourself so that's also a a cool
49:30 thing so I I think those projects are
49:32 multi-purpose for me and I always share
49:35 with people and I really proud and Even
49:38 though I I I don't do any maintenance of
49:41 those projects at all. I haven't changed
49:43 a single line of code since I put it out
49:46 there as capstones project. But as you
49:49 need to put it into the docker in the
49:51 docker container and you need to put it
49:53 in AWS and like I can also deploy if I
49:57 wanted you know today because like the
50:00 way the the way the course is structured
50:02 is to you actually build things to last
50:06 and to actually build things that are
50:09 useful for other people. So yeah I I I
50:13 think those projects helps had helped me
50:15 a lot because I share you know
50:17 everywhere.
50:18 >> Mhm. Yeah. Amazing. And there was a
50:21 question uh after learning about machine
50:23 learning how did you manage to get
50:25 projects in that area. I think you
50:26 partly answered. So you said that you
50:29 had this uh uh so not only uh you shared
50:33 your learning and that attracted people
50:36 and that managed to get you interviews
50:38 that helped you to get interviews. Um
50:40 also you shared your projects
50:44 uh to show this is what I can do. In
50:46 addition to that uh what else did you
50:49 need to do to actually get projects in
50:51 this area?
50:53 >> Yeah. So one one thing that what when I
50:55 started to post I I saw a lot of
50:57 feedback from people and I started to
50:59 make a lot of followers on on on linking
51:02 and on on on X and I started to see that
51:07 like actually engage with people can can
51:11 help you. So I started to engage with
51:13 platforms like deep learning AI. I
51:16 started to become a mentor of of the
51:19 their courses and I started to test a
51:21 lot of their their courses and I started
51:23 to engage a lot with them. I also engage
51:26 with coding place which is an initiative
51:29 by Stanford that teach people how to
51:32 code in a live setting. So, you know, I
51:36 started to know like like the way you
51:39 expose yourself to the market is by
51:41 actually engaging with people and
51:43 actually expose exposing yourself out
51:45 there and doing more than the average
51:48 person, you know, the doing more than
51:50 the regular people and and I saw it
51:52 wasn't that difficult. You just need to
51:54 put an extra effort to it. And you know
51:57 like I I I think that helped me to
52:01 become like or marketing myself and as
52:04 an expert in an area and you know I
52:07 started to get projects through through
52:09 linking because people say hey I'm
52:11 working on this that I saw you posted
52:13 something about about you know about X
52:16 and Y and and I I dealing with that
52:19 problem. would you help me out in in in
52:23 a in a project as contractor or as
52:25 freelancer or even full-time positions
52:28 that that that I was offered and even
52:32 engaging with communities I get people
52:34 there to also hey um I really don't
52:37 understand this can you help me out to
52:39 to put this into production and yeah I
52:44 mean that help me like you you'll be
52:46 surprised how many people is actually
52:49 looking to hire people in places that
52:52 are not traditional like on work is
52:55 people to find work and people to hire
52:57 people but it's
53:00 you can find and you can get more reach
53:02 in other places like LinkedIn but also
53:06 in communities there are a lot of people
53:08 that is able to to you know to and wants
53:12 to recruit people or is dealing with a
53:14 problem and can get to manager I'm sure
53:17 in MLC camp there a lot of people that
53:20 will sign up because they are dealing
53:21 with a problem that I need to solve. And
53:23 if if they saw you there and if you saw
53:27 you that you are actually engaging, I'm
53:30 sure there will be some like if if the
53:33 probabilities to someone reach out to
53:36 you will be higher. I I won't say that
53:38 it's guaranteed, but it will definitely
53:41 be higher because you don't know where
53:43 those opportunities are and sometimes
53:46 they are in places that you are that you
53:48 don't necessarily are looking for for a
53:51 job.
53:52 >> That's amazing. Um, so that was uh a lot
53:56 of stuff to process but also among the
53:59 things you mentioned that you managed to
54:02 get a place at deploying AI as a
54:05 assistant, right?
54:07 Yeah, it's as a mentor. So, it's a it's
54:10 a yeah, it's a voluntary position, but
54:13 you help people to, you know, when they
54:16 are dealing with a problem in throughout
54:18 courses and everything and Yeah. And and
54:22 actually being there also helped me to
54:24 get a you know an interview with with
54:27 the guys from deep learning AI to
54:29 actually work with them, you know.
54:31 Unfortunately, we we won't able to solve
54:33 because they they they work with a
54:35 financial company to make payments and
54:38 sometimes those payment are not easily
54:40 processed through through platforms like
54:42 PayPal or something. So, we we wasn't
54:45 able to sort that out. But definitely
54:47 there is an opportunity to to to build
54:50 your career in in if you are already
54:54 helping, you know, if you are already
54:55 there in the platform, people will reach
54:58 out to you because you already know how
54:59 to do the work.
55:01 Okay. So you started to volunteer at
55:03 deep learning AI um mentor people and
55:07 then eventually it almost became a paid
55:10 job but you just didn't sort out u
55:13 bureaucratic things in order to pay. I
55:16 understand and this thing with Stanford
55:18 you mentioned there was some some
55:20 initiative to learn to teach coding.
55:23 >> What is that?
55:24 >> Yeah. So so it's called code coding
55:26 place. So that's a Stanford initiative
55:29 to teach people how to code and so so I
55:33 offer as volunteer to teach people. So
55:37 like I think on April of every year they
55:40 they they release a cohort where they
55:43 assign you to 10 to 15 people so you can
55:46 teach them how to code following
55:50 a a Stanford curriculum like the actual
55:53 Stanford curriculum that they they went
55:55 to to learn how to code in the first in
55:57 a computer science degree. So you you
55:59 you you go to with people to to that
56:03 curriculum and you know I offer to to to
56:07 volunteer there and and I I teach a lot
56:09 of people there and also try to do the
56:12 extra malls talking with them and
56:15 providing feedback and suggesting things
56:17 and you know I actually mentioned your
56:19 your your courses as one of the of the
56:23 of the highest you know people don't
56:26 drop out from your courses as much as
56:28 other courses. So actually reference
56:30 them so they can also because they also
56:34 do a research lab there. So they re do
56:38 research on people and try to understand
56:41 what actually helps people to stay on
56:44 track of a course and a lot of things
56:48 you you was already doing it and so I I
56:51 I I just refer to you to to one of
56:55 examples on on a good course through
56:58 through to to keep people.
57:00 >> Thank you. Thanks. So I should I know we
57:03 should be wrapping up. Uh there's a
57:05 question I see uh from um somebody um I
57:09 think you answered this question but um
57:12 let me just read it out. Um education in
57:15 medicine and related fields are quite
57:17 demanding. How did you find time to
57:19 learn and work on machine learning? I
57:21 think you partly answered that but maybe
57:23 you can give us an extended answer and
57:26 then we'll just wrap up after that.
57:28 >> Yeah. Yeah. So so so
57:31 yeah. So, so, so medicine has a lot a
57:33 lot of content and also data like is is
57:37 a lot through through go through all
57:40 through all but I think what what I was
57:43 able to do is try to crunch everything
57:46 and try to have it in you know I I I I
57:51 wasn't planning to do things twice. So
57:54 whenever I was learning you know or went
57:57 through through your course I started to
57:59 take notes and from those notes will get
58:01 out the post and also from those notes
58:04 is how I would build the the the cap the
58:07 capstone project and yeah obviously I
58:11 have to you know do over hours you know
58:14 I have to wake up early I have to try to
58:17 you know go to bed late
58:21 at the time it was something that I
58:23 didn't recommend obviously the worst
58:25 time that I was able to do anything
58:27 because you know in med school it was
58:30 you know on on final exams or you have
58:33 or I have rotations through through the
58:35 hospital but you know one thing that
58:38 that that I think helps me is to
58:41 structure my time and to all have to-do
58:44 list and breaking down into smaller
58:46 steps you know instead of okay look at
58:49 all the content from MLS cam I was I
58:52 need to watch this video this day and I
58:54 took every opportunity if I was on the
58:56 bus I was watching one of the videos and
58:59 try to take notes like on on the way to
59:02 to to to to my school. So, you know,
59:06 trying to to do that and also, you know,
59:09 like being able to pay bills and being
59:11 able to, you know, have savings help me
59:13 through my rotations because on the
59:16 rotations I wasn't able to work because,
59:19 you know, is you spend over 100 hours a
59:22 week in the hospital. So, that was, you
59:25 know, almost impossible to actually
59:27 work. But with savings, I was able to
59:29 manage those two years of clinical
59:32 rotations. So you know I I think like I
59:35 I I saw actually learn data helps me to
59:40 to do a lot more things in medicine
59:42 because if not I wasn't able to do any
59:44 of the things. So so I will I I I will
59:47 so as part of of of the process and I
59:50 try to enjoy the process as much as
59:52 possible.
59:53 >> That's really cool and motivating. I
59:55 think because you didn't have a lot of
59:57 time it forced you to be more effective
1:00:00 at learning, right?
1:00:01 >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Like
1:00:04 for for force you to to actually be
1:00:07 productive and try to get the best
1:00:09 principles and you know obviously
1:00:12 sometimes you get tired and but being
1:00:14 consistent is what pay off. So yeah
1:00:17 >> same with everything like running gym
1:00:20 studying.
1:00:22 >> Yeah consistency is the key. Okay pastor
1:00:25 thanks a lot for joining us today.
1:00:26 Thanks a lot for sharing your story. I
1:00:29 really hope your story will motivate a
1:00:31 lot of uh of the future students of
1:00:34 machine learning zoom camp. Um so thanks
1:00:37 a lot for uh doing this for telling us
1:00:41 about that and uh yeah I wish you all
1:00:44 the best in your medical career in your
1:00:46 machine learning career in whatever
1:00:47 thing you want to do next cuz your
1:00:50 interests seem to be uh very diverse. So
1:00:54 maybe you'll find something else that
1:00:56 excites you and do that. So, wishing you
1:00:58 all the best and thanks everyone for
1:01:00 joining us today, too.
1:01:02 >> Yeah, thank you so much, Alex. And thank
1:01:03 you so much, everyone. It was this was
1:01:06 really fun.
1:01:07 >> Yeah. Well, I'll see you around. Bye.
