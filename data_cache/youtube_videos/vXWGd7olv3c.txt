0:02 well
0:03 hello everyone thanks for have coming
0:05 today to our event
0:07 so this event is brought to you by
0:09 datatalks.club
0:10 which is a community of people who like
0:12 to talk about data
0:14 so we have regular events like this one
0:17 and we have two types of events so
0:19 usually on tuesday we have more
0:21 technical events
0:22 with uh presentations like technical
0:25 talks
0:26 and this week we had a talk about data
0:29 versioning
0:29 next week we'll talk about model
0:32 monitoring
0:33 then we will um the topic is still not
0:35 clear but the week after we will
0:36 probably talk about
0:39 how you can deploy a chatbot um like
0:42 this is
0:42 quite a complex system so how do you do
0:44 that
0:45 and in february uh first tuesday of
0:48 february we will talk about feast which
0:50 is
0:50 a feature store like a special
0:54 system from envelopes and then we also
0:56 have events like today
0:58 which are less technical so there are no
1:01 slides
1:01 just people talking so this
1:05 less technical topics today we'll talk
1:08 about
1:09 writing and then next friday we will
1:12 talk about
1:13 this role of a developer advocate for
1:16 data science then we will talk about uh
1:19 open source and
1:20 it will be an unusual meeting it will be
1:22 on thursday
1:23 not on friday like usually and then we
1:25 will talk about envelopes
1:27 what is envelopes and what emel office
1:29 engineers do
1:31 and then today at any point of time if
1:34 you have any question
1:35 you can ask it through slido that will
1:38 probably be
1:39 the most convenient way so you can just
1:41 go there put your question
1:42 or if you see a question that is similar
1:44 to what you want to ask
1:46 you can just about this question and
1:49 i will share this link now with you in
1:52 chat
1:59 okay sure
2:02 and just give me a moment i'll
2:06 pull my notes and we'll start
2:18 okay yeah so today
2:22 uh we will talk about uh technical
2:24 writing
2:25 login documentation all that and we have
2:28 a special guest today
2:29 eugene yan and eugene uh works
2:32 at the intersection of machine learning
2:34 and product he likes building pragmatic
2:36 machine learning systems
2:38 and he also writes and speaks about
2:39 effective data science machine learning
2:41 and production and career growth
2:43 and if you follow eugene you know that
2:46 he writes a lot
2:47 every week on his personal blog there is
2:50 a new article sometimes even more than
2:51 one
2:52 and naturally it was very difficult for
2:54 me to think of
2:55 anyone else who is more suited for this
2:58 podcast episode
3:00 so thank you eugene welcome thank you
3:03 thank you alexei um it's a pleasure to
3:05 be here
3:06 yeah um so before we go into our main
3:10 topic of writing
3:12 uh let's start with your background so
3:15 could you tell us a bit about your
3:18 journey so far about your career how you
3:20 started
3:21 that yeah it's a bit of an unusual
3:25 journey
3:26 so i graduated with a psych degree about
3:29 10 years ago
3:30 i spent a few years working on
3:32 investment policy
3:33 so i decided i didn't really like that
3:35 um i was writing a lot of text i was
3:37 doing a lot of contracts and agreements
3:38 and i wanted to work more with data so i
3:41 took
3:42 about 20 to 30 moocs and interviewed a
3:45 few places and very lucky i got accepted
3:47 at ibm
3:49 so while i was at ibm i did a
3:52 competition on product classification
3:55 and then i my team and i managed to get
3:58 into the top three percent and we
3:59 happened to share about our attempt at a
4:01 meet up
4:03 so then it happens that an e-commerce
4:05 startup was facing a similar problem
4:07 about how to categorize products
4:09 correctly
4:10 and they had someone in the audience so
4:12 they invited me in for lunch
4:14 and asked how i would solve the problem
4:16 for them you know different
4:17 different different languages in vietnam
4:19 and indonesia and english
4:21 and and the next day they offered me a
4:23 job and
4:24 i was excited to experience how startup
4:27 was like i was pretty early in my career
4:29 then
4:29 and i joined as their third data
4:31 scientist
4:33 so that startup was lazada a few years
4:36 later
4:36 alibaba acquired us and i moved on to a
4:38 health tech startup
4:39 unfortunately that didn't work out very
4:41 well but so
4:42 now here i am i'm now an applied
4:44 scientist at amazon in seattle
4:47 so i'm working on recommendation and
4:48 machine learning systems right now
4:50 so if anyone tells you that kaggle is a
4:53 waste of time you're
4:54 leaving proof and i was really lucky
4:58 yeah actually there is an article about
5:01 your career journey right and this is
5:03 one of your most
5:04 viewed one right from uh how is it
5:06 called
5:07 uh i i i'll post the link later i'll
5:10 find the link and i'll share it later
5:12 it's a pretty detailed uh career journey
5:15 like uh
5:16 that's uh that's an awesome read i
5:17 recommend everyone to
5:19 to go like pretty much every other
5:21 article that you wrote
5:23 and you know since we talked about
5:25 writing today i'm curious when did you
5:27 start
5:28 writing and by writing i mean like
5:31 internal not necessarily like technical
5:33 documentation because like when you just
5:35 start your career i guess you need to
5:38 write a bit uh but like
5:41 something external like blogging uh
5:44 when did you start doing that yeah so
5:46 i'm looking at my
5:48 and my site now and my first post is
5:50 from september 2015
5:52 uh so this was uh sort of a report for
5:56 datakind which is an
5:57 ngo that works on projects so this was a
6:01 project accelerator with a few ngos that
6:03 we were trying to help out
6:04 so and why did i write that they were
6:07 just asking for volunteers to write so i
6:09 volunteered
6:10 um why did i volunteer i'll admit
6:14 that my reason for volunteering was not
6:16 entirely altruistic
6:17 i volunteered because i wanted to
6:19 practice writing
6:21 so now i know i know alexa asks when did
6:23 i start writing
6:24 but i also want to answer the question
6:26 of why did i start writing
6:28 which i think is a very important one um
6:30 so why do i want to
6:32 volunteer and practice my writing so
6:34 back then
6:35 i interviewed data scientists and data
6:38 science leads that i admired some of
6:40 them two to three steps ahead of me
6:42 similar to how i interviewed alexa a few
6:44 months ago for the informal mentors
6:46 series
6:46 yes i'm not steps ahead of you
6:50 so the key question i asked them was
6:54 what skills do i need to be an effective
6:56 data scientist
6:58 so was it domain expertise ninja hacking
7:00 skills
7:01 phd level research data pipelining what
7:04 was it
7:06 the answer i got really surprised me um
7:09 anyone want to make a guess
7:12 i guess not everyone's too shy i can try
7:17 business skills or no you know
7:20 they say that all that all that could be
7:22 learned but the thing that
7:23 really made someone on their team
7:25 someone they know really stand out was
7:27 the ability to communicate
7:29 the ability to write the ability to
7:31 speak with non-technical speakers
7:33 with that so that at least things could
7:36 happen
7:37 so to be honest when he first told me
7:40 when they first told me that i i thought
7:42 they were just bullshitting they were
7:44 just kidding kidding me
7:46 so but then i just decided okay i asked
7:47 them this 80
7:49 of them say the same thing i'm gonna try
7:51 it for one year so for one year any time
7:53 that people need something to
7:54 be written i'm gonna do that so i wrote
7:57 that for a year
7:58 and in that same year i also spoke at my
8:00 very first meet up
8:02 which is about the cargo competition and
8:05 in that
8:06 one year so many good things happened to
8:08 me and i decided that hey you know i'm
8:10 gonna
8:10 try this again for another year and so
8:13 that eventually became a habit
8:15 so i guess a long long answer i started
8:18 writing about five years ago because
8:19 people told me to
8:20 write because they said that this is
8:22 important for you to be effective
8:24 and that's why i did it and actually
8:27 ricky in chad
8:28 wrote that communication so he correctly
8:31 got it yes he got it um
8:35 yeah and so this is i guess what keeps
8:38 you motivated right because i think it's
8:40 pretty
8:41 like for me personally like i know that
8:44 writing
8:44 is important right i know all these
8:46 benefits that it can give me
8:48 like all these connections and every
8:49 time i post something
8:51 like some people reach out to me and ask
8:53 things but still it's very difficult to
8:56 uh because you know writing is difficult
8:58 it takes a lot of time like it takes
9:00 preparation and
9:01 sometimes like you even interview some
9:04 people right to actually get material to
9:07 it takes a lot of time a lot of effort
9:10 so
9:11 and reward is not immediate right so
9:13 yeah
9:14 you still need to put to put a lot of
9:16 effort and then you need to do this
9:18 regularly
9:18 so what keeps you motivated like this
9:21 reward
9:22 or something something else that's a
9:25 that's a good question actually
9:26 so at the end of 2020 i actually did um
9:29 some reflection i went back through all
9:31 my posts and
9:33 one thing really stood out uh i was
9:36 trying to ask myself why is it that you
9:37 write eugene you need to understand your
9:39 reason
9:40 so i i realized that the main reason why
9:42 i write
9:43 is to share for example i would do my
9:46 projects
9:47 and i would share with people this is
9:48 how i clean the amazon data this is how
9:50 i deploy an api
9:51 i also wrote about the classes that i
9:53 took at the online masters of
9:54 computer science at georgia tech i wrote
9:57 a
9:58 i wrote a summary for each class because
10:01 a lot of people asking me questions
10:02 about which classes are good which
10:03 professors are good so i wrote that
10:05 and i when i attend conferences and some
10:08 of these conferences are expensive
10:10 so i want to share my notes as well so i
10:11 just write that and just put it there
10:13 and that was the one reason that
10:16 and it's it's a very satisfying reason
10:18 because when i share and people other
10:19 people find helpful
10:21 it it motivates me to write more so
10:24 thankfully uh i happen to be motivated
10:26 by this and that continues me
10:28 right but along the way i also found
10:30 other reasons to write
10:32 um so you know and like if you've
10:34 mentioned about this before you know
10:36 sometimes you think
10:37 you know about something you know about
10:39 something enough to write about it
10:41 and then when you actually write about
10:43 it you realize that you know nothing
10:45 yeah so that happens to me a lot like
10:47 you forget the details
10:49 and you know so i write to consolidate
10:52 all these details and you know to fill
10:54 the gaps
10:55 and that's another reason to write to
10:57 learn to consolidate your knowledge
10:59 so recently i applied this technique to
11:01 topics that
11:02 i had some familiarity with but i wanted
11:04 to consolidate my knowledge
11:05 such as the survey on natural language
11:08 processing since
11:09 rnns up to big bird and also on some
11:13 topics that are new to me such as the
11:14 discovery on data
11:15 discovery platforms and also you know uh
11:18 consolating my knowledge
11:19 and sharing about real-time
11:20 recommendations so by forcing myself to
11:23 write i was
11:24 forcing myself to learn and that's
11:26 awesome
11:28 so i write to share i write to learn and
11:30 i guess the very last reason
11:31 which is really awesome and is what is
11:34 leading to this right now
11:35 is something really interesting happens
11:37 when you write online
11:40 people start reaching out to you for
11:42 feedback to discuss ideas they say
11:43 you know this is really useful or this
11:45 part could be improved
11:47 and some of these people i'm really
11:49 inspired by
11:50 and i'm really humbled to have a chance
11:52 to even have a chance to chat with these
11:54 people my idols
11:56 that i admire online and this is also
11:59 what led to
12:00 the current chat i'm having with alexa
12:02 right now to share about writing online
12:03 and to
12:04 help people to help people more so the
12:07 third reason why i write
12:08 is to be a lighthouse i'm saying this is
12:10 what i'm interested about
12:12 if you're interested about this i hope
12:15 you talk to me about it i hope to have a
12:16 conversation about it so we can mutually
12:19 learn and mutually inspire each other
12:22 so i write to to share to learn and to
12:25 be a lighthouse
12:26 yeah that's that's awesome and actually
12:28 now i'm uh
12:29 i remember the first time we spoke on
12:32 twitter
12:33 and my first question was do you
12:34 remember what i asked
12:37 no i can't was did you reach out to me
12:39 or did i reach out to you
12:40 i think i reached out to you i actually
12:42 asked hey
12:43 what do you use for blogging because i
12:45 also want to say oh yeah yeah
12:47 oh yeah yeah yeah like what do you use
12:49 so that's uh
12:52 and by the way you'll be in the
12:54 lighthouse maybe
12:56 by the way if anyone's interested i use
12:57 a very simple jackal
12:59 jackal framework and i just host it on
13:01 github pages
13:04 yeah so yeah that's uh that's pretty
13:07 amazing and especially like
13:08 learning uh part i can 100 relate to
13:11 that that
13:12 uh like i think okay this will take me
13:14 two hours to write because i know
13:16 everything then i sit down and then like
13:18 a week after the post still not
13:20 finished right because like there are so
13:21 many things i need to
13:23 to look up especially if it's something
13:24 technical and things like
13:26 frameworks evolve they no longer work
13:29 that's uh but yeah it also helps to
13:32 learn a lot
13:34 and hi eugene
13:38 can you repeat what did you say uh
13:40 previously
13:41 you write are you right to learn
13:44 to share to what else to be a lighthouse
13:49 to find like-minded people to us i'm
13:52 sorry
13:53 to to be a beacon to be a to be a light
13:55 bulb i'm saying that hey guys i'm
13:57 interested in this
13:58 if you are interested in as well find me
14:01 to be a lighthouse
14:03 what is a big big uh i don't know this
14:06 word i'm sorry oh how do i say that
14:09 um to be a broadcasting station
14:13 i'm sending out a signal i'm sending out
14:15 signal i like this
14:16 come and talk to me about this perfect
14:19 perfect
14:20 explanation thank you you're welcome
14:24 yeah i'm curious to know um like
14:28 how you write like now we understand the
14:31 motivation right so
14:32 and this is awesome i can totally relate
14:34 to that and
14:36 but um it's also interesting how
14:40 do you write like yeah you have an
14:43 article about that
14:44 but uh i just wanted to hear it from you
14:47 like
14:47 what uh what is uh like do you have any
14:51 process maybe
14:52 like how do you go about writing
14:56 that's a good question so
14:59 let me share with you how i went about
15:00 writing the wrong way
15:03 so when i first started writing i
15:05 thought that you know writing is
15:06 sitting in front of a computer typing it
15:08 out something beautiful will come out
15:11 it doesn't happen that way um and i
15:14 thought that
15:15 whatever i write must be 100 original no
15:17 one would have written about it
15:19 it must be 100 useful and i realized
15:22 that looking back on it this is a very
15:24 very very high bar
15:26 it's very difficult made it very
15:28 difficult for me to write
15:29 and so how i write i realize
15:33 it's not first not to have that mindset
15:36 right and in my mind so now my mindset
15:39 is i write to share and everything to
15:41 share to learn to be a lighthouse and i
15:43 realize that
15:43 writing doesn't start with writing you
15:46 start with reading
15:47 reading things you're interested in
15:48 learning things you're interested in and
15:50 you think about it
15:51 and then you write notes and now that i
15:54 view it this way my writing doesn't have
15:55 to be original it doesn't have to be
15:56 perfect
15:57 it doesn't have to be 100 useful it
15:59 makes it a lot easier for me to write
16:02 um so how do i write do you mean about
16:05 how i select
16:06 topics or how i how i actually craft a
16:09 post what do you mean
16:11 yeah like uh basically your process
16:13 let's say
16:14 uh you want to write about something
16:16 then you all of a sudden i don't know
16:18 you're taking a walk
16:19 and then an idea occurs to you or you
16:21 see like a tweet about
16:23 real-time um machine learning in china
16:25 and then you think okay this is
16:27 something i can write about
16:29 so now you have this idea right so you
16:31 used okay
16:32 i have some some knowledge about this
16:34 topic i want to write and what happens
16:36 next after this
16:39 so usually when i see a lot of all these
16:42 topics i'm just going to put it
16:43 put a title in my in my in my notes i'm
16:46 going to say hey you know here's a
16:47 possible topic and right now my note has
16:49 like 50 topics that i just need to
16:51 go through week by week to write about
16:53 it and pick um
16:54 so how i write it my process is pretty
16:57 straightforward
16:58 it starts from the timeline and said to
17:00 myself i set myself a timeline of seven
17:02 days
17:04 every week i aim to publish regardless
17:06 of what state is in
17:07 so i worship every week so starting from
17:10 day one
17:11 i just pick a topic that i want to
17:12 tackle i write an outline of
17:15 how i want to structure it so for
17:16 example let's take real-time machine
17:17 learning
17:18 uh i want to write about why you should
17:20 not do real-time recommendations
17:22 and why would be useful and after how
17:25 real-time recommendations look right
17:26 and then how to do an mvp yourself so
17:29 that's the big picture
17:30 and then i started at bullet points so
17:32 that takes about two hours
17:34 then day two i look at that outline
17:37 again
17:37 and i rewrite it from memory so all the
17:41 crap
17:41 all the bad ideas go out and then the
17:43 new ideas go in
17:44 and then maybe at day three i look if i
17:47 if i'm okay the outline maybe i stop
17:49 maybe
17:49 if i'm not okay at day three i do this
17:51 again so i do this
17:53 several times at on the outline section
17:56 um until i'm satisfied so usually by the
18:00 time it is a saturday which is day six
18:03 when i have no more time to iterate on
18:04 outline i'm forced to
18:06 write the pros so how writing the pros
18:09 is just
18:11 just take the outline essentially the
18:13 outline is is pretty detailed it's
18:15 everything is there i just need to write
18:16 it in proper human language
18:18 instead of just bullet points so people
18:20 can can read it
18:21 and find images so by the end of day six
18:24 i will always have a pro sometimes this
18:26 takes 12 hours
18:27 sometimes it takes six hours but i will
18:30 always have it
18:31 on day seven after a night of sleep i
18:34 will read through it again
18:35 organize my ideas organize the
18:37 paragraphs organize the sentences
18:40 find images and all that uh so by day
18:43 seven uh
18:44 my time is up i must publish it i might
18:46 still make if people give me feedback i
18:48 might still make more tweaks
18:50 on the next monday and tuesday but
18:52 usually after that i stop
18:55 so the key part of this is the iteration
18:59 so i iterate on the outline why do i
19:01 iterate on an outline because
19:02 iterating on the pros takes too long for
19:04 me um i
19:05 i care too much about the language the
19:07 sentence structure the right words
19:09 so by focusing myself forcing myself to
19:11 only focus on the ideas on the outline
19:14 i improve it and then i only leave very
19:16 little time to iterate in the pros
19:19 um so that's my process that's that's
19:22 pretty interesting so basically like
19:24 if you let's say look at the amount of
19:27 time you spent
19:29 writing an article like how much time uh
19:32 let's say you spent uh
19:33 on this outline like 50 or something
19:36 like that
19:36 it's definitely more i would say that
19:38 the outline is at least 50
19:40 sometimes 70 percent 70
19:44 so like the most of the time goes like
19:47 and you said it's five days right
19:50 so most of the time goes to this outline
19:52 and then that makes me really curious to
19:55 to know like
19:56 how this outline looks like because to
19:59 me like when i hear outline it's just i
20:01 don't know
20:01 three four bullet points um yeah so
20:05 like how do you structure this outline
20:07 uh
20:09 i can show you
20:12 yeah but maybe like this will also be
20:14 released as a
20:16 an episode without video so maybe if you
20:18 can just describe in
20:20 oh okay okay yeah so the outline really
20:22 is the key section headers and then for
20:24 a section header each paragraph
20:26 what should the key topic sentence of
20:28 each paragraph be
20:29 and then maybe i have supporting
20:32 evidence
20:33 et cetera um so that's it so essentially
20:36 the outline is
20:37 you can think of an at the later stages
20:40 of the outline the outline really
20:41 becomes
20:42 sort of like the actual content itself
20:45 it's just that it's not in paragraph
20:46 form
20:47 and then it makes it easier for me to
20:48 write i just force myself to write in
20:50 bullet points instead of
20:51 you know the connecting structure like
20:52 the butt and the however and although
20:54 yeah okay yeah so basically you have all
20:57 like
20:58 the idea is already there you already
21:00 know what to write about
21:02 like probably you have already sections
21:04 subsections
21:05 uh even paragraphs maybe you already
21:08 have in that outline
21:09 and what you need to do on day six is
21:12 just
21:13 take these bullet points that you have
21:15 and make them
21:16 like uh you know translate them into
21:20 normal natural language like i mean
21:24 exactly okay okay makes all sense
21:27 yeah that's pretty interesting because
21:29 it's very it's
21:31 not very similar to what i do so i i
21:33 actually write
21:34 prose as you say and then i have to okay
21:37 like this too much i need to delete it
21:39 and this is super ineffective and takes
21:41 ages
21:42 and then also deleting things from an
21:44 article
21:45 is uh it's very difficult right i spent
21:49 so much time
21:50 writing this piece and then i see that
21:52 it's 20 minutes i know that
21:54 nobody is going to read this this thing
21:56 right because it takes just too much
21:58 time to read
21:59 and then i have to edit i have to delete
22:02 it and that makes
22:04 the writing process very difficult right
22:07 and what you have i think
22:08 i should definitely try that fully
22:11 understand yeah
22:12 i recommend it i have the same problem
22:13 writing a paragraph just takes me
22:15 20 30 minutes whereas writing blood
22:17 points is just so easy
22:19 because i don't care right and i'm going
22:20 to throw it away anyway so
22:23 yeah this uh i'm also curious like you
22:26 said
22:26 um that uh you try to reconstruct an
22:29 outline from memory
22:31 why do you do that um so
22:35 sometimes okay so let's say you read a
22:37 book right and
22:38 your fri your friend asks you what is
22:40 that book about
22:41 you tell him the best parts the most
22:43 important parts right
22:44 that's what reconstructing an outline
22:46 from memory does um
22:48 i remember only the best parts the best
22:50 parts of my argument
22:51 the best parts of the story i'm trying
22:52 to tell and that's it
22:55 and sometimes after after i reconstruct
22:57 it i would look at it side by side hey
22:58 you know did i really miss out any key
23:00 evidence
23:01 if i couldn't quite remember it maybe
23:02 it's not important
23:04 um so it's like reconstructing it from
23:06 memory is like you know putting it
23:08 through
23:08 a neural network only the important
23:10 stuff filters through
23:12 um and i do that several times yeah
23:16 yeah that's interesting because uh yeah
23:19 i also have this problem that
23:20 like i cannot simply rely on my memory
23:23 and i was going to ask you about that
23:24 but you also mentioned that you
23:26 then still look back at the original
23:28 thinking okay did i forget anything
23:30 and how often you forgot things
23:33 uh quite often um i would always do a
23:35 regression analysis
23:36 like hey you know is this new one better
23:38 than the old one
23:40 um it gets to a certain point in time
23:42 the difference is very small that's when
23:43 you know you can sort of start
23:44 converting it to pros
23:46 yeah okay so you do this every day every
23:49 day you try to
23:50 uh to start from scratch basically
23:53 from a blank page not necessary i it
23:56 depends
23:57 okay so some days there are some days
24:00 where i can't finish the outline so that
24:02 will be when i continue um on the days
24:04 where the previous day i completed an
24:05 outline
24:06 and if i'm not satisfied with it yet i
24:08 would try to rewrite it that's when
24:09 if i'm satisfied with it i would just
24:11 start writing my pros earlier
24:13 you know so i gotta have a bit of a
24:14 break on the weekends
24:16 okay having a break is important right
24:18 especially if you
24:19 spend that much time on writing yeah
24:22 i the the problem i can tell you the
24:24 problem with me is
24:26 i'm a very slow writer um i'm a very
24:29 slow thinker
24:30 so that's why i need to spend a lot of
24:31 time on it i hope that um if any of you
24:33 here are trying to write
24:34 i hope that you won't have the same
24:35 problem but this is the problem that i
24:37 have that's why
24:38 iterating to the outline helps me a lot
24:41 yeah that's interesting because on this
24:42 like when you read a post and then you
24:46 know that this person publishes every
24:48 week
24:49 it's very difficult to you know see this
24:52 process like all this
24:54 all this work that the writer has to do
24:57 and then you say you're a slow writer
24:59 and then if i go to your
25:01 book and then i see the number of things
25:03 you publish that
25:05 that makes it i mean if you think about
25:08 it
25:08 it's like one to two hours every weekday
25:11 in the morning
25:12 that's like seven hours and then over
25:14 the weekends i say it's like
25:16 13 hours plus enough five hours for
25:18 final editing that's like 25 hours a
25:20 week
25:22 uh so it does take a bit of time yeah
25:26 and we also mentioned you have a some
25:29 list of topics like
25:30 as i understood the list of ideas you
25:32 mentioned
25:33 you have around 50 right yeah
25:36 how how do you i'm curious like
25:40 even before that like before you start
25:42 writing
25:43 how do you like you have some sort of
25:46 backlog let's say right and how do you
25:47 put things on that backlog and
25:49 where do you take ideas from so
25:52 a lot of times um when i look back at
25:55 what i write so
25:56 uh when i see people are uncertain
26:00 about such topics for example one thing
26:02 that frankly remind me is
26:04 whenever i share that my team runs on
26:07 scrum we use agile instagram people
26:08 always ask
26:09 how do you do that how is it like and i
26:11 was like okay
26:12 when enough people ask me about it i'm
26:14 gonna write about people always ask me
26:16 how did you get from a psychology degree
26:18 into data science so many people asked
26:20 about it
26:20 i just decided to write it so i get a
26:23 lot of questions
26:24 so i decide write it and then you can
26:25 scale indefinitely right
26:28 um that's one way sometimes i also write
26:30 about topics
26:31 i would like to disagree on
26:34 for example i saw this reddit post which
26:36 had 10 different roles in data science
26:38 we have scientists decision scientists
26:40 product data scientists ai engineer ml
26:42 engineer ai product manager all this
26:45 i i disagree i think data science data
26:48 scientists should be more end to end
26:50 and alexa feels the same way he thinks
26:52 that data scientist should be more full
26:53 stack
26:54 i don't think that's a good direction i
26:56 was writing in i thought what i was
26:57 writing is
26:58 was an unpopular opinion but netflix and
27:02 stitch fix adopts the same approach but
27:04 turned out to be surprisingly popular
27:07 um sometimes i also see people focusing
27:09 on the wrong things
27:11 for example a lot of my men people reach
27:13 out to me they ask me is coding
27:15 important
27:16 is writing they're important they say
27:17 writing documentation takes a lot of
27:18 time
27:20 i disagree i think writing becomes more
27:22 important
27:23 in your career as you progress sometimes
27:27 people ask me what's the point of
27:28 reading papers
27:29 i disagree you need to read papers to
27:31 keep up in your field
27:33 so i write to answer questions that
27:36 people get
27:37 i have and occasionally if i may
27:40 i mean once i build up enough trust with
27:42 the community
27:44 i disagree on something and to try to
27:46 share my my differing opinion
27:48 okay yeah makes all sense um
27:51 but you said you have
27:54 three can ask a question and because it
27:58 kind of relates
27:59 to what alexia was asking so you said
28:01 you
28:02 are kind of thinking about 50 topics but
28:05 then
28:05 let's say you have to finish a topic in
28:07 a week's time how do you prioritize
28:10 these 50 topics or n number of topics
28:13 that you're thinking about
28:16 okay so here's my trick i realized that
28:20 people on my that come to my site right
28:23 they really like enjoying the reading
28:24 the machine learning stuff
28:26 but i to be honest guys i can't write
28:29 about machine learning
28:30 every week um i'm really interested in
28:33 it but not to the extent i'm writing
28:34 about it every week so
28:36 um i would try to make sure that i write
28:37 about machine learning once or twice a
28:38 week
28:39 and then i add in some other stuff which
28:41 i think is really important
28:43 for example um next week i want to write
28:46 something about
28:46 why you should not be doing online
28:49 courses
28:49 in 2021 i know it's very controversial
28:53 but i think alex and i talk a lot about
28:55 this as well and he probably knows the
28:57 reason why i'm saying this
28:58 i want to write that to just tell people
29:01 guys there's a better way to learn
29:03 uh because a lot of people when people
29:05 talk to me they ask me you know is this
29:06 course good is that course good should i
29:08 do this masters
29:10 yeah so i how i prioritize to be honest
29:13 i
29:14 i the only prioritization i have is at
29:15 least one or two machine learning topics
29:18 a month the rest of the time is is
29:20 messages that i want to try to get
29:22 across i imagine
29:23 writing for my teammates i imagine
29:25 writing for my mentees
29:27 what is my view that i want to share
29:30 with them
29:31 to help them be more effective data
29:32 scientists and this might not be related
29:34 to machine learning at all sometimes
29:37 so you basically have an image in your
29:40 head
29:40 of the target audience right of the
29:43 person who is going to read that
29:45 um and do you use this somehow in your
29:48 writing like when you prepare this
29:50 outline
29:51 how do you use it that's a great
29:54 question so
29:55 um i write mainly for three groups of
29:58 people the first person i write for
29:59 is myself um when you write you should
30:02 write for yourself because
30:04 let's be honest no one's gonna read it
30:06 if you write for yourself
30:07 you're going to benefit from it the
30:09 second person i write for is my wife
30:11 i hope to actually at least help her
30:12 understand what is it i do
30:14 the third person i write for is my
30:17 current team members my future team
30:19 members
30:20 my like-minded friends of community so
30:21 i'm going to assume that these are
30:22 people
30:23 with a bit of a technical background
30:25 maybe a bit of machine learning
30:26 background
30:27 people who are driven to learn to level
30:29 up
30:30 so i sort of assume that and you know um
30:34 sometimes some of the topics i write
30:36 about uh don't get a lot of traction
30:38 not not very popular like the the the
30:40 topic i wrote about the importance of
30:42 uh writing versus coding i think that's
30:44 a very important topic
30:46 but it didn't get as much fraction as i
30:47 like but maybe the community is not
30:49 ready for it yet
30:50 but maybe some time so yes i do have a
30:53 specific group of people
30:54 my future teammates and my current
30:56 teammates in my industry
31:00 okay and like um
31:06 sorry i get a bit of a destruction uh
31:09 yeah the kindergartens are closed
31:13 okay can i ask a question in the
31:15 meantime please
31:16 yes uh you have a very very uh
31:19 first of all thanks for the all the
31:20 detail and um it resonates in in
31:23 a lot of respects and you have a very
31:25 organized uh
31:27 workflow for for go for reviewing the
31:30 draft reviewing the concept
31:32 and i was wondering does it ever happen
31:36 that
31:36 there's some tipping point then
31:39 editing it more makes your text
31:43 worse like
31:46 sometimes like you you know that you
31:48 would have to release it and
31:50 you know that the extra time spent on
31:52 the on editing
31:54 or drafting would just make things worse
31:57 or it's always kind of linear so do you
32:00 see any non-linearities in your writing
32:03 process
32:04 that's a good question so let me answer
32:06 when is the tipping point the tipping
32:08 point is usually sunday night
32:10 i would love to edit it past sunday
32:12 night i can't i must release it by
32:13 sunday night
32:15 so do further iterations make it worse
32:18 yes further iterations can make it worse
32:20 that's why when i iterate on outlines i
32:22 always compare them side by side
32:24 which one communicates my story the the
32:27 message i'm trying to get across better
32:28 when i'm editing paragraphs um i will
32:32 just type a new paragraph above the old
32:33 paragraph i compare two paragraphs
32:36 um usually my metric for success is it
32:38 shorter
32:39 and conveys all the key ideas if it is
32:41 yes if it's longer
32:43 and it gets a bit more messed up it's a
32:44 bit harder to write that's when you know
32:46 it's worse and you delete it
32:47 um so it can regress you can regress and
32:50 you should always
32:51 try to do some sort of regression
32:52 analysis to this check
32:54 is it better okay
32:57 this is what we mean by regression
32:59 analysis i was going to ask that
33:01 i'm sorry if it has to do anything with
33:05 linear regression
33:06 no no yeah it's like testing regression
33:08 yeah
33:09 okay yeah so do you also see your result
33:12 as a product
33:14 oh yes uh design product life
33:18 and life you know versioning
33:21 yeah i i do i i imagine
33:25 every everything i write is like a small
33:27 package of love
33:30 so if
33:33 see when i write about stuff i really
33:36 want to
33:36 help people understand about it if they
33:39 don't understand about it then i fail
33:41 so that means my product ux is bad if i
33:43 write about a product and the substance
33:45 is not there it's not useful
33:46 that means the back end is bad so it's
33:50 very difficult
33:51 and i don't think i will ever get there
33:53 but the way for me to do this
33:54 is to just force myself to write every
33:56 week and
33:58 every week there'll be 50 iterations or
34:01 rather 50 different products and i would
34:02 have getting enough practice
34:04 maybe in five ten years i would be good
34:06 enough um i don't know
34:09 five ten years like if now your articles
34:12 are that good like what will happen in
34:14 five ten years
34:15 um in five ten years i can write the
34:17 same thing in
34:18 five hours instead of 20. yeah
34:22 do you somehow try to control the length
34:24 because for me
34:25 personally this is a problem because
34:27 like i have this idea but to actually
34:29 elaborate
34:30 um this idea like it takes just too much
34:33 space like i need too many pages and
34:35 then i know that people
34:36 with the attention span we have today
34:39 like people will not just
34:40 will not read this um how do you over
34:42 like
34:43 first of all is this a problem for you
34:45 and if it is like how do you overcome
34:47 this
34:49 um this is an interesting question so
34:51 i've i've read
34:52 and a lot of people have told me that
34:54 the ideal length for an article
34:56 is about 1 500 words that's about 10
34:59 minutes and that's the
35:00 average attention span of you can get
35:02 from reading online
35:04 but honestly before this and even right
35:07 now after this i i don't really think
35:09 about it
35:10 i want to write just enough to
35:13 communicate
35:14 the substance and the content and the
35:16 message across
35:17 um sometimes this is just 600 words or a
35:20 thousand
35:21 and if that's it perfect sometimes i
35:24 need to go into
35:25 four thousand words five thousand words
35:27 like the one about my
35:29 the recent one about real-time
35:30 recommendations
35:32 i feel that if i cut out anything if i
35:34 cut off any paragraph
35:35 it loses the big picture and that's fine
35:39 because the assumption is this i assume
35:41 that my audience are people
35:42 like me my future team members my
35:44 current team members
35:46 people who want to learn about real-time
35:47 recommendations i assume that they are
35:49 already
35:49 highly interested in it and they will
35:51 read it and i don't expect them to read
35:52 it all at once
35:53 they can really refer to it anytime but
35:56 to be honest i don't have a
35:58 i don't have a maximum length yeah and i
36:01 just try to keep it as short as i can
36:03 because it's also um courteous courtesy
36:06 on the reader's time
36:08 and i guess having this deadline of one
36:11 week helps not to
36:13 uh you know not to put too much
36:16 information there
36:17 yes definitely and
36:20 for me one of the most difficult parts
36:23 is
36:23 like let's say i already finished
36:26 writing something
36:28 how do you call this thing like how do
36:29 you come up with the title or maybe you
36:31 even do this before you start writing or
36:34 how does the process
36:36 look for you when you come up with a
36:38 title
36:39 that's a good question um i
36:42 named my blog post how i would name my
36:45 functions
36:47 in the easiest way that no one would
36:48 misunderstand
36:51 so this is a difficult thing which i'm
36:53 still trying to learn
36:54 and i just try to come up with the
36:57 sentence that explains what this is
36:58 about it's just like how you write
36:59 documentation how you write code
37:01 however i've heard that there are other
37:03 things to consider such as seo
37:05 or how to get people click on your title
37:07 more
37:08 but usually by the time it's sunday
37:11 night
37:11 i'm publishing it i just don't have the
37:14 energy to think about a title anymore
37:15 honestly speaking
37:17 so i don't i don't i don't put a lot of
37:20 effort into
37:21 yeah because like when we were planning
37:24 this event
37:25 i uh was talking to eugene and then i
37:27 said
37:28 like i want to call the event blogging
37:30 and technical writing
37:32 but then you said no no like this title
37:35 you didn't say that it's boring but you
37:37 said okay like
37:38 you should write it the importance of
37:40 writing in a tech career
37:42 and then that sounds much much better
37:44 than what i
37:45 suggested like it's sort of it's not
37:48 just the essence
37:49 because i think like blogging and
37:50 technical writing also capture the
37:52 essence right but this is
37:54 you made it sound so much more
37:56 interesting right
37:57 and we can see that uh like if we look
38:00 at the number
38:01 of people who registered for this uh for
38:03 this event like
38:04 that like this is more than usual so you
38:08 really nailed
38:09 the uh probably it's the title also
38:12 probably did play the role but yeah
38:15 like do you think yeah but
38:19 yes i wanted to try to explain why i
38:21 named it that way
38:22 um so when alexa first reached out to me
38:25 for this i was like hey this is a great
38:27 opportunity
38:28 to get people to write more and how do i
38:31 get people to write more i say it's
38:33 important
38:34 and this is of course a very specific
38:36 audience right in a tech career and you
38:38 know tech people
38:39 are very focused about their careers so
38:42 guys this is
38:42 important i want you to write more so
38:45 listen to me
38:46 i'm going to talk about why writing is
38:47 important in a tech career
38:50 um hopefully i convince you
38:53 to start writing and practicing and
38:54 that's why that's the essence of the
38:56 title
38:57 yeah that makes sense you again keep the
38:59 audience in mind when coming
39:01 and let's say you convinced now we have
39:03 right now
39:04 uh 34 people and you convinced now
39:07 everybody on this call to start writing
39:09 right and what do they do next so now
39:12 they
39:12 they understand um okay writing is
39:15 important
39:16 i want to write more what do i do next
39:18 like how do i start working
39:21 just start writing um i i get i
39:24 i know it's it's a very uh
39:28 not a very good answer but you know okay
39:29 let me share people
39:31 these are the questions i ask people to
39:33 start writing and then this this is this
39:35 this is how they respond oh you know
39:37 they say oh i'm afraid of writing online
39:39 if i write about this it's just a
39:40 summary of articles it's just a book
39:42 summary
39:42 will it be useful will it be worthy of
39:45 writing online
39:47 i mean i'm going to share with you a
39:49 pretty brutal truth um
39:51 and in the sense that your first article
39:54 no one is going to read it
39:56 so just like they say dance like nobody
39:58 is watching
39:59 write like nobody's reading it doesn't
40:01 matter you're writing for yourself
40:03 to practice for yourself just right
40:06 second
40:06 what to write about a lot of people ask
40:08 about this as well
40:10 write about what you're thinking about
40:11 now write about what's on your mind
40:14 what keeps you out up at night um it
40:16 doesn't have to be
40:17 related to your career it could be about
40:19 gardening it could be about
40:20 i don't know recipes it doesn't matter
40:23 just just right
40:25 um so some people say oh i need to find
40:27 my topic
40:28 my my team to write about right and i'll
40:31 share with you about this example of
40:32 patrick mckenzie i don't know if you
40:33 know him he goes by patio 11
40:35 on twitter so for years he just wrote
40:38 about what's on his mind i think
40:40 compilers or drew
40:41 ruby or java whatever happening in japan
40:44 but
40:44 after he looked back and he's written
40:46 about 500 over
40:48 pieces after he looked back after
40:51 several years he found that
40:53 he the things he wrote that's at the
40:55 intersection of engineering
40:57 and marketing were really really
40:59 resonated with his audience and that's
41:01 how he found his team
41:02 but it took him several several pieces
41:05 and one or two years to figure that out
41:07 it's just the same way you cannot
41:09 connect the dots looking forward
41:11 it's only after you've written a lot
41:13 then you realize you look back hey what
41:14 is your motivation what are the topics
41:16 that you sort of write about
41:17 and then it happens so it's going to be
41:21 a long-term process
41:22 okay and uh one recommendation i often
41:25 see
41:26 uh on the internet in blog posts is like
41:29 first you need to find your niche then i
41:31 don't know blah blah blah
41:33 so just what you're saying is
41:36 don't care about this finding your niche
41:38 just whatever is on your mind just
41:41 go sit on your computer and you know
41:44 start writing
41:46 i would say that it's useful to find
41:47 your niche but you won't find your niche
41:50 before you write a lot and that's where
41:53 you find your niche right
41:54 so it's sort of a circular thing they
41:56 don't say that you you first fight on
41:58 you you write a lot then you find your
41:59 niche but you after you write a lot then
42:01 you reflect
42:02 back that's where you see your niches
42:04 but then also writing about the same
42:06 thing
42:07 over and over again is pretty boring
42:09 right
42:11 okay exactly so so that means i can't
42:13 write about machine learning
42:15 every single week right i'm interested
42:17 in it but i have other interests too
42:19 that are important like about career
42:21 about um
42:23 data science processes so i try to write
42:25 about that so i haven't found my
42:27 my topic of focus yet and that's fine
42:30 because i'm just writing for myself and
42:32 my topic of focus is whatever eugene is
42:34 thinking about
42:35 that's it and what
42:38 tool specifically would you recommend to
42:40 use like
42:42 should it be medium should it be
42:43 wordpress should it be jko
42:45 uh like what would you recommend
42:49 um for this i recommend whatever is easy
42:52 for you to use
42:53 um a lot of people spend too much time
42:55 oh i need to find the perfect domain
42:58 and you have the perfect hugo or gatsby
43:00 or jaco setup
43:02 it needs to be ci cd come on guys
43:05 the time that you spend on that just
43:06 spend it on writing so just pick
43:08 whatever's
43:09 the least amount of work writing is
43:11 already really really difficult
43:13 remove all the excess work and just
43:15 focus on writing
43:17 so honestly when i started i use
43:20 wordpress
43:21 it was really easy and just write in it
43:23 it got to some point in time where i
43:25 wanted to customize my team and
43:27 wordpress didn't allow me to do that
43:28 that's why i
43:29 switched to hosting my new site but by
43:31 then i already written like 50 60.
43:33 so the tool is the least of a concern
43:35 just write
43:36 and just push it online substack
43:38 wordpress medium whatever whatever
43:40 reduces your uh barriers to entry
43:44 i think medium is pretty easy like you
43:46 don't need to
43:48 uh to do much there just get an account
43:50 and start writing right with wordpress
43:53 it might require some setup right but
43:55 with me
43:57 and um so we have a question um
44:00 um the question is i assume you're busy
44:03 how do you schedule and prioritize
44:05 this writing work into your daily
44:07 routine
44:08 uh yeah well i am busy but
44:12 um i guess so
44:15 let me share a bit
44:18 in 2017 to 2019 i was doing an online
44:21 masters
44:22 of computer science so at that time i
44:25 was spending 20 to 40 hours
44:27 a week on that online masters while i
44:28 was working part time
44:30 so after i graduated from that suddenly
44:33 i had a lot of time
44:35 so that's when i decide okay i need to
44:37 pour this energy somewhere else and i
44:39 decide to pour it into writing so it's
44:41 one two hours
44:43 uh one to two hours a day early in the
44:46 morning
44:47 um it's just like it's just the same
44:49 thing as
44:50 exercise as meditation it's just a daily
44:53 habit
44:54 and then also um maybe on my saturday is
44:56 just hammering out the pros
44:58 and sundays um just trying to edit a bit
45:01 so
45:01 i do make time to go out and i
45:03 thankfully have a very understanding
45:05 wife
45:06 um but i i think it's possible and you
45:08 don't have to spend so much time you can
45:10 just write short snippets uh maybe 500
45:12 words just start small start with
45:13 whatever you're comfortable with tweet
45:15 all right yeah just tweet but actually
45:18 tweets
45:19 are even more difficult right because of
45:21 the limitation you have
45:22 or you have to use threats right yeah
45:25 yeah and um so in
45:28 by the way speaking of twitter like
45:30 yesterday i posted a tweet saying that
45:32 you will tell us the secret sauce of
45:35 writing
45:36 what is it i have no secret sauce
45:39 honestly when
45:40 i i woke up today and i saw alex and i
45:42 said crap i have no secret sauce
45:47 but i have been i hope i have been
45:48 completely transparent and honest enough
45:50 and that
45:51 um maybe the the outline iteration
45:53 approach is my secret sauce i don't know
45:54 it's something that
45:55 i i'm i hear from you that this is
45:57 something new
45:58 um but yeah i don't have a secret sauce
46:00 really yeah because we have a question
46:03 like how did you make your blog popular
46:06 so
46:06 how what did you do to uh
46:10 to attract people so they go and read
46:12 and then get in touch with you
46:16 i don't know um i wish i wish i had i
46:19 had answered that so i could repeat it
46:20 but
46:21 um i would write there
46:25 and then i would write a tweet about it
46:28 and then i would write a copy that same
46:29 tweet and post it on linkedin
46:32 and that's it and people who saw it
46:36 would
46:37 maybe circulate it and that's it that's
46:38 my only distribution channel because
46:40 it's already so much effort to just
46:42 compose tweets right i just
46:44 i'm just gonna write 200 word 200
46:46 characters and just post it there
46:48 and that's it and um
46:51 eventually i sort of find um like-minded
46:54 people who who
46:56 who just who just uh read my stuff and i
46:59 i didn't really put a lot of effort into
47:00 that honestly and i don't think it's
47:01 very popular
47:02 um but i'm at least thankful that i can
47:05 find uh people
47:06 who have the same interests that can
47:08 engage with me on that
47:10 well you're saying not popular but how
47:13 many times
47:13 did you end up on the first page of high
47:15 kill news
47:17 uh i can't remember honestly but so many
47:20 times
47:22 hacker news is a completely different
47:23 thing um hacker news really likes uh
47:26 really likes disagreements i think my
47:28 post was like
47:30 stop taking regular notes right like
47:32 stop taking notes use as a tailcaster
47:34 instead and you know people are debating
47:35 about it oh this is a new fad and that's
47:38 why
47:38 um so it's a heck of a completely
47:41 different thing
47:42 yeah yeah but um i think it wasn't just
47:45 one post that ended up there that
47:47 also your post about uh
47:51 this uh like the data science should be
47:53 more end-to-end
47:54 right oh okay up there no
47:57 but at least i think this article
48:01 so basically the secret sauce is uh
48:04 disagreement right so find what people
48:06 disagree about
48:07 them it could be and i think maybe
48:10 now that i think about it that the real
48:11 secret sauce is that
48:13 um through a lot of that i think last
48:16 year i threw
48:17 i shot 55 arrows and you know three of
48:20 them
48:21 hit the mark so my my heat rate is about
48:24 i don't know
48:25 2.5 so if you shoot a lot things happen
48:29 so basically consistency right yeah
48:33 okay and uh we also wanted to talk today
48:35 about not just writing for
48:37 uh let's say external audience for the
48:40 internet but also
48:41 internal like at work and uh
48:44 this is also an important part right uh
48:46 for your career not just
48:48 we are not just in just writing code uh
48:52 for entire day right so we also need to
48:54 communicate with other people
48:56 and uh writing is a form of
48:59 communication right
49:00 so and when we write documentation right
49:03 we all
49:04 always need to think about the reader so
49:06 it's not just you know
49:07 an afterthought right so what what do
49:09 you think about
49:10 writing at work like why is it important
49:12 and how you should
49:14 go about doing that
49:17 so why is writing and what important
49:21 well that's that's a very difficult uh
49:24 there's a very different that's a very
49:26 big question to answer
49:28 uh why why a project should need uh
49:32 why does the project need documentation
49:35 so let me let me share it this way um
49:40 before you start a project you sort of
49:42 need to socialize
49:44 your idea and check your idea with other
49:46 people so so so let's just take uh
49:49 uh a document that amazon is very famous
49:51 for it's called the press release
49:54 before we start a project we would write
49:56 a press release um and you know maybe
49:58 the press release for amazon s3 is like
50:01 hey no
50:01 highly scalable um i don't know storage
50:04 at a very cheap price
50:06 and we send it out internally are people
50:08 excited about this
50:09 um if people are excited about this hey
50:12 maybe this product could work
50:13 and this is before we even do any coding
50:16 so we first do this to test the audience
50:18 to check the audience right
50:20 and this is how uh the same thing you
50:23 you test the audience you type to your
50:24 users
50:25 and after you decide to write it um
50:28 if the press release document works well
50:31 then maybe you write something called
50:32 the design document um i know software
50:35 engineers are very familiar with this
50:36 but the design dock is essentially
50:38 hey let's just say i'm going to write
50:39 the design document for real-time
50:41 recommendations
50:42 um how i would train the model
50:46 how i would serve the model what are my
50:49 business and technical requirements
50:51 uh in terms of latency in terms of
50:52 throughput in terms of cost
50:55 i would write that and again i would
50:56 circulate that so this gives you
50:59 writing at work gives you a way to test
51:01 your ideas
51:02 at scale before writing any code
51:05 so that's really powerful right
51:09 um you test first you test it from the
51:11 customer perspective is the idea
51:12 exciting then you test it from the
51:14 implementation is it uh
51:16 is it useful uh is it possible you're
51:18 gonna check it with
51:19 your principal engineers your fellow
51:21 engineers and make sure
51:23 it works and documentation right i mean
51:27 so alexa mentioned about augmentation i
51:28 mean for me
51:30 uh personally i'm a very forgetful guy
51:34 if i write some code six months later i
51:36 look at it uh i would definitely forget
51:38 it and i will be looking at my code and
51:40 be thinking
51:41 what is this idiot eugene writing about
51:44 why did he implement it this way so
51:47 documenting my code is like me in the
51:49 past sending to myself hey you know you
51:51 might think this is really stupid
51:52 but here's the reason for this because
51:54 the data before this date is like this
51:56 or you know because this is the only way
51:58 uh this is the way i had to optimize the
52:00 code so you meet the latency
52:01 requirements
52:02 and this is what it does documenting
52:04 your code does that
52:05 similarly documenting your projects why
52:08 did we decide to go with
52:10 um i don't know dynamodb instead of
52:13 redis
52:14 what's the pros and cons of each what's
52:16 the decision log uh why did we decide to
52:19 go with flink instead of spark
52:22 so you know all this uh i mean at least
52:24 you would have done the research for
52:26 this it would
52:26 all be in your head but you want to
52:28 write it down so that you remember
52:29 and you want to write it down to share
52:30 the knowledge with your friends
52:33 so i think i hope that answers the
52:35 question uh but okay
52:36 you write at work writing is important
52:38 at work to you know test your ideas
52:39 through a press release
52:41 test your ideas through the design doc
52:42 whether it fly uh you document that work
52:45 you document your
52:46 stuff so that the knowledge is not lost
52:48 and you know you scale the knowledge
52:50 more effectively
52:51 and then also like you said uh you're
52:54 right for your future self right
52:56 because you can forget things and this
52:58 is uh that also resonates with me
53:01 because
53:01 uh like i know that if i do this uh
53:05 sequence of uh common light commands
53:08 right
53:08 like terminal commands i know that in a
53:11 few days i will forget them
53:12 exactly i need to write them down so
53:15 next time i need to execute the same
53:16 like create do the same thing
53:18 i have reference and i just can copy
53:20 paste things
53:22 um i also wanted to ask you like you
53:25 mentioned
53:25 um like this uh press release and then
53:28 design document
53:30 is it something that uh i think in
53:32 amazon is
53:33 called working backwards is it that
53:35 thing
53:36 uh so like yeah the work like
53:40 this backwards process what what is it
53:44 the press release is part of the working
53:45 backwards process so the working
53:46 backwards process is it's not exactly a
53:48 secret i mean
53:49 it's online so essentially working
53:51 backwards is what it is
53:53 we work backwards from the customer
53:57 and that's the right way to work right
53:59 so it means that we understand try to
54:00 understand what the
54:01 customer problem is what the customer
54:02 potential demand is and we walk
54:04 backwards
54:05 from it the other way of doing this is
54:07 you know
54:08 we build it and people use it because
54:10 what we build is so awesome but you know
54:12 often that doesn't work um so that's the
54:16 working break was process and alexa you
54:17 talked about this a lot
54:18 first um first do some research what is
54:21 the problem customer has
54:22 before you even train a model to try to
54:23 solve that problem if that's not a
54:25 problem or if
54:26 the the potential effort say for the
54:28 cost save or the potential
54:30 uh revenue is too minor it's not
54:34 we shouldn't do an effort for that right
54:37 so we work backwards
54:38 so the press release um in the working
54:41 backwards process helps us to
54:43 solidify our idea around something
54:45 single uh so
54:47 in the s3 the s3 approaches we want to
54:50 provide highly scalable
54:51 load latency low cost and so
54:54 if the team is going to build around
54:56 that i think i think for alexa
54:58 initially the press release was
54:59 something like uh i don't know you can
55:02 start music with your voice command
55:04 initially it was just that starting
55:06 music via voice
55:07 but you know and over time of course he
55:09 has been very popular and he has grown
55:11 and grown
55:12 such that you can shop for groceries you
55:13 can ask questions you can control
55:15 lighting
55:16 but the press release the first one it
55:17 just tests the market
55:19 are people interested in internal
55:20 stakeholders interesting are your vps
55:23 are your directors interested in it to
55:27 channel resources into this research if
55:29 that
55:31 that is important yeah makes sense and
55:34 writing is uh an important part of
55:37 this uh this process right yeah so
55:41 i think interesting i think i'm sure
55:43 everyone knows most people know that
55:45 amazon doesn't have
55:46 slides uh we don't use powerpoint at
55:48 least most of the time so you write in a
55:49 document
55:50 and that makes it very easy to scale
55:52 right to share something
55:54 you don't need to be there to present
55:55 for half an hour you can just send them
55:57 the document and they can just read it
55:58 so it really saves a lot of time on the
56:01 person
56:02 of course you know writing that document
56:03 takes a lot of time um but once you have
56:05 written it it's upfront course that you
56:06 almost never have to repeat again unlike
56:09 a unlike uh
56:10 uh like a presentation you always have
56:12 to be there to present or you could be
56:14 yourself i don't know but i can tell
56:16 this document writing process
56:18 is very useful and i it will follow me
56:21 wherever i go i will adopt this same
56:23 practice
56:25 and i think we still have a bit of time
56:29 and i have another question for you um
56:32 so you and remember you can ask
56:34 questions in
56:35 uh slider we still have time for a
56:38 couple of questions i guess
56:39 so what i want to ask you is
56:43 writing for portfolio so let's say you
56:45 made you
56:46 you did an awesome project uh let's say
56:49 it was a kaggle competition
56:50 you finished in i don't know top
56:54 20 top 30 like with a medal and you want
56:58 to put all your code to
56:59 github what do you do what do you need
57:03 to put in readme so people
57:05 can immediately see the the value of
57:08 this thing
57:12 so let's think about it let's say i'm
57:14 searching on github
57:16 right for i don't know solution to i
57:18 don't know something uh some cargo
57:20 competition
57:21 and what would i find i would find
57:23 hundreds of repos
57:25 on that on that cargo competition so
57:27 what distinguishes
57:28 so right now i'm thinking what would
57:29 distinguish one repository from another
57:32 i think uh clearly a readme is useful a
57:35 readme that says
57:37 how to start using this code how to
57:39 quick start how to install this code
57:41 um if it has a requirements that will be
57:43 really useful
57:45 and maybe it explains you through the
57:46 big processes you know the data prep
57:48 step is in this folder
57:50 the machine learning step is in this
57:51 folder the validation step is in this
57:54 folder
57:54 so a re i think a basic readme that sort
57:57 of explains it
57:58 that would be good enough so now if
58:01 you're thinking of it from a
58:03 i don't know building a portfolio to get
58:05 a job perspective
58:06 now think of it from the manager's point
58:07 of view clearly i mean if they're going
58:09 to hire you you're definitely going to
58:11 be able to write code
58:12 clearly but the question is are you able
58:14 to document code and share about it
58:16 like what we spoke about um when they
58:19 read your code does the documentation
58:21 recess where they read your read me and
58:22 does it make sense do you explain
58:24 uh explain it well enough that they feel
58:27 confident that you can do the same thing
58:28 at work
58:29 so i think that's that's something that
58:31 will be helpful
58:44 am i audible i think yeah yeah audible i
58:46 can
58:47 i can hear you here but i can see the
58:49 connection is a bit choppy
58:51 hi am i here yes you are here
59:02 oh
59:05 sorry uh yes i
59:09 i guess actually now we are
59:12 uh we're already um like it's already
59:16 6 p.m here so it means we finished
59:20 um so maybe you have any last words
59:23 uh no not really oh i i do have one
59:27 um if i had if i had to share about it
59:30 um
59:33 i'm gonna paste a link in the chat
59:36 so for those of you who are regular
59:40 readers on my site
59:41 um please go to that link and
59:44 tell me what you would like what can i
59:46 write that will be useful for you
59:48 um uh so i i'm always trying to
59:52 to figure out what my audience wants so
59:54 this is a topic poll
59:55 there are a few topics there already you
59:56 can just thumbs up thumbs down or if
59:58 there's a new topic that you want to
59:59 propose that you don't know you can just
1:00:01 share that
1:00:02 that's it okay question again
1:00:06 alexa may i ask him
1:00:09 yes sure okay um
1:00:13 why some linkedin profiles i can
1:00:16 uh ask for a connection because i try to
1:00:19 ask your connection and one of the
1:00:22 things is uh i should say why i'm trying
1:00:26 to connect
1:00:26 you second i the
1:00:30 second option was follow your content
1:00:34 but usually i when i like
1:00:37 the content person i prefer
1:00:40 ask for ask a connection then just
1:00:43 follow
1:00:43 and what's the main difference between
1:00:46 these two
1:00:48 thanks um so that's a important that's a
1:00:51 good question i guess
1:00:52 for me what i do is on linkedin you can
1:00:54 sort of set your default
1:00:56 to uh so the default is connect but i
1:01:00 set it to follow
1:01:01 uh because the connection just keep
1:01:04 building up and
1:01:05 it just gets a lot however if you click
1:01:07 the plus sign that's a small plus button
1:01:09 you can click on it and
1:01:11 the the ability to connect is still
1:01:12 there
1:01:20 yeah but my question you didn't answer
1:01:22 me
1:01:24 what's the main difference in between
1:01:27 follow
1:01:28 a person then ask a connection
1:01:32 uh so following a person is just
1:01:35 just like twitter you would follow that
1:01:36 person but the person wouldn't follow
1:01:38 you
1:01:39 a connection is a two-way follow it's a
1:01:42 bi-direction and you you would have a
1:01:43 like a connection to show that you're
1:01:45 actually friends
1:01:49 okay are there more questions
1:01:55 yeah i guess uh since we're running out
1:01:57 of time and probably you need to go
1:01:58 so thanks a lot for uh coming today for
1:02:02 sharing your knowledge uh with us and
1:02:05 for sharing
1:02:06 also your secret sauce i think like what
1:02:08 you shared with us definitely
1:02:10 deserves uh this this name so now i know
1:02:14 like next time i'll write
1:02:15 i'll try to follow uh your process and
1:02:18 see
1:02:19 what happens and i think it will be a
1:02:21 lot better than what i
1:02:23 previously wrote thank you i i hope so
1:02:26 so um thanks alexey thanks everyone
