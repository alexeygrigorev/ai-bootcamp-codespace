0:03 digital Healthcare and we have a special
0:05 guest today Maria and by the way should
0:07 I say Maria Lisa or Maria what's the
0:10 yeah fine yeah so we have a special

0:20 women in AI so welcome to the show Maria
0:25 yeah thank you so much for having me
0:27 yeah so the questions for today's
0:28 interview we were prepared is always by
0:30 Johanna Bayer thanks Johanna for your
0:32 help and actually Johanna tried the app
0:34 that we will talk about today and she
0:37 like she liked the skin age that the app
0:40 reported so yeah thanks you again and
0:44 yeah so usually we start the interview
0:49 so before going to the main topic we
0:51 start the interview by talking about
0:53 your career progression so let's start
0:55 with your background can you tell us
0:57 about your career Journey so far yes
0:59 sure so um I studied electrical
1:02 engineering in China so I was always
1:04 very close to the technology side of
1:07 things and then I started to work for
1:09 seens I did the transformation strategy
1:12 for the managing board for mobility and
1:14 electrical things like all the energy
1:16 stuff which was quite interesting but I
1:18 always felt like okay I want to do
1:20 something and to like do a strategy for
1:23 something and then do it so if there is
1:25 a mistake or wrong decision I'm the one
1:27 who has to deal with that so then got
1:30 pregnant and during this pregnancy I
1:32 decided okay now it's a time to change
1:33 everything because my life is either way
1:36 changing right um so then I that was the
1:39 like the moment I decided okay let's
1:41 let's found something let's transform an
1:44 industry that really needs to be shaped
1:46 that was Healthcare then and so we
1:48 started the idea of skin with an MVP and
1:50 then different um Financial BS and yeah
1:53 here we are
1:54 today how old is your kid my my little
1:58 one is getting turning five now five so
2:01 you went into that five years ago right
2:05 yeah yes so we started five years ago
2:07 with the first ideas and um our MVP but
2:10 we always as Founders believe that it's
2:13 like for us we didn't had the idea and
2:16 then we wake up in the morning and said
2:17 this is exactly what we want to do it
2:19 was more that we understood okay there
2:21 is an area on industry that needs help
2:24 from technology perspective so in
2:26 healthcare you see like limited
2:28 resources a lot of issues a lot of
2:30 people around the world um dealing with
2:32 so many many things but the
2:35 infrastructure is not that good so we
2:37 always believed okay we have to
2:39 understand the industry first and then
2:40 we can come up with a solution right at
2:43 these times you didn't even talk about
2:44 AI honestly it was more like okay let's
2:47 create technologies that can help here
2:50 um so that's why we started in the first
2:52 one and a half two years more or less
2:54 with like um discussing and getting to
2:57 know all these different players like we
2:59 have the regulation we have the
3:01 pharmacist the doctors the patients the
3:03 hospitals and so on like also the the
3:06 ones at the yeah the farmers with
3:08 medications so very very different
3:11 players in this area and if you want to
3:13 come up with a technology or solution
3:15 you have to deal with all of them at
3:17 least with most of them so you have to
3:20 understand them and so therefore we have
3:21 not the typical Founders journey I would
3:23 say we really spend a lot of time in
3:25 this MVP um status quo all bootstrapped
3:29 um to really know what we have to come
3:32 up with
3:34 right is your cofounder also a
3:38 mom a what like is your co-founder also
3:41 a mom like somebody on maternity leave
3:43 no no no my co-founder is a man he was
3:47 he's the experienced one um from both of
3:50 us he was yeah I would say more than
3:53 seven years in the valley um this
3:55 discovering different um startup
3:57 Journeys and different um company
4:00 and so we met at University very much
4:02 earlier and then just decided in China
4:05 right yeah so and then decided to go on
4:07 that Journey um together ah wow so you
4:12 already knew your co-founder way before
4:16 um starting and then you got pregnant
4:19 and thought okay your life is going to
4:21 change anyways let's start something so
4:24 you talked with the co-founder and then
4:27 you decided to go in the healthcare
4:30 industry right yeah yeah I mean from our
4:33 that was a very interesting thing after
4:35 University all the group of my friends
4:37 most of them are entrepreneurs now so
4:39 most of them started businesses pretty
4:41 early so we just sit together and I said
4:43 like okay I feel like I'm ready to also
4:45 do something and then discussions came
4:47 up so it was not always just the two of
4:50 us but at the end of the day when we
4:52 knew okay this is what we will come up
4:55 with then there was the decision okay it
4:57 makes sense that we as a team like start
5:00 this journey
5:01 together that's quite interesting and
5:05 why
5:06 Healthcare I think like five years ago
5:09 Healthcare was an an industry that was
5:12 not really digitized so they just
5:15 started to think about okay what could
5:17 be different in the future there was not
5:19 even data right people at least in
5:21 Germany started to talk about the data
5:23 gaps we have um and the lack of
5:26 information also for example that that
5:29 medic patients just um tested with male
5:32 um people so not even with like not even
5:35 all of them with women so there was a a
5:37 huge change you can could feel in the
5:40 way of people thought about Healthcare
5:43 right so rural areas for example started
5:45 to say wow we have an issue with
5:47 resources because like a lot of doctor
5:50 offices like the doctors are turning
5:51 older and older and we don't get the new
5:54 doctors um here in our area so it was a
5:58 time where you could feel okay there
5:59 will be a change in the system and it's
6:02 time to do that in a sustainable way so
6:04 it's not because one of us studied in
6:06 that field or something it was really
6:08 more a potential analyzis of different
6:11 indries it's like in Germany so I live
6:13 in Berlin and the doctors still
6:18 communicate with each other using facts
6:20 so go do MRI and then they do the
6:24 analysis right of the MRI and send the
6:27 results by facts to my doctor
6:30 right so it prints and then like it's
6:33 2023 and we're still using plexus right
6:36 yeah I mean let's see you still get the
6:39 papers for the pharmacies like printed
6:43 out right I mean of course we all talk
6:45 about the electronical um um
6:48 prescriptions but where is it right in
6:50 the reality in real life so it's still
6:53 something we are working on even if we
6:55 are very different like digitized in
6:57 very different areas but Healthcare due
7:00 to the regulations and the sensibility
7:02 of data is always I would say two or
7:05 three steps like behind so like you you
7:09 saw in the last years a lot of startups
7:11 Innovations coming up but most of them
7:14 from my perspective were like too
7:16 Innovative then because of course
7:18 Healthcare is one of the oldest
7:20 Industries and you cannot change like a
7:23 whole ship with just one wave right you
7:26 have to like like keep the people on
7:29 board you have to understand the whole
7:30 system the ecosystem and then you you
7:33 need to try to design something that
7:36 keeps what we have but is still going
7:38 into the future I think this is the main
7:40 challenge in healthcare the second thing
7:42 is that every area is working different
7:46 right and every not not just EV every
7:49 country also the cities or the the areas
7:52 like the rural areas because um you need
7:54 to see what you have like the area where
7:56 I'm coming from we don't even have like
7:58 dermatologist or um doctors for like I
8:01 or something you have to go to the next
8:03 big cities to find some so there are a
8:06 lot of specifics and you have to
8:08 understand them before creating a
8:09 solution in healthcare from which area
8:12 are you from I'm from Southern
8:14 brandonburg so from bur just going going
8:17 to the South and yeah I mean my parents
8:20 are still living there situation is not
8:22 that easy so my mom always to Berlin to
8:25 see a doctor it's about two hours right
8:27 I mean we talking about Germany so we
8:30 can imagine how other areas um yeah
8:34 having issues then
8:36 right from Berlin in two hours I can be
8:39 in rostock or
8:40 Dresden yeah true yeah it's like it's
8:44 like it's a lot of time right two hours
8:47 like if we think about that and like uh
8:50 yeah and also like in big cities
8:52 sometimes it's very difficult to find an
8:54 because like all the doctors are in
8:57 advance yeah def
8:59 that's why you know we always thought
9:01 okay we we we should not start with the
9:04 idea to think okay how can technology be
9:06 used to do the services doctors do we
9:09 should think more about how to make them
9:11 more efficient or like to make the whole
9:14 system more like Progressive and um more
9:17 adaptable to the new situations and the
9:19 load of people instead of saying okay we
9:21 need to change something because there
9:23 is a lot of good things there are quite
9:25 good educated um doctors here so why not
9:29 supporting them first right getting them
9:31 on board to come into a new chapter New
9:33 Era of of
9:36 healthcare okay and so you realize that
9:39 there is a problem this is definitely an
9:42 area there where is a lot of potential
9:44 for the digit
9:46 digitalization and then because you are
9:49 coming from the south of Brandenburg
9:51 your parents are still there you see the
9:53 state of health care there and like we
9:56 also talked about the state of
9:57 Healthcare in big cities like Berlin
9:59 it's also like best
10:02 yeah like what is very important to
10:04 understand is like I studied in China I
10:06 was also living for a while in Brazil so
10:09 I knew other Health Care Systems as well
10:11 and honestly I they're working pretty
10:13 much different and sometimes much more
10:15 connected and I I will always remember I
10:18 was invited to an conference in in
10:21 Stockholm um I would say three and a
10:23 half four years ago and they already
10:25 came up with these kind of good
10:27 connection data ources and like they
10:30 already thought about how can can we do
10:33 it because like the country is wide so
10:35 people are definitely on different areas
10:37 so I mean there's so much going on
10:40 around the globe around the world so if
10:42 you like as a Founder I think one of the
10:44 most important things is get aware of
10:46 the things that are going on right not
10:48 just stuck into your own in like
10:50 industry or country or bubble how we
10:52 always say right for example our
10:54 LinkedIn bubbles where we always see
10:56 like um these great success stories but
10:59 keep yourself in other perspectives and
11:01 try to understand what is going on like
11:03 I'm I mean you can see me right so I'm
11:05 curently in in jakara before I was in
11:08 Singapore and I was honestly I had I had
11:12 moments like that was so crazy for just
11:14 just a quick one like we always talk
11:16 about how robots could probably change
11:18 our life or make our processes more
11:20 efficient right but I was in Starbucks
11:23 getting coffee and one of the robots
11:25 just came to me and was asking me like
11:27 okay do you have something I can put in
11:28 the rubbish right so it's very much
11:30 normal already there so things we are
11:32 afraid of or still talking or still
11:35 concepting already already there at
11:37 other places of the world right so bring
11:40 yourself there in the hot spots of your
11:42 industries and try to understand like
11:44 what could be the next level what is the
11:46 next step or probably what you could
11:48 learn out of that right I mean yeah my
11:50 little one was with me so for for him it
11:53 was quite normal to see these things but
11:55 back back home you know um it's still a
11:58 huge disc
12:00 discussion so what do you what I got
12:03 from this is while in Jakarta there are
12:06 already robots helping people in the
12:09 south of Brandenburg there are no
12:11 doctors
12:12 right kind of that yeah this is how you
12:16 could say it yes at
12:19 least yeah so five years ago you
12:22 realized that there is a gap and you
12:24 started with your co-founder who you
12:26 already met before you started thinking
12:28 in learning more about the industry
12:31 right cuz like from my understanding you
12:33 didn't know much about this industry you
12:34 just saw that there is a problem there's
12:36 potential but you still needed to get
12:38 time to learn who are you said like the
12:43 key players like all this uh pharmacies
12:47 hospitals uh who are the patients what
12:49 are the regulations right so how did you
12:51 approach that what did you do in these
12:53 two two and a half years yeah I mean I
12:56 would say we started very rough so
12:58 reaching out to to people or brands or
13:01 like hospitals or whatever institutions
13:04 you want to know more of right most of
13:06 them I mean of course you can start
13:08 Google um you could start like educate
13:10 yourself but then we we really did it in
13:12 a cold way right so we just called them
13:14 or what messages like Hey we're
13:17 currently analyzing um the industry so
13:20 then we got some things out of that and
13:21 you will always if you really try you
13:23 will always meet these Innovative or
13:25 early adopters um outside that are
13:28 really open-minded and like let you feel
13:31 or let you come in and give you some
13:33 good advices so I remember like we had
13:36 several different meetings then in
13:38 hospitals we went with the doctors we
13:40 tried to understand like the process
13:42 they are really going through not just
13:44 what you see as a patient really what
13:45 are they doing in their back end in
13:47 their systems right I mean of course our
13:50 job job in previous companies helped us
13:52 like so we were like business proven
13:54 that we are not someone like we want
13:56 really want to do something and then I
13:59 would say um we used a lot of
14:00 accelerated programs to then understand
14:03 the markets better and understand the
14:05 players better and especially about
14:07 regulations because lawyers and so on
14:09 that's a huge investment for a very
14:10 early idea right um so accelerator
14:13 programs really helped a lot for us um
14:16 and then yeah we found then two or three
14:19 um big players that said that that said
14:22 yeah data is or AI or technology is
14:25 definitely one of the future things so
14:27 why not creating a pro protype first so
14:29 we started in the AR area together with
14:33 um two of three brands first like
14:35 created an AR filter and just to do an
14:38 quick MVP to collect some data so we
14:40 came up at a fair with these um yeah it
14:44 was the lipstick Tryon yeah very rough
14:46 but very Innovative at that time um and
14:49 we were so proud because that was one of
14:51 the first like trions on Instagram that
14:53 were ever published right and then we
14:56 just had a lot of people using it on on
14:58 Instagram but also at the fair so we
15:00 collected tons of data but at that time
15:03 we didn't even know what was the worth
15:05 of it and also not what to learn out of
15:07 it so then we took the second half of
15:09 the time to make these things first like
15:12 understandable like okay which kind of
15:14 data do we have now what can we learn
15:16 out of it and then we discussed that
15:18 back with the partners to see okay what
15:21 does it say for possible solution so we
15:23 stopped doing AR then for a reason
15:26 because this is what we learn out of it
15:28 but it was a perfect very easy ENT entry
15:31 for us a gamification entry to collect
15:34 First Data and first users at the
15:36 beginning
15:38 right uh maybe it's a stupid question
15:41 like but how is a try on
15:46 lipstick app is connected to healthcare
15:49 yeah so what you do when you try on a
15:52 lipstick is you do a sequence could be a
15:55 picture or a video of your whole like
15:58 face right so what we got out of that
16:01 was not really about okay we we of
16:03 course saw how a lipstick fits you right
16:05 from color but we also saw saw the
16:08 issues on the skin so we recognize for
16:10 example more than 80% of people didn't
16:13 know their type of skin in these times
16:16 so that was a huge education lag so we
16:19 understood also for example the health
16:22 issues people have on their skin and
16:24 then that we can
16:26 recognize um things or changing things
16:29 very early already in this short
16:31 sequence so we we saw okay it's nice to
16:35 know which color of lipstick fits you
16:38 but honestly what we see is much more
16:40 about a status quo of your health um
16:43 from your skin right so that was a
16:45 moment we realized okay there's much
16:47 more we can do out of the data of course
16:49 we didn't had the algorithms then to do
16:52 anything but that was the like I would
16:54 say the wled out of it okay there's so
16:57 much more to explore
16:59 and this is definitely a more
17:00 interesting Market than focusing on
17:04 lipstick or makeup like just makeup but
17:07 it's a perfect entry um to get to like
17:11 connected to people and to your users
17:13 because I think you can have a very good
17:14 technology but if people don't have fun
17:17 using it or don't see a benefit in using
17:19 that why should they do so right like
17:22 talking about let's do a health check
17:24 for most people it's like oh I don't
17:26 like it I don't even like to go to a
17:28 doct I don't want to talk about that but
17:31 every woman if you just used your phone
17:33 right to do the health check that's
17:35 totally different thing yes and but also
17:38 in the mar from marketing perspective
17:40 it's much easier to get people on board
17:42 saying hey you want to try out your next
17:44 next nice lipstick color for example or
17:46 the next like eyebrow Trend so people
17:49 think especially women think oh that's
17:51 nice before I'm buy it I can try it but
17:53 in meanwhile you can do so much more
17:56 things and educate people about much
17:58 like so that's why we thought okay that
18:00 was the second really big learning out
18:02 of that so first was okay there's much
18:04 more we can explore there's much more we
18:06 can do from technology perspective and
18:08 the second thing was but it was a very
18:10 good entry because people are very much
18:13 likely um to discuss about makeup like
18:17 these kind of Lifestyle things right um
18:20 so yeah it was a very interesting time
18:23 and um that was our starting
18:26 point I'm just curious like for me I I
18:29 see the connection yes you uh take a
18:32 picture or I don't know how like it's
18:34 probably a stream of data like a video
18:37 uh and then you try the lipstick and
18:39 then at the same time you recognize that
18:41 there are some skin problems on the face
18:45 right how did you know that this is what
18:47 you need to do before you did the
18:49 lipstick up because like you wanted to
18:52 do the healthcare thing yet you created
18:54 on a lipstick up and then with the
18:56 lipstick up you collected a lot of data
18:58 and then like you kind of started did
19:00 you do this on purpose cuz you know that
19:03 while you try own lipstick you see other
19:07 areas of the face definitely not I mean
19:10 that was the learning out of that right
19:12 I think as founder you probably also
19:15 know that like you have a plan but most
19:17 of the time you have to go plan b or
19:19 plan C right so when we started
19:22 discussing with all these players of the
19:23 market we were lucky enough to find some
19:27 that says okay here's a budget if you do
19:30 something or here's a kind of resources
19:33 we could provide or we could do that
19:35 marketing campaign together if you do
19:37 this and that so it was kind of a little
19:40 bit like opportunity wise to decide okay
19:43 let's give it a try I mean at these time
19:46 there were no investors no one saying or
19:48 forcing us to do specifically these or
19:50 these it was really more about learning
19:52 about the market Technologies and then
19:55 AR was at that time also very new very
19:58 hot thing so it was a lot of fun like
20:01 getting to know all these developers and
20:04 AR hubs and all these kind of experts
20:06 seeing what is possible already right I
20:08 mean imagine now we are using filters on
20:11 Instagram Tik Tok every single day but
20:12 at this time it was really really new so
20:16 um for us it was like an opportunity so
20:19 we went on the path and we were lucky
20:21 that at the end of the path we came back
20:23 to the initial idea but this is what I
20:25 always say like also to other Founders
20:27 and me like of course you have a plan
20:30 but you cannot always stuck on a plan
20:31 you have to be kind of flexible also um
20:35 because plan who who knows if plan a is
20:37 going to work right so yeah follow
20:40 follow the path so for you it was an
20:43 opportunity to experiment with AI
20:46 Technologies um VR or virtual reality
20:51 augmented reality I don't know like with
20:53 these sort of things right uh you could
20:56 experiment and you had some budget to do
20:58 that and they thought okay let's let's
21:00 just do a lipstick up right and then
21:02 with that cuz like I immediately see how
21:05 it can get generate attention because
21:08 you like even these stupid apps I
21:10 remember
21:12 like you take a picture of yourself a
21:15 selfie and then it shows how you would
21:19 look like 30 years after today right or
21:24 you take two pictures a picture of two
21:27 people right
21:28 and then how your baby would look like
21:30 right like it's kind of stupid right
21:32 yeah all these kind of things like
21:34 coming up then over the last years right
21:36 but as mentioned we started with the
21:38 lipstick thing there was nothing was
21:40 there that was so crazy like when we
21:42 published the thing and had it on a fair
21:45 I really remember most people said like
21:47 never done something like that before so
21:49 that was like also an amazing drive for
21:51 us like from mental perspective right
21:54 people really gave us the feeling of
21:56 that is new that is hot that made makes
21:58 fun let's continue the way right so it
22:01 was more like we came from one to the
22:02 other point and um yeah I would say um
22:07 definitely a lot of things and you could
22:09 see it like most of these filters or
22:11 apps they not really came to business
22:13 business case then right but from
22:15 technology perspective and it's the same
22:17 you can see with AI now right um I mean
22:20 there are so many different things going
22:21 on everybody says here's an algorithm my
22:24 algorithm is better but it's not just
22:26 about technology you also need a case or
22:28 a business case at the end of the day
22:30 that makes money and makes sense for the
22:32 society or for the environment right um
22:35 so I would say um with technology you
22:38 always go first you can explore what
22:40 what is possible but then you need to
22:42 find the right um the right case for the
22:45 company and this is exactly what we have
22:46 done so we tried different things with
22:48 ar we are AI whatever all these kind of
22:51 Technologies and then finally we came up
22:54 with a product or a technology that
22:55 makes really much sense now so very
22:58 early in the process after really
23:00 founding the company we were then
23:02 profitable what is kind of unusual for
23:04 setups in that that pH but we took the
23:07 time before to really explore and
23:09 understand what we have to do so the
23:11 lipstick up was making
23:13 money no but the lipstick something
23:17 right right so what what I said at the
23:19 beginning was the lipstick was more like
23:21 our MVP and after that we understood
23:23 what to do and then we established the
23:25 company and after establishing with the
23:28 new idea or like the renewed idea then
23:32 like pretty much after um launching the
23:35 technology then um we were able to make
23:37 the whole thing profitable
23:39 yeah maybe tell can you tell us more
23:42 about like okay you did the app you
23:44 collected a lot of data you realized
23:47 that there's a a lot of people have SK
23:51 have problems skin problems without even
23:54 knowing about that so you saw that
23:55 there's an opportunity and then like
23:58 after you realized that what what
24:00 happens after that like how did you like
24:03 from that point to the point when it's
24:05 profitable like what actually
24:07 happened yeah so um after that we worked
24:10 on two different areas the first is of
24:13 course the technology so how to really
24:16 um prove that you see things that are
24:19 different on your skin now and that how
24:21 to prove that this might be an disease
24:24 and having like issues for your health
24:27 right so that was the first area so we
24:29 sat together with a lot of doctors um
24:32 tele medicine was just invented in these
24:34 days just started right um so that was
24:37 the first like okay there are few parts
24:39 the first was really the AI itself like
24:42 how to um see from a picture that there
24:44 are diseases the second one was then
24:47 creating an application or a flow that
24:50 makes sense right so user have a benefit
24:52 out of the technology because just
24:54 knowing you you have probably like an
24:58 doesn't give you anything right so you
25:00 need a whole environment and this is
25:01 when we came up with our app skin which
25:03 is a digital clinic so you can get
25:06 everything from diagnosis um to
25:08 consultation to treatment so we also
25:11 have pharmacies there so you get a
25:13 prescription everything is digital in
25:15 one flow and this is really where us a
25:17 benefit from right not just giving give
25:19 them information also giving them a
25:22 treatment and and an ecosystem where
25:24 they can grow themselves so that was
25:26 part one and two
25:28 and one very important part for me
25:30 specifically was the eics and
25:32 communication of our solution because if
25:36 I tell you in second one hey I think you
25:39 have skin cancer I mean you would close
25:41 the app and say what is that I don't
25:43 want to hear that right so it's it's a
25:46 very sensitive field you have to of
25:49 course not just keep in mind the
25:51 regulations I mean and they're very
25:53 strong also but you also have to think
25:55 about um what you are talking about
25:58 right it's a very respon like I feel a
26:00 lot of responsibility dealing with this
26:02 information so we took a lot of effort
26:05 and onboarded communication experts like
26:07 how to communicate that with via
26:10 application to people very short I mean
26:13 you just have three or four seconds
26:15 before people lose their interest of an
26:17 information but not dropping it too hard
26:20 so this is a balance you have to find
26:23 like how to make a good user
26:25 communication and then also of was the
26:28 ethical part like if we're talking about
26:30 Healthcare it's Crystal Clear you have
26:33 to create a solution that fits for
26:35 everyone means no matter where you are
26:39 which time which color of skin or
26:42 ethical group or country of origin like
26:44 you want to name it um also people
26:47 probably not able to like see or to hear
26:50 or to whatever like there are me I mean
26:53 so many different kinds of people right
26:55 and Healthcare is there for everyone so
26:57 I think this is the main challenge
26:59 creating a solution that is inclusive
27:02 and an AI that is capable to deal with
27:05 all people around the world so that was
27:08 then also a very strong concepting part
27:11 of our business like how to do that or
27:14 at least if you are if you know your
27:18 like borders like where you what you
27:19 cannot do how to create something that
27:23 people can still benefit or people still
27:25 get a response right so that was a huge
27:28 huge concepting part for
27:31 ush
27:33 uh like when you start a company you
27:35 usually need to think about a niche
27:37 right yet with this ethical problem you
27:40 kind of want to to be inclusive and
27:41 solve it for everyone so how did you
27:43 solve this dilemma yeah it is a dilemma
27:47 definitely and that was one of the
27:49 toughest discussions with investors of
27:52 course but we made it in the following
27:54 way so we focused on One Market at first
27:56 like you could say say one country of
27:58 origin for the algorithms Germany yeah I
28:01 would say European skin I mean it's a
28:03 little bit broader it's not just one
28:06 market but more like European and then
28:10 we decided to to say or to to integrate
28:13 a kind of plan B so if there is
28:17 something else detected the algorithm
28:20 have to say okay here are my limitations
28:22 or I need further information so you can
28:25 you can do other things other
28:26 experiences right so we just thought
28:29 about fallbacks I think that's the most
28:31 important thing not not just say okay
28:33 you're out you cannot use the app but
28:35 you can find other ways or you can
28:37 recommend other things so we we made
28:40 kind of um how to say of course we we
28:43 had the idea of be kind of like
28:46 inclusive but definitely with the core
28:48 technology we had to focus on a specific
28:51 Market I mean you probably know it like
28:54 if you want to create a good AI you need
28:56 the data to train as well right so it
28:58 was nearly impossible at that time to
29:01 have all the data for all different
29:04 ethical groups for example I mean there
29:07 was no money no resources nothing so we
29:09 had to focus of course but it doesn't
29:11 mean you cannot find solutions for like
29:14 all the other
29:18 possibilities I'm wondering like was it
29:21 even possible to reuse to get the data
29:24 from the lipstick up cuz like people who
29:27 tried the lipstick on themselves uh
29:31 probably didn't know you would be using
29:32 this data for other reasons right so I
29:36 guess for your case you needed to start
29:38 collecting the data from scratch right
29:40 for this for this project yeah
29:43 definitely and we did so the only thing
29:45 that was very helpful was like with the
29:47 lipstick app of course we created a
29:49 community right so you can introduce
29:52 different things to communities right so
29:55 therefore of course we didn't start it
29:56 from zero Z so we could not use what we
29:59 have done but we could use the I would
30:03 say the reach or the community we
30:05 created to then get started pretty easy
30:08 or pretty I would say like at least not
30:10 from
30:12 zero yeah that's
30:15 uh like I keep hearing about the
30:18 importance of the
30:19 community and sometimes it's
30:22 like yeah clear why but like here it's a
30:27 super good illustration of why it's
30:30 important cuz like these two
30:32 apps are somewhat connected right but
30:36 the community is kind of the same so
30:37 people want to help you and it's the
30:40 same users or like some of them like
30:42 there's
30:43 intersection yeah and that's why I said
30:45 sometimes it's also important to go like
30:47 paths you don't think about in the first
30:50 moment because like of course if you
30:52 have a health application right you
30:54 don't have to go to the doctor every
30:56 single day right and your skin is not
30:59 changing every single day and your skin
31:01 diseases are not there every single day
31:03 or not upcoming new ones every single
31:06 day but especially women not just women
31:10 but especially women dealing with makeup
31:13 skin care hair care every single day so
31:16 still they are doing something every
31:18 single day right so that was exactly
31:20 what we fought with the community and
31:22 this is the border between like both
31:24 things we have done right I mean your
31:26 skin health is not just related to
31:28 diseases it's also about how you treat
31:30 your skin so why not combining a
31:33 lifestyle issue people are really doing
31:35 on a daily base with a health checkup
31:38 and that is then like what you see now
31:40 in our application so you have much more
31:42 things to do than just talking to a
31:44 doctor because we believe that um you
31:47 have to like interact with your Comm
31:50 community on a daily base right it's not
31:53 just um yeah specifically in one
31:57 doctor's case what you could do so
31:59 Community is definitely important and we
32:01 are working pretty much with our
32:02 community so we are developing features
32:05 with them we are asking them for like um
32:08 feedbacks we try to see in the behavior
32:11 like what they like what they don't like
32:12 so of course you can improve the whole
32:14 company and the whole concept of your
32:16 application move that over time because
32:19 just because you have a good technology
32:20 you cannot stop developing right you
32:22 have to think about tomorrow and the
32:23 days after already so um it's it's very
32:27 impressive what you can learn out of
32:29 your users or like
32:33 communities and is it only for women or
32:36 for both genders or for like many
32:39 genders it's for both genders like for
32:41 women for me it's just sometimes easier
32:43 to give the
32:44 example because I'm doing it in the same
32:47 way like for men it was very interesting
32:50 very soon we had more male users than
32:52 female because I think what is the point
32:55 is that they hate to go to like most of
32:58 them right they don't want to know other
33:00 people seeing them going there they want
33:02 to do it more private so applications
33:05 like ours are very much right and you
33:09 you would not imagine like men really
33:11 care about their hair their de bird and
33:14 also like um starting they would don't
33:16 want to age like all these kind of
33:18 wrinkle things is very like very male
33:20 dominant topic um so it's the same thing
33:24 here like you can achieve both Target
33:26 groups but you have to think about the
33:28 content which is coming from the
33:30 community again right so just try to
33:32 understand what they are interested
33:34 in and one of the reasons I asked about
33:37 that is um I imagine that the lipstick
33:41 cup the community you built around that
33:43 was woman dominant yeah because like men
33:47 typically don't try lipstick on
33:49 themselves most of them but yet like the
33:53 the new community the new users are both
33:56 genders right
33:57 so you somehow needed to acquire more
34:00 male users yeah I mean Healthcare is I
34:04 said like it's it's a topic for everyone
34:06 right so everyone is included here and
34:08 lipstick or all this kind of let's say
34:10 makeup in general right was more in a
34:13 specific Target group so it helped to
34:16 have the ear early adopters and the
34:18 first users like growing with us but
34:20 definitely very soon also this group
34:22 understood okay now there's a benefit
34:24 for my my partner my brother my dad as
34:27 well so it was more like a rolling
34:30 effect here like snowball um so one came
34:33 to the other and soon like I said like
34:35 we had um more male than female when we
34:38 launched the healthcare part
34:41 then and also like to your point of my
34:44 not liking going to doctors like I
34:48 myself sometimes go to a
34:50 dermatologist and in Berlin it's not
34:52 really possible to find a dermatologist
34:54 that is covered by um
34:57 public insurance so you have to pay yeah
35:01 and not only you have to pay but you
35:03 also have to wait for the appointment
35:04 like for three months or four so like
35:08 it's not just it's difficult to go there
35:11 and then you wait for four months okay
35:13 in four months like your skin probably
35:15 changes like for example like I wanted
35:18 to go to the dermatologist in May I book
35:20 an appointment for the end of August
35:23 right and then like there's Sun like all
35:24 this stuff and like the problem I had
35:26 before like didn't exist and then I go
35:28 there and like okay you sp you have
35:30 spots on your face okay thanks like I
35:32 waited for that for four months thanks
35:35 for tell and like okay give me 100 now
35:39 so like with the app I imagine that you
35:42 can just you know not wait for four
35:45 months that's already an advantage you
35:47 don't need to go anywhere you don't need
35:48 to pay 100 hopefully 100 her
35:52 so like I can only see benefits right
35:56 yeah definely what you mentioned is the
35:58 core benefit already but it's a little
36:01 bit more than that as well right so as
36:03 mentioned you can get the prescription
36:05 directly do you have the online pharmacy
36:07 so also if you need medication it's
36:09 directly coming to your home if you like
36:11 to of course you don't have to but if
36:13 you like to and the second thing is very
36:16 often doctors say okay here is a
36:19 medication would be very nice if you
36:21 come back in two months so we see if
36:24 it's working or not in the application
36:26 you have the chance like doctor and
36:27 patient have the chance to see the
36:29 developments like of the skin already
36:31 right so you don't have to go there you
36:33 don't have to wait to your next
36:35 appointment if there is a huge thing
36:37 going on you can directly ping the
36:39 doctor again so the whole process is
36:41 improved it's not just the like I would
36:43 say point of like a moment like we can
36:46 cover the whole story and also if um
36:49 there is something heavy going on um
36:52 even if the algorithm or the doctor sees
36:54 that of course we will say let's go to
36:56 the doctor yeah let's see him in person
36:58 sometimes it's necessary and that's fine
37:01 but if a doctor is able to put some of
37:03 his patients into an online solution he
37:06 has more space in the office to see like
37:09 the people that really needs him right
37:12 so especially for dermatologists more
37:14 than 80% of patients are so so to say um
37:19 I don't know the English word for that
37:20 but in German it's called like I see you
37:22 and know within 10 seconds what you have
37:25 right but they have to spend some time
37:27 with the people of course what is a good
37:29 thing on the one hand side from social
37:31 perspective but from efficiency
37:33 perspective that could have been much
37:35 faster and then digital um Solutions not
37:39 just now app but most of the tele tele
37:41 medicine things that's a huge huge thing
37:44 that you save time so the doctor can
37:46 treat more people and therefore we can
37:48 really change the way of how long you
37:50 have to wait um and how the whole
37:52 process is done
37:55 then yeah if it's less than four months
37:57 it's already like
38:00 yeah it's more like 24
38:03 hours yeah and uh there is a comment
38:05 from
38:06 gregar and uh the comment is uh like I
38:11 tried the app yesterday and it didn't
38:13 work for me I find the idea cool um I
38:17 guess
38:20 what what I'm wondering if there's any
38:23 way to get in touch with you and give
38:25 this feedback directly like from the
38:27 chat it's probably not easy to describe
38:29 what exactly did not work and what
38:31 worked is it okay to contact you on
38:33 LinkedIn yeah course I mean on LinkedIn
38:36 that's always fine you can also use like
38:38 on our website we have the support um
38:41 also that's even better right yeah you
38:43 can also write them so they getting the
38:45 feedback and take it serious and try to
38:47 of course make it better I mean I always
38:49 say it's technology there can always be
38:51 things can always be bugs something can
38:54 happen but in general from what I know
38:56 everything should work so I'm very happy
38:59 to get information or feedback when
39:01 things are going wrong so we can improve
39:04 and get better
39:06 than yeah and uh going back to
39:10 communication so you mentioned that you
39:12 needed to find people who can
39:16 communicate experts on communication cuz
39:19 like if I open it up take a selfie of
39:21 myself and it says we have AK okay like
39:24 I knew it already and so like how do you
39:28 do
39:29 this so first of all we analyzed like
39:32 the it's so-called archetype um
39:35 principle means that different groups of
39:37 people communicate different so you also
39:39 have to give me the information
39:41 different than I have to give the
39:42 information to you to make you feel like
39:45 call to action like I have to do
39:47 something so that was the first thing
39:49 how can you measure without knowing a
39:51 person very easy how can you communicate
39:53 with them so that was the first part and
39:55 the second one is then um of course um
39:59 giving you a benefit right but it cannot
40:01 be more than one or two sentences so I
40:03 have to not probably say you this is
40:05 acne I have to tell you oh here's a
40:07 cream that perfectly helps you with
40:09 dealing with your acne right so it's the
40:11 same information my specific timee of
40:12 skin right because like for different
40:14 types of skin different you need
40:16 different treatment yes definitely and
40:19 not just type of skin there are also
40:21 other parameters like hydration for
40:23 example wrinkles pores all these kind of
40:25 things so we started always to do kind
40:28 of gamification to give you like kind of
40:30 the information then some education to
40:33 make you understand the information
40:35 because honestly I have dry skin you
40:37 have oily skin for example what does it
40:39 mean doesn't change my life right if I
40:41 don't know what it says to me I will not
40:44 change anything so I need to tell you
40:46 okay so you have dry skin so for you
40:49 it's very important to act like this
40:51 this this or do this this and that right
40:53 so that was the first part so
40:55 gamification Ed education and at the end
40:57 benefits it's all about benefits people
41:00 do actions because they want to benefit
41:02 from it right so you have to be crystal
41:05 clear on what you are offering and how
41:08 they will come to the benefit from the
41:10 first
41:11 moment I mean for sure right you spend
41:15 time you give data you sometimes pay
41:17 money of course you want to know why
41:21 yeah yeah
41:22 exactly uh how is your company now oh
41:27 how large is your company how many
41:28 people do do around 20 people now 20
41:33 people
41:36 Y and how did you because I imagine two
41:39 and a half years ago it was just you and
41:41 your cofounder right like how did it
41:44 start from there till
41:47 today yeah I mean we went on with
41:49 financial rounds right so with every
41:51 Financial round we could grow the
41:53 company we um we also do like
41:57 freelancing in specific areas like
41:59 projectwise of course right um so I I
42:03 would say there was a very sustainable
42:04 growing over the last years um so it was
42:07 not one one from one day to the other
42:09 from two to 10 people or something it's
42:12 more like okay let's see uh when we need
42:16 new resources what is now important so
42:18 for example we just closed our last
42:20 Financial round for now it's very
42:22 specific for Tech because we have good
42:24 visions and very important things to do
42:26 on the technical side so we started to
42:29 grow the technical team then so we are
42:31 not on the on like one of these
42:33 companies saying we really soon need
42:36 very much people we want to grow it
42:38 sustainable and we want to see how we
42:40 can develop our resources um as well
42:43 right who are you looking for what kind
42:46 of profiles humanly yeah developers like
42:51 AI but also like backend like fullstack
42:54 there definitely most most important
42:56 thing um and yeah I would say that's
43:01 like the main part full stack and AI so
43:04 data scientist data
43:06 analyst because there is a comment from
43:08 Benjamin I would love to be a part of
43:10 that I'm a data scientist do youire data
43:13 scientists you can definitely send um
43:17 also on the website you will find our
43:19 like I would say info@
43:21 skin.co um you can just um send your CV
43:24 I'm happy to review it
43:27 and the way you spell skin is not the
43:29 usual way right yeah it's true it's SQ i
43:32 n right so you can also drop it to me on
43:36 LinkedIn if you cannot or make it work
43:39 um that's also fine every message is
43:41 reviewed
43:43 there and there's a question and it's
43:47 also related to my question like about
43:49 the size of your company how did you
43:51 convince the investors to F to F to fund
43:55 your project in digital health and what
43:58 were the main
43:59 challenges so the main challenge at
44:02 first was um from technology side so are
44:05 you really able to do that because my
44:07 coone and me both of us were
44:09 non-technical um so they were kind of
44:11 afraid but that was easy to handle so we
44:14 onboarded a great CTO we did the
44:17 technology everyone could test it so
44:19 here was the proof right I mean it was
44:21 not that easy but at the end of the day
44:23 these were the milestones and the second
44:25 thing is that you for us main challenge
44:29 was what I already mentioned like people
44:31 don't really believe that Healthcare
44:32 Solutions can be how to say sustainable
44:35 from business perspective um so that
44:38 they can earn money so for us we
44:40 understood we can use the AI also kind
44:43 of in B2B projects right and that was a
44:46 like a changing point so we made clear
44:48 that we are able to earn money with what
44:51 we do and then it was a much easier um
44:55 discussion I mean so for your latest
44:57 round it was you were already profitable
45:00 so it was easier to convince investors
45:02 that they should give you money honestly
45:04 we had to because after all the crisis
45:07 we had in the world right um the
45:09 investors also changed so the investors
45:12 don't it was not enough for them to just
45:15 see good visions and good papers and
45:17 good slides they also want to see that
45:19 you are able to run a business that you
45:21 can earn money over the last months and
45:24 years that became very important for
45:25 them so I think in nowadays that's one
45:28 of the main things you have to do as
45:30 like company or founder um to really
45:33 prove okay we have the possibility to
45:35 make money not just a good idea and we
45:38 don't need 100 million to get the first
45:40 money we also like have good business
45:43 cases already
45:45 here but honestly that's a tough way
45:49 right because I mean you need to find
45:50 first customers then which are willing
45:52 to pay money even if you're probably not
45:54 ready with everything right but it's an
45:57 operational problem you can definitely
46:00 solve how do you earn money now is it by
46:04 affiliation with something or like
46:06 people need to pay recommendation so we
46:09 integrate our AI to different partners
46:12 right so we do the health checks on
46:14 different point of yeah sales so first
46:17 of all of course in our own application
46:18 skin where is the digital clinic but we
46:21 also have other applications um and
46:24 other Point of Sales where people are
46:25 using our technology so it's more like a
46:29 yeah I would say software as a service
46:30 model um and this is definitely where
46:33 you have better use cases in
46:36 right so if I detect some skin problems
46:39 and then the app recommends me like a
46:41 specific treatment specific cream or
46:45 like something and buy it throughout the
46:47 app then you get a cut right yeah also
46:50 yeah okay and right now you have enough
46:54 money to like
46:56 yeah sorry no I was just want to say but
46:59 of course in health it's more regulated
47:00 so you have to make a difference between
47:02 like lifestyle product like skin care
47:05 and skin Health but I mean that's for
47:08 for now pretty much too much the only
47:10 thing I just want to let the people know
47:12 is that um of course it depends on the
47:15 market the regulation and the software
47:17 you created right but make sure that you
47:20 can show that your technology has the
47:22 potential to earn
47:24 money this is what my dermatologist
47:28 recommended me like I will not show what
47:30 exactly it
47:31 is have to like a
47:34 spray I think they also get in a gut
47:36 like because they like when I go to the
47:38 office the the products they on
47:42 understand right so I'm pretty sure that
47:44 there are some deals because like they
47:46 give also free samples yeah definitely I
47:50 mean they also have to think how to earn
47:52 money right it's also a business there
47:54 yeah yeah exactly
47:56 who was your first
47:58 hire the C like the
48:01 technical um but it was like not
48:04 specific in AI it was really more about
48:06 the full technology thing so I I'm the
48:09 CPO in the company so I needed someone
48:12 who is coding all my ideas and product
48:15 officer right yes CPO okay and then the
48:18 co-founder is CEO I assume yeah I mean
48:21 we we share the positions a little bit
48:23 um but over the years it came that I'm
48:27 more the the product one with the team
48:29 and he's more like on the yeah CEO
48:33 level I know that we only have three
48:36 minutes and this the question I have
48:38 might take more time you have at least
48:41 one kid right how did you even manage to
48:44 like with one kid when especially when
48:47 the kid was growing up to do anything
48:49 let alone like start a successful
48:52 company yeah that was a challenge that
48:55 definitely I mean Co was always also
48:58 there right so he was at home with me um
49:01 but I mean I have a very supportive
49:03 surrounding so honestly I take him to
49:07 the company if needed I take him to
49:10 business meetings if needed he's there
49:12 and he's part of it right so he's there
49:14 from the beginning um so I think it's a
49:17 new generation and a new style of work
49:19 we have of course um you have to be
49:22 concentrated I'm not saying I can do
49:24 everything on the same time but you need
49:26 to be kind of flexible sometimes and um
49:29 for me also it works really good to to
49:32 structure my day like there are hours I
49:34 really just spend with him and there are
49:36 hours I definitely just work right so um
49:39 but it doesn't mean I'm working from 8
49:41 to four it's more flexible in my case
49:44 because I have to pick him up from the
49:45 kindergarten there's no other way right
49:49 so so I'm doing kind of a flexible
49:51 working model but it it works out out
49:53 pretty nice like all our investors know
49:55 him from the beginning he's like like I
49:57 said like if we have investor reporting
49:59 meeting and I have to take him with me
50:01 he's on the side doing his things like
50:03 he knows the whole procedure from the
50:05 beginning um so he's also he's always
50:08 telling me Mommy it's it's our company
50:10 right so he feels like part of it so I
50:13 think if you are relaxed he he or she is
50:16 relaxed so you can handle it but it's
50:18 definitely a balance you have to find
50:21 and you need people around you to like
50:23 take care sometimes and I think the
50:26 hardest part is to not um be upset
50:29 always like not feeling that you cannot
50:31 reach all for the company you cannot
50:33 reach all for him I think if you
50:35 integrate things for you both is part of
50:37 me that's the most important lesson I I
50:40 took
50:42 then I have a son he's seven years old
50:45 and now I can kind of negotiate with him
50:48 okay now like go draw paint something
50:52 I'll have like one hour podcast
50:53 interview and then we will play right
50:55 but when he was like four years old or
50:57 three like I couldn't really do this CU
51:00 like he demanded attention now not
51:02 later yeah so I guess with ag becomes
51:06 easier def as mentioned there's no right
51:08 or wrong right it's more like a
51:11 integrative Journey you spend together
51:13 and I mean being a Founder is a decision
51:15 running your own business is a decision
51:17 for life it's not just a job um so
51:20 definitely everyone is affected and I
51:22 mean that can be tough sometimes but it
51:24 also has has good sides very good sides
51:27 so he for example like I remember last
51:30 time we discussed about kindergarten
51:32 having issues with like new new play
51:35 stuff and so on and my little one just
51:37 said oh Mommy we can open a business and
51:39 sell and buy like products for them so
51:41 they can earn more money to renew the
51:44 classrooms right so what you get out of
51:46 it is that just he got the
51:47 entrepreneurial Spirit from the
51:49 beginning I mean it's not a good thing
51:52 for every child I know that right but
51:54 especially like like what you teach them
51:56 and show them is what their mindset is
51:58 getting through right and so sometimes
52:01 just don't be afraid to like protect
52:03 them too much they can handle a lot of
52:05 things and they are very interested so
52:07 keep them on the journey that worked
52:09 pretty well for me at least so now he'll
52:12 go to school soon and start selling
52:13 wooden stick or something yeah hope
52:17 so yeah now you need to go right so
52:20 thanks a lot for joining us for sharing
52:22 the story I am not keeping you any
52:24 longer so enjoy it the weekend and bye
52:26 everyone yeah see you next time
