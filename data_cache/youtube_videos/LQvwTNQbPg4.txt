2:39 thank you rahu for coming today and it's
2:43 pleasure to have you
2:45 yeah thanks thanks alexis for having me
2:48 yes so before we go into the main topic
2:51 of mentoring um
2:52 uh maybe you could uh you could tell um
2:55 us a bit about your background uh can
2:57 you tell us about your journey so far
3:00 yeah sure so um so i grew up in india in
3:03 different
3:04 parts of northern india and then i
3:07 graduated
3:07 in 99 in mining engineering actually so
3:10 not data mining but
3:12 mining engineering but i think by the
3:14 time i graduated i was kind of not so
3:18 interested in pursuing a career in
3:19 mining
3:20 and i was more i was sort of interested
3:24 in computers
3:26 you know around that time and thankfully
3:28 for me
3:29 there was this i.t boom in the world so
3:33 i kind of
3:34 took the advantage and joined an indian
3:37 i.t services company
3:39 in bangalore in india and i was there
3:41 for about seven years as a java
3:43 programmer
3:44 and i think back then java was uh almost
3:47 like how you have golang
3:49 and rust these days like the cool thing
3:51 to do
3:52 um so i learned a lot um worked on in
3:55 different domains
3:56 as a consulting company uh mostly in
3:58 finance but also other domains um and
4:00 then
4:01 um after spending about seven years
4:03 there
4:04 i moved to singapore and joined credit
4:07 suisse which is an investment bank
4:09 and i think that was uh probably my
4:11 first
4:12 foray into the data world because as an
4:16 investment bank there was
4:17 most of the products and and
4:19 technologies that they were working on
4:20 were all related to data
4:22 even though we didn't really call it big
4:24 data at that time but i was still you
4:25 know i was part of this
4:27 team called market data ingest where i
4:29 was kind of doing etls although i didn't
4:31 know that it was called an etl at that
4:33 time
4:34 and so i spent again about six or seven
4:36 years there
4:38 working initially as a back-end engineer
4:41 and then later as a team leader as well
4:43 um and then um and then i joined
4:46 thoughtworks which is a consulting
4:47 company they have offices all over the
4:49 world
4:50 and i think that they're very very
4:53 popular for
4:54 you know deep engineering skills and
4:56 martin fowler if you're familiar with
4:58 his name
4:58 he's one of the employees and there
5:01 again you know it's a consulting company
5:02 so i worked on different domains but
5:04 again i was kind of very close to data
5:06 around that time
5:07 and then about three years ago i decided
5:09 to move to berlin
5:11 to join homeowner which was called go
5:14 euro at that time
5:15 as i said we are a ticketing company so
5:17 if you are traveling
5:19 anywhere in europe and also in us these
5:21 days
5:22 you can go to our portal and book book
5:24 your tickets
5:26 and then when i joined i was asked to
5:28 lead the bi and data engineering team
5:30 and that's
5:31 that has been somewhat my journey
5:35 so far yeah it's uh
5:38 an interesting experience especially
5:40 starting from mining
5:42 yeah yeah absolutely yeah it's kind of
5:44 crazy because i started with mining
5:46 and i'm kind of doing data mining now so
5:48 it's
5:50 this
5:53 even though now it's not called data
5:56 mining
5:56 anymore now it's data science right and
6:00 um you also you
6:03 like today the topic is mentoring and
6:05 you are also active
6:06 in in this area you mentor people at
6:09 this monitoring club
6:11 and what does mentoring mean to you like
6:14 what is it
6:16 what is this so i think the the
6:19 traditional definition of mentoring is
6:21 is about you know having i think they
6:23 call it a
6:24 partnering relationship with someone who
6:27 maybe knows a little bit more about a
6:29 certain topic than you and so you reach
6:31 out to them
6:32 and build this kind of you know support
6:34 relationship
6:35 um maybe there's some questions that
6:37 you're trying to answer and so on
6:39 but for me i define it a little more
6:42 loosely
6:43 um and and for me the definition is just
6:46 about you know
6:47 reaching out to someone for a different
6:48 perspective um it could be about a
6:51 problem that you're trying to solve some
6:53 challenge or some decision that you're
6:55 trying to make in your career
6:56 and it's just about you know getting
6:58 getting an opinion from someone who may
6:59 have
7:00 who may have a perspective that might be
7:02 interesting for you i think it would be
7:05 that's that's where i would kind of say
7:06 that it's
7:08 that's how i define it and i feel that
7:11 in our industry especially in tech it's
7:13 very important because
7:14 um personally i've seen that um
7:17 you know unlike industries like food or
7:19 retail or law
7:21 um we don't really have a very good
7:23 tradition of apprenticeship
7:25 um where you know you're for the for the
7:27 first few years you're working with
7:28 someone closely they're
7:30 mentoring you guiding you and that's why
7:32 it becomes very important to have
7:34 someone to reach out to when you have
7:35 you know some challenges that you you're
7:37 trying to navigate through
7:39 so as industries for you it doesn't
7:42 necessarily mean like a long-term
7:44 activity it can also be just reaching
7:45 out for advice
7:46 but also can be like something more
7:50 uh how to say like more formal
7:55 like an apprenticeship program at the
7:58 company
7:58 and which lasts for maybe a couple of
8:00 years right yeah it depends so it
8:02 depends on on your needs um i think
8:04 traditionally and
8:05 i also recommend to have a long-term
8:07 mentoring relationship
8:09 but quite often people have like you
8:11 know really small
8:12 very specific questions and it's
8:14 perfectly okay to reach out and and
8:16 to a mentor and and get some advice in
8:18 that area as well so
8:20 it's it's it's not like a very you know
8:21 specific definition it just depends on
8:23 your needs
8:25 it can be let's say i am a java
8:27 developer and i want to go to
8:29 data analysis and then absolutely i
8:31 reach out to somebody asking hey do you
8:32 think this is the right thing
8:34 to me this would be also mentoring
8:37 absolutely and
8:40 was mentoring an important part of your
8:42 career so far
8:44 um well for the first 10 years no
8:48 and that's the crazy thing in fact
8:49 that's probably why i got into mentoring
8:51 because i realized
8:52 this huge gap that i went through
8:56 so for the first 10 years i didn't have
8:57 a mentor really
8:59 i didn't even know what what that meant
9:02 but
9:03 my my foray into mentoring both as a
9:06 mentor as
9:07 and as a mentee started when i joined
9:09 thoughtworks because thoughtworks had a
9:11 very rich culture
9:13 of you know having a sponsor or a mentor
9:16 for every employee and that's how i kind
9:18 of got introduced to this concept and
9:20 that's when i started
9:21 having mentors as well as mentees
9:25 okay and how does it work so basically
9:28 the moment you join
9:29 you get a mentor who stays with you
9:31 throughout
9:32 your entire employment at
9:36 work yes so i i mean they they keep
9:39 experimenting with different formats but
9:41 i think yeah that's typically how it
9:42 works
9:43 um you're you're not always appointed a
9:45 mentor you're encouraged to find one for
9:47 yourself
9:49 but if you can't then the organization
9:51 or the people team
9:52 or someone you know can can help you
9:54 find one for yourself
9:56 and it's typically not someone who's
9:58 from your team
9:59 because the idea is to get mentorship
10:02 from
10:02 from a person who can offer like an
10:05 unbiased
10:06 you know impartial opinion about your
10:08 career and therefore it's advisable to
10:10 seek someone who's
10:11 not your immediate manager for example
10:13 you know someone from a different team
10:15 or something like that yeah
10:18 and if you want to uh
10:21 find a mentor let's say thought works
10:24 it's nice that
10:25 there is such a thing as a mentorship
10:27 program right but
10:29 having such person to talk to and talk
10:32 about
10:33 your problems is very useful especially
10:36 there are there are some things you
10:38 don't want to talk to your manager about
10:40 right so some
10:41 sometimes it's better to ask for an
10:44 opinion uh
10:45 for somebody else like you said from a
10:47 different team
10:48 how how to find such a person do you
10:51 have any ideas
10:52 i think that's probably the most
10:54 difficult part of it all right because
10:57 um you don't know whether the person
11:00 um so first of all you know you're
11:03 trying to seek
11:04 someone who has experience or who can
11:06 offer meaningful actionable advice in
11:08 the area that
11:09 that you're struggling with or you have
11:11 questions around
11:12 um and secondly you're also looking for
11:15 someone who can play that role you know
11:17 just because they have the knowledge
11:18 does not mean
11:19 they can uh also be a good mentor um but
11:22 i think it's an iterative process
11:24 you know uh so so rather than trying to
11:26 kind of spend a lot of time
11:29 initially searching for the right person
11:32 you maybe have to try it out you know
11:34 with with few people so you could ask
11:36 around in your network
11:38 um if if similar to thoughtworks if you
11:41 have
11:42 a formal program in your organization
11:44 you could hook in
11:45 into that or otherwise you know through
11:48 your personal network you typically come
11:50 across somebody
11:51 but i've also seen people uh and you
11:53 know these days we have
11:54 programs like the mentoring club that
11:56 i'm a member of which which have made it
11:57 a lot more easier to find someone
12:00 but otherwise i've even seen people just
12:02 you know
12:03 directly through linkedin reaching out
12:05 to somebody they know or they've heard
12:07 of
12:07 and asking them hey i have these
12:09 questions would you
12:10 have some time to give to me so yeah but
12:13 i think
12:14 as i said it's a it's a process so you
12:16 have to go through a couple of
12:17 iterations before you can find the right
12:18 person
12:20 yeah and uh that's interesting you you
12:23 said
12:24 you suggested that you can just reach
12:25 out to your network and sometimes
12:28 i'm active on linkedin and sometimes i
12:30 have these requests
12:32 like hey can you help me on this thing
12:36 and um yeah i cannot always help like i
12:39 don't always have the
12:41 expertise and sometimes i feel like
12:42 people just send it to everyone
12:45 and in hope that somebody will respond
12:49 but i think maybe there is a better way
12:51 to target
12:52 uh this message to a specific person
12:55 right
12:55 so maybe you have some recommendation
12:57 let's say um if you want to find a
12:59 mentor in your network how do you
13:01 go about finding for finding this person
13:04 i think it's
13:05 it's like building a relationship right
13:07 so yes um
13:08 the cold calls would would be
13:11 you know unpredictable you don't know
13:14 whether the other person has time
13:15 they don't know who you are and
13:17 sometimes you know just investing in
13:19 those
13:20 networks a little bit before you reach
13:22 out to them
13:23 is always better so maybe there's a
13:25 meetup group or like
13:26 the the the data talk slack channel or
13:29 something so you're building
13:30 some some kind of you know you're
13:32 investing in that relationship or that
13:34 network a little bit
13:35 the other person also gets to know you a
13:37 little bit more and that's
13:38 the time that you know you reach out to
13:40 them and ask if they are willing to and
13:42 if they know you already if they've seen
13:44 how you work if they've
13:45 seen you participate then you know they
13:47 may be a little more open to
13:49 to that kind of conversation right um so
13:52 i think yeah i think
13:53 one of the the ways to do that is to
13:55 just build that relationship
13:57 but again i would also say don't be
13:58 don't be afraid of like if you really
14:00 have
14:01 a you know a good reason to reach out to
14:04 somebody
14:05 maybe just dropping them a line an email
14:08 or a note with with specifics would be
14:11 helpful and don't get better
14:12 by a lack of an answer you have to keep
14:15 trying
14:16 yeah and uh yeah so
14:20 this is an interesting topic like how to
14:22 find a mentor and you said sometimes
14:24 like
14:25 what i call maybe sending a cold email
14:29 will still work i do sometimes get such
14:32 emails that are interesting
14:34 i am happy to help people but
14:38 yeah how this email should look like to
14:41 increase the chances of
14:42 response in your opinion like what are
14:45 the emails let's say when you get an
14:47 email
14:48 and you know that you immediately want
14:50 to
14:52 to answer and to help this person versus
14:54 uh
14:55 now okay i don't know if i should spend
14:57 my time trying to figure out what this
14:59 person
14:59 wants and if i want to help is there
15:02 something you can recommend
15:04 absolutely i think um being being a bit
15:06 more specific in your request helps
15:08 so if i put myself in that situation and
15:10 i get a message from someone
15:12 and they say hey can you help me with
15:14 this a little more detail
15:16 around this is who i am this is what i
15:18 am struggling with or this is the
15:20 question i have what do you think
15:22 this is what i have tried so just
15:23 showing that earnestness that
15:25 authenticity
15:26 sometimes speaks volumes versus uh
15:29 a very vague message saying can you help
15:31 me you know
15:32 because i don't know and i don't really
15:33 know if i can really help you or not
15:35 um so maybe just being more specific
15:38 is helpful if you are purely making a
15:40 cold call and and also maybe
15:42 sharing a little bit about your
15:44 background that you know this is what i
15:45 have done
15:46 this is this is how i'm navigating with
15:49 this challenge right now and so on and
15:50 so forth that might also be very helpful
15:54 and um coming back a bit to your
15:57 uh this experience uh
16:00 as a mentee at third works at some point
16:03 i guess you also
16:04 became a mentor yourself right so first
16:07 you were a mentee
16:08 somebody was helping you but you spent
16:10 quite a while there
16:11 so at some point you had enough
16:13 experience to actually mentor somebody
16:16 um what did this do to your career like
16:19 how helpful was it was it helpful at all
16:21 or
16:22 um what were the benefits for you
16:25 as a mentor there's quite a few benefits
16:28 that i have seen um
16:30 in the last few years i mean first first
16:32 and foremost you know just
16:33 just being able to kind of help someone
16:36 out or
16:37 share your experiences is a reward in
16:40 itself
16:41 because it's it's a way of you know
16:43 giving it forward
16:46 i also felt that it it made me uh
16:50 i'm still learning but it made me into a
16:52 better listener
16:53 um because you kind of have to listen
16:58 a lot and have to be good at listening
17:00 um
17:01 i think it's also uh so as a as a team
17:05 lead
17:05 i'm also leading a team so in some sense
17:07 it also gives me a perspective
17:09 about leading a team by myself and what
17:12 that means and you know
17:13 for example if someone comes with a
17:15 problem or challenge then i can relate
17:18 that with my own experiences in my team
17:20 and oh
17:21 am i also doing the same to my my team
17:24 you know
17:25 and so on and so forth and then finally
17:27 it's also given me a good network now so
17:29 being part of this mentoring club
17:32 i'm also part of you know i'm i'm kind
17:34 of
17:35 networking with other people who are
17:37 mentors themselves so that's also
17:40 a reward in a way so basically you can
17:44 help others and this is very rewarding
17:46 and you also get to know their problems
17:48 and how to
17:49 finding the solution to these problems
17:51 is also helpful you know for you to
17:54 uh basically yeah okay
17:58 um and problems i think that's another
18:00 another
18:01 part of the learning which is kind of a
18:03 little subtle but it happens over time
18:04 so what happens is that
18:06 even though five people approach you
18:07 with five different problems but you
18:09 start seeing that oh you know what
18:10 underneath it all it's the imposter
18:12 syndrome
18:14 and then you start getting more
18:15 sensitized to that as a as a kind of a
18:18 more generic problem
18:19 and you start seeing those patterns in
18:21 maybe the way you're leading
18:23 your own team or you're seeing someone
18:25 else lead it
18:26 and that also adds to that learning
18:29 and if somebody reaches out to you and
18:32 asks for help on a topic where you don't
18:35 have experience what do you usually do
18:37 in this case
18:39 um i think it's it's it's very uh simple
18:42 you just say that you don't know you
18:43 can't
18:44 help in that area because you don't have
18:45 much experience and you then try and
18:48 connect them to somebody you know who
18:50 might be able to help i think it's it's
18:51 just about that
18:54 yeah the maybe
18:57 have you been in a situation where you
19:00 didn't know
19:01 like how to solve a problem but just by
19:03 listening to somebody to
19:05 listen by listening to their problem and
19:07 then uh
19:08 you know asking questions uh you were
19:10 able to help them
19:12 yeah so that's something that i always
19:14 try to do right so
19:16 um and quite quite often it happens um
19:19 that someone would reach out to me from
19:22 i don't know their
19:24 they have experience in marketing
19:25 they're not necessarily from
19:27 the same um you know like tech
19:30 but marketing or i had someone reach out
19:34 to me from the construction industry
19:36 um and initially it felt like
19:40 there isn't much of an overlap between
19:42 my own experiences and theirs
19:44 so i wasn't sure how i would be able to
19:46 help but then first and foremost you
19:48 know
19:48 giving a listening ear to somebody
19:50 itself is part of mentorship because
19:52 sometimes
19:53 just by that day they would be able to
19:55 solve their own problems
19:57 and then secondly as i said earlier you
20:00 can recognize common patterns so even if
20:02 they come from
20:03 a different background some of these
20:06 social kind of problems that one sees in
20:09 in a workplace are very common
20:10 and that's when you can relate and say
20:12 hey i don't know exactly how it works in
20:14 your environment
20:15 but this is something this is sounding
20:17 similar to what i have seen and here's
20:18 what i have done when i had a
20:20 challenge similar to yours and and
20:23 that's how you try and
20:24 you know start trying to find these dots
20:27 that can connect these two worlds
20:28 together
20:29 that's pretty interesting so these
20:31 people from construction industry
20:34 or from like some other industry
20:36 industries
20:37 they found you through this mentoring
20:39 club yes
20:41 um yeah maybe you can tell us a bit more
20:44 about this club
20:45 what is this
20:51 that was started earlier this year by a
20:54 few of my
20:55 colleagues ex-colleagues now um
20:58 in berlin and i think the the the um
21:02 the motivation was simple we just wanted
21:05 to reach out to people
21:06 who had a need for some kind of career
21:10 mentorship
21:10 mentoring or coaching and so this is a
21:13 club um
21:14 call it a club it's a group of people
21:16 who have grown to almost 300 people now
21:18 300 mentors
21:20 and i don't have the exact numbers but i
21:22 think we've um we've mentored or we've
21:24 given close to a thousand sessions if
21:26 not more
21:28 it's a it's completely free of cost um
21:30 so all you have to do is book
21:32 um a session with one of the mentors
21:35 that's available on the club and and
21:38 that's about it you know and
21:39 then it's just between you and the
21:41 mentor the mentors come from
21:43 all different walks of life a lot of the
21:46 folks there are like cxos in different
21:48 companies around
21:49 europe um as well as outside
21:52 there's people from product from tech
21:54 from marketing sales
21:56 design entrepreneurs
22:00 so there's lots of people from different
22:01 different walks of life
22:04 and which topics do you help with on
22:07 this platform
22:08 i personally help with things like you
22:11 know career
22:12 navigation um so it could be something
22:15 like as
22:15 i said earlier some challenges that
22:17 you're facing at your workplace
22:19 there's some career related decisions
22:21 that you're trying to make maybe
22:22 trying to switch a career or you've just
22:25 graduated and trying to figure out
22:27 whether you should go for higher
22:28 education
22:28 or not i also sometimes talk to people
22:32 about more technical topics so my
22:34 background or my recent background is in
22:36 data engineering
22:37 so there are times when people approach
22:40 me about you know what's your data stack
22:42 or what should be an ideal stack for a
22:44 for a startup and so on so it varies
22:47 between these yeah yeah and
22:50 if someone if somebody is looking for
22:53 advice
22:54 and somebody who wants to to reach out
22:56 to you
22:57 um through this mentoring club um what
23:00 should they do to
23:01 best prepare for this uh for this
23:04 mentoring session like how to guest
23:06 to get the most out of this session so
23:09 um
23:09 it kind of depends on what exactly are
23:12 you looking for
23:13 i mean um initially so but let's let's
23:16 uh let's take a common example right so
23:20 let's say that you have some specific
23:21 challenges that you're trying to
23:22 navigate through
23:24 i think it helps to um to reach out to
23:27 your mentor first
23:28 um and give them as much details as
23:31 possible
23:32 about about your background and what is
23:34 it that you're looking for
23:36 um but i think it also helps to do a bit
23:39 of introspection to see what is it that
23:40 you're trying to get out of the
23:42 mentoring
23:43 relationship or a session is it a
23:45 one-off thing that you're trying to
23:47 bounce some ideas
23:47 are you looking for some validation
23:49 about a decision that you've recently
23:50 taken
23:52 or are you looking for a more long-term
23:54 engagement
23:55 you know so it's good to ask those kind
23:57 of questions first
23:59 um i would say also that you know don't
24:02 over prepare it's not a job interview
24:04 because sometimes
24:05 uh let the conversation flow so book
24:08 some time get get a basic idea
24:10 share these details with your mentor and
24:12 then let the conversation flow
24:14 um one of the mistakes not a mistake but
24:18 one of the misconceptions i've seen
24:19 uh with people who come from entering
24:21 sessions is that they expect
24:23 you know a very kind of specific answer
24:25 to a problem and and
24:27 they're often disappointed maybe when
24:29 they see that there's no
24:30 real specific answers to most questions
24:32 right a mental job is more about
24:36 showing you giving you some pointers or
24:38 kind of
24:40 you know planting a seed in your brain
24:42 in a way um
24:43 asking you to probe something deeper and
24:45 so on so it's a process and just
24:47 just being aware of that before you get
24:49 into the mentoring session itself
24:51 so that you know that you you're not
24:53 you're not disappointed by the end of it
24:58 if you can share uh if it's possible
25:01 maybe not something personal but uh from
25:03 one out
25:05 from one of the recent sessions that you
25:07 had uh what kind of problem
25:09 um you were approached with like maybe
25:12 there is something super
25:14 common that comes up absolutely
25:17 so there's uh there's a few common areas
25:20 imposter syndrome is the biggest most i
25:22 would say
25:23 more than 50 60 percent of the people
25:25 who reach out to me
25:27 are suffering from some kind of an
25:28 imposter syndrome they feel they're not
25:30 good enough
25:31 in whatever they're doing that's very
25:33 common
25:34 i also get a lot of questions about
25:38 tech versus management and this
25:40 typically happens with people who
25:42 spend their initial five or six years in
25:43 technology and are now
25:45 either by themselves or uh by their
25:48 organization being asked to take more
25:50 leadership roles
25:51 and they they feel oh you know is it a
25:54 is it a big choice that i have to make
25:56 like if i do people management i can't
25:57 do tech and vice versa
25:59 so this is very common um then there's
26:02 uh
26:02 you know um career moves should i join
26:05 this company
26:06 should i um you know
26:10 should i go for higher education and
26:12 those kind of questions as well
26:15 yeah that's interesting um like if
26:17 somebody
26:18 comes to you and says or describes a
26:22 problem and you understand okay this
26:23 person
26:24 has this imposter in cinder imposter
26:27 syndrome
26:27 what do you usually recommend in this
26:29 case there's no one answer to it
26:32 because it depends um because imposter
26:34 syndrome can
26:35 can happen for various reasons so the
26:38 process that i
26:39 usually have is to go a bit deeper
26:43 into what's the root cause behind it
26:46 right and
26:47 more often than not this is more of a
26:49 perception or a myth
26:50 that gets built up because of um mostly
26:53 external factors but sometimes internals
26:55 are internal as well
26:57 so the process is just to you know
26:58 scratch the surface go a bit deeper and
27:00 question some of those beliefs
27:03 um and then you know try and try and uh
27:06 and see
27:06 what are the you know get to a
27:09 place where you are able to define that
27:11 more specifically
27:13 you say oh i don't feel good enough i
27:14 don't feel i'm fit for
27:16 working in this team what does that mean
27:18 so i would say
27:19 i can't give you a specific
27:20 recommendation to a question but
27:23 i think it all depends on just going
27:25 down that process
27:26 and trying to understand the root cause
27:28 behind the problems
27:30 and that your answer makes me wonder
27:34 like it seems like to be a good mentor
27:36 you really need to understand
27:37 people to to go deep and find this root
27:41 cause and understand okay
27:43 uh this is actually like the the real
27:45 problem is this imposter
27:47 imposter syndrome um how do you learn
27:50 that
27:51 like as a tech person because uh let's
27:53 say we we're usually
27:55 like you as a java developer previously
27:57 i'm i was also a java developer we used
27:59 to
28:00 talking to computers right writing code
28:02 how do we go
28:04 from uh writing code to actually
28:06 understanding people and being
28:08 a good mentor or maybe it's not for
28:09 everyone
28:12 um i think well
28:15 i guess yeah i think you need to have a
28:17 little bit of an
28:19 of a natural inclination and helping
28:21 people but i would also argue that most
28:23 people have that
28:24 right and as we grow um so yes for the
28:26 first
28:27 couple of years of your career maybe
28:28 you're you're spending
28:30 most of your energies as an individual
28:32 contributor but in most
28:34 work environments you're always um
28:37 you know helping someone out maybe
28:40 there's a new person who joined your
28:41 team
28:41 and you're helping them with onboarding
28:43 right so there's always that
28:45 that that aspect of it's just you know
28:48 even tech programming or data is still a
28:50 social activity you're still working in
28:52 teams
28:53 and therefore um you do
28:56 even inadvertently acquire a lot of
28:58 these people's skills
29:00 even if you don't believe that yourself
29:02 you do have
29:03 always a personal you know way of
29:05 helping other people right
29:07 and it's just about honing that and
29:09 bringing that to the table when you are
29:11 acting as a mentor and then there are
29:13 certain aspects which
29:15 which you learn kind of you know tricks
29:17 of the trade uh so to speak which you
29:19 learn as you go
29:20 like you know being a better listener or
29:23 not jumping like one of my colleagues
29:26 from the mentoring club calls it
29:28 the advice monster you know uh so not
29:31 immediately jumping into
29:33 giving advice but listening to what what
29:35 the other person is trying to say
29:37 i think it's it's just about as you said
29:39 it's a skill it comes with practice
29:41 um but i'm sure if you look deeper you
29:44 you're already doing
29:46 that uh in in many ways in your current
29:49 workplace already right so it's just
29:50 about taking that to the next level
29:53 so basically do not be afraid of trying
29:56 it's not as
29:57 difficult as it sounds right no not at
30:00 all and and it's
30:01 you know it's um it's a very rewarding
30:04 exercise i would say
30:05 and there's nothing wrong in helping
30:08 other people out it's not about sitting
30:10 on a higher pedestal or
30:12 oh i have so much knowledge that i'm
30:13 going to give it to you it's just really
30:15 about giving them a listening
30:17 and xenia is asking what are the main
30:20 motivations
30:21 for a mentor to mentor someone we i
30:24 think we touched
30:25 on this topic a bit so you said like uh
30:27 it helps you personally uh like you you
30:30 start seeing patterns you
30:31 become a better listener and that it's
30:34 also rewarding for you when somebody
30:36 like when you have this feeling of
30:38 helping someone out
30:40 is there something else that uh that is
30:42 helpful
30:43 no i i mean personally for me it was as
30:46 i said earlier
30:47 for the first 10 years i had no one to
30:49 work i did not know what i was doing so
30:52 i
30:52 came from a mining background there were
30:55 no engineers in or you know people in
30:57 software in my family that i could talk
30:59 to
31:00 and there was no culture of
31:01 apprenticeship or you know mentorship in
31:04 the first few years of my career and i
31:06 struggled a lot i didn't know
31:08 was java the best thing for me you know
31:10 or whatever
31:12 and imposter syndrome for example i i i
31:15 went through that
31:16 for many years so for my personality for
31:18 me the motivation came from that
31:20 from from this fact that since i didn't
31:22 have one can i provide that space to
31:24 other people around me
31:26 so maybe you know so so you need to find
31:28 your own motivation but these are some
31:29 of the things that motivated me
31:32 and you said that through this club
31:35 through this mentoring club
31:37 some people just want to have like a
31:39 one-time
31:40 conversation but maybe sometimes
31:43 i'm not sure if i got it right but
31:46 sometimes people need something more
31:47 long-term right um how often like what's
31:51 the like how often do you have somebody
31:54 who wants to have
31:55 something more long-term long-term is a
31:58 little
31:58 tricky honestly because um first of all
32:02 so i have a few people who i'm mentoring
32:04 long term some of these are
32:06 people i was mentoring at thoughtworks
32:08 when i was working there and also
32:10 through the mentoring club
32:11 i think one thing that you have to keep
32:12 in mind is that long term is
32:14 um so you need to
32:18 to also be mindful of the time
32:19 investment that the mentor is putting
32:21 into this right
32:22 and sometimes these relationships could
32:25 also
32:27 mean uh some kind of a monetary aspect
32:30 to it so there are mentors who do it
32:32 more professionally
32:33 um so one time mentoring is fine but if
32:36 you're trying to
32:37 to to build a more long-term
32:38 relationship then maybe there's like um
32:41 you know a fee that you need to pay to
32:42 them or something like that
32:44 um but yeah but other than that it's
32:47 just about
32:48 um you know establishing that that kind
32:50 of a contract
32:52 between you and the mentor and if they
32:54 are interested and willing to
32:56 provide that to you then then surely go
32:58 for it i would recommend to do
33:00 long-term mentorship because
33:03 it's difficult to understand the entire
33:06 context
33:07 and background in one conversation
33:10 it's always useful to you know um get to
33:14 know
33:14 each other a little bit more over time
33:16 and then you you
33:18 really get more productive with the
33:20 mental
33:21 mentoring process i guess
33:24 it makes more sense to find somebody in
33:27 your company
33:28 in your work workplace for this kind of
33:31 relationships right for a long term
33:33 mentorship relationship right not
33:36 necessarily if your
33:38 organization has either a formal program
33:41 or informally you know somebody you can
33:42 reach out to
33:43 i think that works out wonders so yeah
33:48 mariam is asking um how do you set
33:50 boundaries for long-term
33:52 mentorship relationships like uh of
33:54 course
33:55 uh like you as a mentor you also
33:58 you have other things right you cannot
34:00 uh spend all your time
34:02 helping your mentees and there are
34:04 perhaps other things so how do you set
34:06 up how do you set these boundaries
34:09 yeah and that's really good as i said
34:11 earlier right so um
34:12 and sometimes it's more meaningful
34:15 to have a paid relationship in those
34:18 aspects because you know
34:20 then both parties are more committed to
34:22 it and and it's easier to create those
34:24 boundaries and expectations
34:26 versus uh just a regular long-term
34:28 mentorship because then you don't know
34:30 what to expect from each other
34:32 um if if that was the question around
34:34 boundaries if i understood that question
34:36 correctly
34:36 yeah i think this is how i understood as
34:38 well um
34:40 yeah thank you and sometimes you know
34:42 it's also about like i have
34:43 i have a couple of people i mentor long
34:45 term and it's it's it's also about
34:49 telling them look it it's not meaningful
34:52 to have
34:53 a next conversation unless there is a
34:55 change in a situation you know
34:57 and and it's not just about meeting
34:59 every week and talking about things if
35:01 it's not if
35:02 you want to point it it starts showing
35:03 diminishing returns
35:05 so just setting those expectations also
35:07 clearly often helps in one question
35:09 like as a mentor sometimes if someone
35:11 reaches out for for regular mentorship i
35:13 say do you really want to talk to me
35:14 because
35:15 is there anything different that we
35:17 would talk about versus what we spoke
35:19 about
35:19 a month ago and if the answer is no then
35:21 maybe
35:22 there is a there's no point in the
35:24 discussion
35:25 it's so basically
35:29 being mindful uh like from both sides
35:32 and
35:32 asking hey do you really think we should
35:34 have this would be beneficial for
35:36 for you to have this uh extra session
35:41 okay um yeah so
35:45 ruslan is asking what do you think about
35:46 paid mentoring i think you
35:48 already covered that yeah
35:52 um is there any um like
35:56 is is it a beneficial relationship for
35:59 mean tea when mentoring is not
36:01 on a free basis but rather when it costs
36:03 money
36:05 i think absolutely so it's um
36:08 it can be more constructive it can be
36:10 more you know you can set the
36:12 expectations better
36:14 um and you know it's kind of like paying
36:18 for
36:18 for a gym membership in a way right so
36:20 if it's working for you
36:22 um then it's and and i think what i've
36:24 seen with paid um
36:26 paid kind of contracts is that there's
36:28 uh
36:30 there's more accountability you know so
36:31 if you're showing up um
36:33 you know exactly what you're looking for
36:34 so there's there's more motivation from
36:36 both sides to
36:37 to to work on that relationship
36:40 yeah but it's a it's not a it's not it's
36:42 not very common
36:43 from what i have seen uh unless i think
36:46 it's very common for like senior leaders
36:48 like cxos
36:49 um but for um
36:52 when you're beginning your career i've
36:54 not seen a lot of uh these kind of paid
36:56 relation
36:56 paid mentorship programs um being
36:59 offered
37:00 you know maybe not in terms of a year
37:02 but i saw a couple
37:04 like in terms of technologies in terms
37:06 of uh like how to find a job
37:08 these kind of things basically
37:11 helping prepare people for a job
37:13 interview
37:15 so this is maybe more common for
37:18 for people with less experience
37:21 yeah so it's like you know anything that
37:23 you pay for right so um
37:25 it's like a training sometimes so as
37:27 long as you believe
37:28 that you'll get something out of it and
37:30 you feel that it's priced
37:32 rightly then then certainly it's it's
37:38 is asking um what would you recommend
37:40 for a minty
37:41 on how to build a two-way connection
37:44 with a mentor
37:46 not just question answering but
37:48 something more engaging
37:50 um so it's like any other relationship
37:52 right so it takes time
37:53 um so you you need to start investing in
37:56 that
37:58 be authentic in in what you're sharing
38:01 it's not as a job interview or it's not
38:03 like you know putting only your best
38:05 foot forward it's
38:06 really about discussing what are your
38:08 challenge areas what are your strengths
38:10 what are your weaknesses
38:11 and also you know uh and i think i've
38:13 written a blog post about this as well
38:15 um kind of working with your mentor
38:17 together over time so even
38:19 conducting a retrospective if needed
38:20 after a while and saying this is working
38:22 this is not working
38:24 can you give me more um i don't know can
38:26 you share some books with me that i can
38:28 read or
38:28 whatever works for you right so be
38:30 making it work for yourself it takes
38:32 time
38:33 and investment and you should invest
38:35 that
38:36 yeah and uh we should share this block
38:39 uh
38:40 in the comments after we finish
38:43 yeah i will be shared
38:46 and quite a few people ask how to
38:49 join this mentoring club so we will
38:51 definitely put links
38:54 in slack and also in the comments to the
38:56 video
38:57 later as
39:01 if you want to just be a mentee then
39:03 what you need to do is go to the website
39:05 and then search for a mentor and book
39:08 some time with them so each of each of
39:10 us has
39:11 a calendly link so you can just go there
39:14 and and see when we are free and book a
39:17 slot
39:18 but if you want to join as a mentor then
39:20 i think the website has
39:21 a page which um which has an enrollment
39:24 form
39:25 i don't know the exact process right now
39:27 but you basically answer a few questions
39:30 and then um bastian and jess who who
39:32 lead this project they'll review your
39:34 application
39:35 and and then they'll you know allow you
39:37 in
39:39 yes thank you um
39:43 and as a somebody who has quite a lot of
39:47 experience being
39:48 a mentor how do you usually like is
39:52 there
39:52 a difference between a mentoring
39:54 somebody who doesn't have a lot of
39:56 experience like a junior and somebody
39:58 who is more experienced is
40:00 is there any difference in mentoring
40:02 these
40:03 groups of people i no i don't think so i
40:07 think it's um
40:10 it's just about what kind of challenges
40:13 they're going through
40:14 and if you have something meaningful to
40:16 add to that
40:17 to be honest so i haven't really seen a
40:19 lot of difference
40:21 um between mentoring um a very junior
40:25 person versus someone with more
40:26 experience it's just the problem space
40:28 sometimes
40:29 differs so yeah i i don't think this
40:34 yeah maybe also seniors maybe they have
40:38 something more concrete or
40:39 it doesn't really happen there is no
40:40 difference no it doesn't and you know
40:42 in a way it's kind of um an interesting
40:45 lesson because
40:46 no matter who you're talking to in their
40:49 problem space there as
40:51 you know they're struggling as much as
40:52 the junior person in their problems
40:55 the the worlds might vary but the the
40:57 extent or the nature
40:58 of of how they're dealing with it
41:01 doesn't
41:01 doesn't very much
41:05 and as a manager do you think a manager
41:09 should be a mentor or
41:11 you know maybe a mentor should be it's
41:13 better if like there is
41:15 a special role of a mentor who is not a
41:17 manager
41:19 yeah so um so most managers these days
41:23 have
41:23 like you know one-on-ones with their uh
41:25 their teammate
41:27 in some sense it's kind of like
41:28 mentorship but the relationship is
41:30 much different because there's uh you
41:33 know there's deliver it's more delivery
41:35 focused sometimes and so on of course
41:36 there's a
41:37 there's a there's a career development
41:39 aspect to it
41:40 but i would say as a mentee or as
41:42 someone who's seeking a mentor
41:44 it's advisable to seek someone who
41:48 is not your immediate manager because
41:50 they can give you a much more
41:52 unbiased opinion you know they they can
41:55 tell you
41:56 you know quit this job it's not working
41:58 for you a manager would probably never
42:00 tell you that right
42:02 so so that's why it's useful and also on
42:04 that note i think it's
42:06 we keep talking about one mentor but you
42:08 don't have to have just one mentor
42:10 you can have multiple depending on
42:13 different areas because not everyone
42:14 would know like
42:15 you know if you're a woman or a
42:17 non-binary person
42:19 it probably helps to also have someone
42:21 from that same group
42:22 because they would understand the
42:24 challenges much better than
42:26 than than maybe someone who's a man or
42:29 you know
42:30 so so i think it's it's it also depends
42:32 on
42:33 having different people for different
42:35 aspects of your
42:36 your career that you're navigating to i
42:39 think there is an article from harvard
42:41 business review like you don't need
42:43 just one mentor you need like a personal
42:46 board of directors
42:47 something like this like basically like
42:50 you don't have to just talk to with the
42:53 same person about all the problems
42:56 it's a good idea to have five or six
42:58 people who
42:59 you reach out to and of course then like
43:02 everyone will have their own uh
43:04 opinion about the thing and then you
43:06 basically need to to make this decision
43:08 yourself at the end
43:10 yeah yeah and that that you you said it
43:12 well that is the key
43:14 because a mentor is the real role of a
43:16 mentor is to show you that direction
43:18 right um not to take your decision so
43:20 you still need to you
43:22 and it's perfectly okay to disagree with
43:24 your mentor as well
43:25 right it's just about getting their
43:26 opinion but the decisions are still
43:28 yours so
43:30 you still need to get invested more in
43:32 in that decision-making process
43:35 and we already talked about like for
43:38 people who want
43:39 to start being a mentor you said if they
43:41 want to do it through the mentoring club
43:43 there is a certain process
43:44 and they should talk to the founding
43:46 members right
43:47 but in general if somebody just wants to
43:50 start
43:50 being a mentor whether with the
43:53 monitoring club or
43:55 some other platform or maybe just by
43:57 themselves
43:58 what should they do how can they start
44:02 from a process perspective it's just
44:03 about you know reaching out to your
44:05 network
44:06 um don't give unsolicited advice to
44:08 people who don't need advice i think
44:09 that's
44:10 one thing to be mindful of so don't just
44:13 go
44:13 tapping everyone on the shoulder and say
44:15 hey we should be doing things
44:16 differently because i want to be a
44:18 mentor
44:19 having said that i think you know just
44:21 reach out and and offer this
44:23 as an option to people and say in your
44:25 network and say you know um
44:27 i i am here if you need to discuss
44:30 something
44:31 that's how i started um
44:34 and yes if you're if you really want to
44:37 do it more formally then you can
44:38 certainly join a club like mentoring
44:40 club there are many others by the way
44:42 i think there's plato and there's a few
44:44 others um
44:45 so that's one way to get into it um and
44:48 in terms of just
44:50 just you know acquiring the skills of
44:52 preparing yourself it's as i said
44:53 earlier it's about
44:54 you know um having that empathy to
44:58 to help um not always
45:01 giving advice but listening um people's
45:05 peoples and you know environment of
45:07 context may be very different from yours
45:09 so so just be mindful of these these
45:11 aspects when you're talking to them
45:15 and i know some people
45:18 think of mentoring as a way to
45:21 have say a side income to start earning
45:25 extra money
45:26 by sharing uh the experience um
45:29 what what do you think about this uh
45:32 i don't know if it's like the real
45:33 motivation i'm not sure if it's money or
45:35 desire to help
45:36 but in your opinion uh when
45:40 sometimes mentorship becomes more like a
45:42 consultancy service
45:44 and i think ruslan is also asking a
45:46 similar question
45:48 um when you just go or pay some money to
45:51 get an answer
45:52 um do you think it's a valuable thing
45:55 for
45:56 for both parties yeah as i said earlier
45:59 i think so
46:00 i think if you have some value to add
46:02 right um
46:03 there's no there's nothing wrong in
46:04 asking charging money for that
46:07 it's like how you would take a you know
46:08 give a training in i don't know
46:10 data science or data engineering it's
46:12 kind of similar to that
46:14 it also has helps establish better
46:17 expectations
46:19 uh and boundaries around the the
46:21 contract so there's nothing wrong with
46:23 it with pursuing that as a
46:25 as a you know a side business or even a
46:28 career because there are
46:30 there are people who are pursuing this
46:32 um you know as a full-time
46:34 career option as well and there's
46:35 nothing wrong with it if you can bring
46:36 that value and people
46:38 people get benefited from that
46:42 yeah i know some people started this as
46:44 a side business
46:46 um but then they got a lot of mentees
46:48 there that they eventually quit their
46:50 job and started to focus
46:52 on this thing called mentoring i'm also
46:55 curious about i
46:56 i'm just curious about your opinion when
46:58 things like that happen
47:00 uh when somebody is a hands-on let's say
47:02 a developer
47:04 creating a lot of code but then at some
47:06 point they
47:07 become a mentor they start
47:10 it also happens in the workplace uh when
47:12 people uh
47:15 how to put it like that when they uh get
47:17 promotions and
47:18 uh like let's say from senior to higher
47:21 levels
47:22 they start mentoring more but they start
47:26 coding less and the fear
47:29 that many people have is they become
47:32 how to say less relevant they start
47:34 losing these skills
47:35 they get new skills but they maybe
47:39 become less hands-on is it something to
47:42 be afraid of like is it uh
47:45 is it maybe just impossible syndrome
47:47 again that kicks in
47:49 and um it's
47:52 it's fine or what do you think about
47:54 this
47:56 yeah i mean and i get this this question
47:58 um a lot
48:00 um especially when you're kind of you
48:02 know growing outside that
48:03 that initial few years of individual
48:05 contribution typically the expectation
48:07 is for you to
48:09 to to get into more quote unquote people
48:11 management
48:12 right and mentoring could be part of
48:14 that um
48:16 and my answer is uh first of all i think
48:20 whether you're so you it's very rare for
48:23 you to be doing
48:24 individual contribution sitting in a
48:27 corner uh
48:28 for the rest of your life so even if
48:29 you're not formally accepting those
48:31 roles
48:32 you're still um you know just by the
48:34 virtue of the
48:36 experience that you acquired you are
48:38 helping other people out and you are
48:39 kind of you know
48:40 doing people management you know
48:42 mentoring junior people and so on so
48:44 there's nothing wrong with that
48:45 um and also first for for some reason
48:48 there is this myth
48:50 in our industry that you you have to
48:52 pick one over the other so you can
48:54 either become
48:55 a people manager or a mentor
48:59 right or you can be stay close to tech
49:02 and programming and data science and
49:04 data engineering
49:06 but if you if you look closely and
49:08 especially in the last few years these
49:09 two worlds are really converging
49:11 together
49:12 there's a lot of people and me included
49:14 for example so i write code every day
49:16 almost
49:17 and at the same time i'm leading the
49:19 team and i'm also you know
49:21 doing stakeholder management and i'm
49:22 also participating in
49:24 architecture deep dives and it's very
49:26 it's not that difficult
49:28 for you to to define how your own day
49:31 should look like
49:32 and you can you know pick and choose
49:35 your own percentage of
49:37 programming time and versus people
49:40 management time and so on
49:42 and in most companies that's that's
49:44 that's
49:45 not very difficult to do um so i'd say
49:48 um it's it's definitely
49:52 a myth that if i do this then i'll not
49:56 be able to do that
49:57 it's all in your hands how you strike
49:59 that balance in most places
50:01 i mean i have more experience working in
50:03 corporates and organizations but i'm
50:04 sure even as freelancers or
50:06 or people running their own companies
50:08 it's kind of
50:10 something that can be managed yeah so
50:12 basically take control of your time
50:14 otherwise somebody else will will do
50:17 that right
50:18 yeah yeah exactly um and it's it's not
50:20 that difficult to do in my opinion
50:23 so is there anything simple you
50:26 you can suggest like to do to start
50:29 doing to
50:30 like i'm surprised that you said you
50:32 still have
50:33 like even though you're a manager and
50:36 you're
50:37 leading a couple of units you still find
50:40 time to
50:41 program so how do you do that and is
50:43 there any advice you can give for
50:45 somebody else who also want to who's in
50:48 a similar position and want to still
50:49 keep coding
50:51 there's no one answer to this i think
50:53 start with accepting that you can
50:55 manage your time better it's not like
50:58 you have to pick one path there's no
51:01 truth in that
51:02 so so the day i committed to myself that
51:05 i'm going to be
51:06 i have to figure some some way out but
51:08 i'm going to be
51:09 uh spending time working with my team
51:11 but i also want to write code
51:13 it all you know i figured this out
51:15 myself right um
51:17 and i think what happens is that a lot
51:19 of us are not taking that first step
51:22 of of of um accepting
51:25 that as a as a viable option once you do
51:28 that then you can figure this out by
51:29 yourself
51:30 in my case um i over time
51:34 and yes i mean it varies so it's not
51:35 like every day
51:37 there's 20 percent coding time and
51:38 there's 20 something else it varies
51:41 but then over time i also delegated more
51:44 to my team
51:44 and that then makes it possible for me
51:47 to
51:48 take out some time to write some code if
51:50 i want to because my team can take care
51:52 of certain things that i would have
51:53 otherwise had to take care of
51:55 and so on and so forth right so i guess
51:56 the short answer is you can figure that
51:58 out
51:58 but step one is to say there is nothing
52:01 wrong in me having this
52:02 this nice blend of
52:06 and management and i'm going to make
52:07 that work for myself okay
52:09 yeah thank you um so there's also a
52:12 question from sejal
52:14 how can uh one work out a personal
52:16 development plan with your manager
52:18 and i think here we can also replace
52:20 manager with a mentor it doesn't have to
52:22 be
52:22 a manager it doesn't always have to be a
52:25 at work right you can also have a
52:27 personal development plan
52:28 outside of work do you have any
52:30 recommendations how one can do that
52:33 um again it depends on what
52:37 objectives you have in mind and i'm not
52:39 very prescriptive about
52:40 you know a format or this plan is better
52:42 than the other what i would say though
52:44 and where i have seen things fail
52:47 is it's very easy to create a plan but
52:50 it's very difficult to
52:51 you know look at it every day and that's
52:53 where most of us fail
52:55 and and what i would advise is
52:58 if you're working with your mentor or
53:00 your manager look at that plan together
53:03 with them you know every week in your
53:05 one-on-one or once every month
53:07 keep it printed and in front of you or
53:10 wherever right that's when we lose sight
53:12 because
53:12 we all create plans um the manager comes
53:15 in
53:16 some day or you go to them and say hey
53:18 let's create this nice plan i'm gonna do
53:20 this and this and this
53:21 and then that gets forgotten after the
53:23 week right
53:25 and and so the struggle or
53:28 the hard work is in making sure that
53:30 you're always looking at it you're
53:32 evolving it
53:33 and you're working on it um the format
53:36 of what
53:37 one plan is better than the other i mean
53:38 those things it all depends on your
53:40 needs
53:41 which reminds me of this new year
53:43 resolution
53:44 that we do every year at the beginning
53:47 and then
53:48 that's the only time when we at least me
53:51 look at this resolution and then
53:53 throughout the rest of the year it's
53:54 like just sitting there and
53:57 collecting dust and then at the end of
53:58 the year when i create a new resolution
54:01 oh finally i wanted to do that thing
54:04 yeah
54:05 they say that practice and process
54:09 are more important than planning and
54:11 that's really true about your career as
54:12 well
54:14 um yeah so i think we can take one last
54:18 question
54:18 and the question is what do you do when
54:22 you
54:22 are overwhelmed by something
54:26 [Music]
54:28 what do i do when i'm overwhelmed well
54:32 i want to say i take a break you know
54:38 worry so much about and you know cut
54:39 down the the less important stuff and so
54:42 on
54:42 i don't do a great job at it to be
54:44 honest i don't want to lie
54:46 but i think yeah i think it's about um
54:48 it's it's about
54:51 i guess understanding that overwhelm is
54:54 also a state of mind
54:55 uh it's some it's a mental construct and
54:58 and then
54:59 trying to figure out what is it that
55:02 overwhelms you because again
55:03 overwhelming the feeling of overwhelm is
55:06 a very
55:07 kind of high level general feeling but
55:10 you need to go
55:11 deeper uh is it because of a fear
55:14 of something that i'm feeling
55:15 overwhelmed but maybe i don't know
55:17 i have a meeting with my ceo and i'm
55:20 scared about that or is it that um
55:24 there's a lot of work that is
55:25 overwhelming me or their decisions to be
55:27 made
55:28 and then you know going going kind of
55:30 one level down into that
55:32 and then trying to to to kind of split
55:36 that apart
55:37 into pieces and that's how i usually try
55:39 and
55:40 navigate i don't do a great job at it i
55:42 want to mention once again
55:46 and there is a question also what are
55:48 some examples of uh
55:49 value you gained from being a mentor you
55:52 answered that
55:53 already but uh i can already see that
55:56 like when you get a question like that
55:58 what do you do when you're overwhelmed
56:00 you sort of already have an answer to
56:01 that you you
56:03 because somebody previously asked you
56:06 about this thing right and you've uh
56:09 already probably
56:10 went through this like okay what
56:13 should i do in this case and when this
56:16 question comes up again
56:17 you're not completely unprepared right
56:19 that is true yeah i mean
56:20 it definitely compels you to think about
56:22 how you've navigated this is the
56:24 situations in the past so how would you
56:26 do them
56:27 in the future it definitely makes you
56:29 more more empathetic towards other other
56:31 folks
56:33 and you know um are you still there you
56:38 frozen huh you're back yes i
56:41 quickly wanted to add as you know this
56:44 year has
56:44 been rather difficult for most of us and
56:48 um so that's another
56:51 another kind of motivating factor to
56:54 to be able to connect with people from
56:56 like different parts of the world
56:59 and i got calls from folks in australia
57:02 in india and in many other places where
57:04 they someone lost their job and they
57:07 just wanted
57:07 to talk to somebody you know and and
57:09 that was personally very
57:11 kind of nice to be able to
57:14 talk to somebody and share their their
57:16 pain and
57:19 be able to help yeah thank you
57:23 for coming to us and sharing your
57:25 experience
57:26 experience of being a mentor with us
57:30 that was very valuable thanks a lot and
57:32 i hope you also liked it
57:34 thank you i enjoyed it a lot thank you
57:35 so much for inviting me
57:37 and thanks everyone for for attending
57:39 and for your questions
57:41 and i will share the recording soon and
57:43 also uh rahul if you can share the link
57:46 to your
57:46 uh to the blog post he mentioned and
57:49 also to the mentoring club
57:50 as well i will put this in slack
57:55 and i'm a member of the slack group as
57:58 well so if you
57:59 have any questions any of the listeners
58:01 they can always reach out to me and i'll
58:02 be
58:03 glad to help thank you
58:06 have a nice day and have a nice weekend
58:09 bye bye everyone
