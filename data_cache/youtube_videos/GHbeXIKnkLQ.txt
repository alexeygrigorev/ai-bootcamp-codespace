0:00 hi everyone Welcome to our event this
0:02 event is brought to you by data do club
0:04 which is a community of people who love
0:05 data we have weekly events but today
0:08 this is a very special event because
0:10 this is not our usual event because
0:12 usually we don't have anything on
0:15 Thursdays this is an anniversary ask me
0:17 anything podcast and uh Johanna will be
0:21 asking me but this is a bit later right
0:23 now I'll just go through the usual
0:24 slides but data talks Club turn four so
0:27 thanks everyone for being with us and
0:30 especially Johanna thank you for being
0:32 with the podcast so long it's like yeah
0:36 amazing anyways um so if you want to
0:39 find out about the events we have there
0:41 is a link in the description click on
0:43 that link do not forget to subscribe to
0:45 our YouTube channel soon we'll have 50k
0:48 subscribers so I'm really looking
0:50 forward to that and join our slack where
0:53 you can hang out with dat enas during
0:56 today's interview you can ask any
0:57 question and since this has asked me
0:59 anything you you should ask me questions
1:02 hopefully uh so the more questions the
1:04 better there is a link in the live chat
1:06 it's pinned or I don't know if I pined
1:09 uh but there's a link I'll make sure
1:11 it's pinned click on that link ask your
1:13 questions and
1:16 yeah uh we will be talking about these
1:19 questions in the podcast and right now
1:22 we have a very special host today
1:25 Johanna Johanna is The Mastermind behind
1:28 all the podcast episodes since
1:32 I don't know you've been doing this for
1:33 two three years almost three I think two
1:36 and a half or something I thought about
1:37 it yeah thought about it today yeah yeah
1:40 so yeah it's amazing and fun fact I just
1:43 now got my official data tu. Club email
1:47 address finally I'm the in the you know
1:51 in the on the
1:53 inside
1:55 yeah um yeah so um welcome everyone um I
1:59 see we have some uh people on YouTube
2:02 also some familiar faces so um the idea
2:05 of this podcast is similar to what we
2:07 did last year so we're going to turn the
2:09 chair around and we're going to have
2:10 alexe in the guest chair basically um
2:13 and we'll give you the also the
2:15 opportunity to ask questions um and uh
2:19 similar to what we usually do um is that
2:23 I'm going to ask the guest to introduce
2:26 himself and don't make it too long
2:28 please okay
2:30 so hi everyone so my name is alexe or
2:32 Alexi so actually in Russian it's alexe
2:35 so the inclination is different but in
2:37 English somehow when I was in the states
2:40 for the first time everyone just called
2:41 me Alexi and this is I I got used to it
2:45 maybe it's similar to Alexi which is a
2:48 female name I think anyways you can call
2:50 me whatever you want so this is my name
2:53 and uh I started data talks Club
2:57 accidentally four years ago so I
3:00 remember it was September
3:03 19th of uh 2020 it was um when everyone
3:08 thought that covid was over but it
3:09 wasn't so I remember so there was this
3:12 first wave and then there was summer and
3:14 everyone relaxed thought okay finally
3:16 now we can go like we can travel I
3:18 remember going to the seaside in Germany
3:20 and thinking oh finally this Co is over
3:23 but time September starts and then
3:26 restrictions and yeah we're sitting at
3:28 home and I thought maybe I should do
3:31 something so this is how data talk Club
3:34 started and it's been 4 years and I am
3:38 really thankful for everyone who got
3:40 involved who I talked to over these
3:43 years and I don't know if I should tell
3:46 anything else about myself I have not
3:49 prepared to this to answer this question
3:52 no I think that's that's a good I mean
3:55 most people probably also know you um
3:57 but yeah you did mostly Java work before
4:00 you went fulltime right like with
4:02 datatax club and now you're doing
4:04 full-time dat. Club so yeah so I was a
4:08 data scientist at Helix and in April
4:13 2023 more than one year ago I decided
4:16 now I need to focus on one thing only
4:19 and it was data do Club cuz for me back
4:22 then it was having two jobs and two
4:26 difficult jobs jobs that require
4:28 attention and time
4:30 and it was not possible to actually give
4:33 both what they they deserve and I
4:35 thought okay now finally I should focus
4:37 on dat do club and besides it was
4:39 already profitable so I did some
4:41 calculation and figure out that if I
4:43 quit the money we have from data do Club
4:45 should be enough to actually cover the
4:47 life in Berlin which is actually not
4:50 that cheap to be honest unfortunately
4:52 it's an expensive city yeah it hasn't it
4:55 hasn't gotten cheaper right like yeah
4:57 it's only becoming more expensive
4:59 exactly
5:00 yeah well cool um so yeah how has the
5:03 year been for you um since we talked
5:05 last
5:06 time well I think uh it's been a very
5:10 good year so we got two new
5:13 sponsors uh the courses are doing pretty
5:15 fine and actually our data engineering
5:18 course that um maybe I I I should talk a
5:22 bit about courses we have like five
5:25 courses last time we talked it was three
5:28 courses it was machine leing engineering
5:31 course ml Zoom Camp it was Data
5:33 engineering Zoom camp and it was mlop
5:35 Zoom
5:36 Camp so this year
5:39 um many things happened over the this uh
5:44 since we spoke last time so our data
5:47 engineering course it got so popular
5:50 unexpectedly so the thing is with data
5:52 engineering course we almost don't
5:54 promote it so there's just a um how do I
5:59 call it like when people recommend the
6:00 course to each other um so this is what
6:04 happens right so everyone just
6:06 recommends it and we don't need to do
6:08 any promotion unlike other courses it's
6:10 so cool and by far it's the most popular
6:13 course it had 24,000 reg registrations
6:18 wow and if you compare it to 8,000
6:20 registrations which is already a huge
6:21 number for like ml course this is insane
6:26 like we did not expect such interest and
6:30 it was very pleasing to see that it's
6:34 taken off and it was the Third Edition
6:36 third time we launched it so at the
6:39 beginning it was like the usual 8K then
6:41 maybe 12K and then it's like
6:44 almost so that was one of the things uh
6:47 then we launched two new
6:49 courses we launched a course about llms
6:53 it was about time this year to finally
6:55 do something about LMS everyone was was
6:57 asking like hey uh why you're not doing
7:00 anything about llms like everyone is
7:02 talking about llms you don't so now we
7:04 joined the hype also did something on
7:08 llms and we had another course which is
7:11 a bit maybe unusual for what we
7:14 typically do it was a course about stock
7:16 market markets
7:19 analytics uh it U is less popular maybe
7:23 because also typically we focus more on
7:25 engineering things rather than analytics
7:28 but NE L it was quite well received so
7:31 it finished and U
7:36 the then unusual thing let's say about
7:38 this course was that I was completely
7:40 out of the course so I was not the
7:43 instructor I almost did not get involved
7:45 so Ivan who is the course instructor the
7:49 lead instructor took care of that so it
7:51 was an interesting experiment for us to
7:53 do to see if a course can happen without
7:56 my
7:57 involvement which proves uh that is
8:00 possible so that's um that was cool and
8:05 there were M maybe thousands of smaller
8:08 things but that was probably the the
8:11 main things that happened yeah yeah I
8:14 mean like uh regarding the nonpromotion
8:16 I do think that the courses are like
8:19 well set up in a way that people
8:21 actually have to post about them right
8:23 like people basically do the promotion
8:24 you kind of uh you soft force them to
8:28 talk about the courses which is good
8:30 also also outside the um out outside of
8:34 the cohort so for example when on R
8:36 somebody asks to recommend a data
8:38 engineering course can you guess what
8:40 they recommend it's our course of course
8:43 so this is super cool so they're not
8:45 getting any points for that like when it
8:48 happens during the course yes we
8:49 incentivize people to do that by by
8:51 giving them virtual points but that is
8:54 happening before the course even starts
8:57 which is even cooler yeah
9:00 yeah so cool um so
9:03 um what has been the most surprising or
9:05 fun thing you've learned this year when
9:08 running the community does anything come
9:10 to mind I remember last year we were
9:12 talking about like date people trying to
9:15 date each other um do you remember that
9:18 oh right right yeah we just kind of yeah
9:22 right now maybe dating is still
9:24 happening but
9:27 because people don't
9:30 mind I don't hear about that I don't
9:33 know
9:35 uh I mean there is uh a lot of scum uh
9:40 lately uh so people and maybe like for
9:43 everyone who is listening if you get a
9:45 mail a DM direct message saying hey like
9:49 I'm not based in the states and I want
9:52 to uh and I'm experienced programmer I
9:55 want to use your up uh upwork account so
9:59 please create an account in upwork I
10:01 will work for you on your behalf and you
10:04 will get to keep like 20% and I'll keep
10:07 80% so this is this is called upwork
10:11 scam and um this is illegal and there
10:16 could be some implications uh so I don't
10:19 know what exactly what they can do bad
10:22 about that but I think they can somehow
10:25 misuse the account and I think all the
10:28 communities are struggling with that
10:29 with people who join the community and
10:32 they start dming everyone saying hey
10:34 like are you where are you from and then
10:37 if it's a Europe or the UK or Australia
10:41 or United States or Canada they say okay
10:44 please set up an account and I'll be
10:47 using your account so if you notice
10:50 anything like that please report to me
10:54 and if um usually if somebody reaches um
10:58 you out in M this is already suspicious
11:00 cuz we typically ask not to do that we
11:04 ask people to use public channels so
11:05 there should be a good reason why
11:07 somebody dams you if it's promotion if
11:09 it's uh some sort of like weird stuff
11:11 like this uh create using your upwork
11:14 account um please report and of course
11:17 use your judgment uh maybe if U I don't
11:21 know you're looking for partner and
11:23 somebody go on a date no no no I
11:27 shouldn't say that like this is a
11:28 professional community so there are
11:30 dating websites don't use it for
11:33 dating yeah yeah I I think you're right
11:37 it can have a really bad um consequences
11:40 yeah for you so yeah wow I didn't even
11:43 know that um yeah um maybe I'll also ask
11:46 some questions from the community um so
11:49 we have one why do um do you choose to
11:52 create a free tolearn community what
11:54 motivation keeps you going and have you
11:57 st thought about stopping or leing the
11:59 Comm Community or the courses
12:04 anytime one question um well luckily I
12:07 have it open in front of me too yes the
12:11 so why do I choose to create a free
12:13 tolearn community there are many things
12:15 but one of them is uh I first benefited
12:18 a lot when I was starting my career in
12:20 data science I benefited a lot from free
12:23 courses and this is my way of paying on
12:27 on giving back um to the community on
12:30 painback and one of these U um on
12:35 corsera it used to be like corsera used
12:36 to have fre courses right now I don't
12:38 think it's the case anymore but apart
12:40 from corsera I was a part of a community
12:42 called open data science it's a it was a
12:47 Russian speaking community based out of
12:49 Moscow it does not exist anymore uh
12:51 because like U closed all the workspaces
12:55 in Russia I think um so this community
12:58 as a whole does not exist but
13:00 surprisingly right now there are so many
13:03 people who still associate with this
13:04 community so for example in Berlin there
13:06 is a a telegram Group which is called
13:10 toes Berlin in Munich there is toes
13:12 Munich in Paris like even though the
13:14 community does not exist anymore it got
13:17 decentralized it got fragmented so which
13:19 is like to me it's a good example of
13:22 real Community where things just happen
13:25 themselves and the community gave people
13:28 the platform to do do that and they self
13:30 organized that did something more even
13:32 when the community stopped existing
13:34 things still happen anyways coming back
13:37 to this ODS open data science at some
13:40 point they run a course which was called
13:43 ml course yeah it was just machine
13:45 learning course but it was a community
13:47 effort so I think like five or six
13:51 people came together and decided to do a
13:54 course together and there was a elite
13:57 instructor who organized all that
14:00 um and this course was
14:03 free and I liked it so much that the
14:08 this idea of openness and everything
14:09 that open data science was doing was
14:12 open so all the activities were free for
14:15 people and that course was amazing right
14:18 and I thought I want to do something
14:20 like that but not in Russian in
14:23 English and when I had a chance I
14:26 finally decided to do this and the
14:29 course but the machine learning course
14:30 was so
14:32 successful and also but it was just me
14:35 right so that was uh just me the
14:37 instructor back then so right now I have
14:39 uh there is team War who is helping me
14:41 with the machine learning course back
14:43 then it was just me recording this so it
14:45 was pretty difficult but one of the
14:47 students of that course reached out to
14:48 me it was anos saying hey let's make a
14:52 course on data
14:53 engineering and with the two other
14:55 community members uh saal and uh um uh
15:00 Victoria we put together a course where
15:04 each of us covered like one or two
15:06 modules so that was like very similar to
15:08 that machine learning course that we did
15:11 and because it's a community course and
15:13 the idea there was to also do this for
15:15 free from the very beginning um and yeah
15:19 it just kind of became its own thing I
15:23 guess
15:24 like uh bigger way bigger than myself
15:29 and I just like the the idea that when
15:34 people give me feedback on how amazing
15:37 what we do it keeps me going right and
15:40 uh I believe in free education and it's
15:42 very cool to see when people from let's
15:44 say Nigeria all they have is a tablet
15:48 right and they ask can we complete this
15:49 course on a tablet and the answer is yes
15:52 they can and they I don't know how many
15:54 of them actually complete but this
15:57 making it possible for
15:59 people um from countries where they
16:02 cannot pay for paid P paid courses to
16:06 get the same
16:07 education right and well actually people
16:10 say that our data engineering course is
16:12 the best course not just among free
16:14 courses but in yeah so and this is like
16:18 when when I get a question like that hey
16:20 like I cannot afford a laptop can I do
16:22 this from tablet this is so
16:24 motivating it's true yeah yeah and I
16:28 think so what motivation what motivates
16:31 me keep keeping going I think I answered
16:34 that right so this feedback from the
16:36 community and like seeing how many
16:38 people sign up I seen especially cool
16:41 when somebody after finishing a course
16:43 says hey your course changed my life how
16:47 Co is that right wow like they found a
16:49 job after that and now they have a good
16:51 salary and sometimes people it was one
16:55 once
16:56 only but uh one of the students she
16:59 finished the course she found a job on
17:02 that job there was training budget and
17:03 she decided to donate to data do Club
17:05 this training bug that's so cool wow
17:09 yeah yeah that was like it was not a lot
17:12 of money money compared to what our
17:14 sponsors typically give us but it was so
17:17 nice like this uh was 500 felt so much
17:22 like getting this 500 felt so much
17:24 better than getting other money from
17:27 sponsors right so that
17:30 was that was cool um well the the sad
17:33 thing is like we have to pay taxes which
17:35 is half of that so 500 like basically
17:39 250 is taxes but that's the cost of
17:41 living in Germany that's uh yeah yeah
17:44 it's very cool like it's so many people
17:46 that are now basically in the broader
17:49 Community right around 100,000 people
17:51 that signed up to the newsletter that's
17:54 that's insane like yeah then there was a
17:57 question if I thought thought of
17:59 stopping it anytime so it might happened
18:03 and I actually thought about that
18:06 so unfortunately the time I decided to
18:09 leave for elix and focus on data talks
18:11 club coincided with the not necessarily
18:15 good market conditions and it was
18:18 already a recession when I decided to
18:20 leave and U Back Then what happened is
18:23 many sponsors actually cancelled the
18:26 sponsorship right so I was expecting to
18:29 get a certain amount of money but then
18:31 the sponsors just cancel they say okay
18:34 like some of them fire the people um
18:37 some of them cut their expenses and
18:39 usually when something like that is
18:41 happening the first thing the company is
18:43 cutting is the marketing budgets yeah
18:45 yeah which is what we usually the
18:48 sponsorship money this is where it comes
18:50 from so then uh back then I think the
18:52 first month was
18:55 um like minus 2 or 3,000
18:59 wow imagine like after leaving the
19:02 company and trying to focus it was just
19:04 yeah expenses wow and yeah and I thought
19:08 okay yeah maybe maybe that was not a
19:11 good
19:13 idea but luckily it worked out but uh I
19:17 never know right so
19:19 if the money stops coming then I'll have
19:22 to find a different way of
19:25 earning and uh which will mean that I
19:28 will not be able to give my full
19:29 attention to data talkx Club because
19:32 having two jobs like it was when uh I
19:34 was working at Alix is very
19:37 difficult so I hope it does not happen
19:40 and I try to so only today I had two
19:44 calls with potential sponsors I don't
19:46 know you never know if it works out or
19:48 not um often times it happens that the I
19:52 think it's working out but then they
19:54 just stopped replying at all yeah so you
19:57 never know but yeah right now I'm
20:00 optimistic so this year definitely next
20:03 year um like we will definitely have the
20:07 data engineering course probably stting
20:08 my LS course so I have runway for more
20:11 than half a year and then we'll
20:13 see yeah wow um I think you told me like
20:17 a little bit of that you had to pay like
20:19 a lot of taxes in advance or something
20:21 around that period was that yeah like in
20:23 Germany there's this weird concept of uh
20:26 prepaid taxes so they calculate the so
20:30 let's say they take the profit for the
20:32 first this is what happened to me last
20:34 last year so they looked at the profits
20:36 for the first three
20:38 months and which is was the time when
20:40 all the companies who did not pay
20:42 finally paid so it was the the first
20:45 three months it was good amount of money
20:47 so they M multiplied it by four and so
20:49 okay this is your expected annual income
20:54 so now every quarter you need to pay us
20:57 uh basically 50 % of that right so they
21:01 think this is what I will earn based on
21:03 the calculations so every quarter I will
21:06 need to pay half of that uh the problem
21:09 was that uh it was not correctly
21:12 calculated so basically finam the the
21:15 tax office was taking almost all the
21:17 money I was earning wow and I had to
21:21 basically at the end they say we they
21:23 cancelled the fourth the the fourth
21:25 quarter
21:27 payment and I I think at the end they
21:29 even returned some money so they were
21:32 very optimistic in their
21:34 calculations uh right now it's not as
21:37 bad because they used the profit from
21:38 the last year to calculate the expected
21:41 profit for this year but still like when
21:44 I see that um half of my money is gone
21:48 because the tax office I gave them the
21:52 posibility of just taking money so then
21:54 I don't accidentally forget because if I
21:56 accidentally forget to pay taxes I have
21:58 a huge problem yeah so what typically
22:00 happens is I give them permission to
22:04 take money from my bank account and when
22:06 I wake up and see that half the money is
22:08 gone I'm
22:10 like yeah taxes are so much fun like
22:13 yeah yeah in Germany maybe it's not the
22:16 best for doing business but on the other
22:19 hand it's actually like I see that the
22:22 taxes
22:23 are I see where the the money goes right
22:27 so like the RO are fixed uh uh my kid
22:31 goes to school which is uh completely
22:33 free like the food there and they they
22:36 have organic food there right organic
22:38 food is
22:39 free and the education is like I also
22:42 got education in Germany well it was
22:45 like 300 per semester but like it's yeah
22:49 and then like with um ukrainians coming
22:51 to Germany uh Germany invested so much
22:54 money in upskilling them so now people
22:57 who came to years go many of them
22:59 already work and now repaying what the
23:02 the government spent on them repaying
23:04 back in taxes um so I'm pretty happy to
23:07 see that this money is not just spent on
23:10 some I don't know
23:13 some uh it does not go to some people's
23:16 pockets but rather goes to back to those
23:20 who pay taxes yeah hopefully those who
23:23 need yeah well I don't know the whole
23:24 story right but from what I
23:27 see uh
23:30 I'm happy of course like now the I don't
23:33 want to talk too much about the politics
23:35 now in Germany the situation may be it's
23:37 not great but let's keep it
23:40 for that's the state of the world at the
23:43 moment right okay so maybe let's return
23:47 to um uh some of the questions um one is
23:51 um are you still active in um ml/ DS
23:56 like actively working on projects aside
23:58 from the course um how do you stay
24:01 relevant and up to date yeah that's a
24:03 good question because it's pretty
24:05 difficult so I have pet projects and
24:07 this is how I try to stand to stay up to
24:09 date but like with pet
24:11 projects it's uh it's not the same as
24:13 working on real product right I still
24:16 get some skills um but yeah it's not the
24:19 same as uh when for example I was
24:22 working at elix and my system for
24:24 detecting uh fraud was used like uh on
24:28 ions of items per day right it's not
24:31 it's nowhere close to that but still I
24:34 try to do my best so one of the pet
24:36 projects I recently did was about
24:38 generating uh horror
24:40 stories and um so what we did my son
24:45 loves horror stories and sometimes he so
24:47 when we walk and he says Hey I want to
24:52 uh I want you to tell me a horror story
24:53 about this three or I want you to tell
24:56 me a horror story about this uh
24:58 I don't know construction site or just
25:01 random things that he just points hey
25:02 tell me a horror story about that then
25:06 there just too difficult to have so many
25:08 horror stories about random things right
25:11 so what we did is like first I thought
25:13 let me just take a a picture of that put
25:16 it to jpt and ask J GPT to make a horror
25:19 story and it was insanely good like the
25:23 stories it was GPT for all the stories
25:27 were so good that I
25:29 thought wow like it would be a Pity If
25:33 this just disappears like if it just
25:35 stays on my um on my
25:38 phone so first thing I did was putting
25:41 this uh stories on a small um GitHub
25:44 Page's website just the stories the text
25:47 but then I thought it would be cool to
25:49 have some illustrations for the stories
25:51 right so then of course I used open DI
25:54 to generate the
25:56 illustrations then I thought it would be
25:59 cool to actually have like um um text to
26:03 speech thing there right so then instead
26:05 of me reading these stories there could
26:08 be like you just play and then a voice
26:11 is telling the story right and then
26:13 eventually what happened is I automated
26:16 the whole thing so I take a picture
26:18 upload it to an S3 bucket and I can take
26:21 as many pictures as I want and then
26:23 periodically there's a gith GitHub cicd
26:26 job GitHub action that pulls one of the
26:29 images creates a story based on that
26:31 creates an illustration creates an audio
26:34 file and then publishes at as a
26:36 podcast what that is amazing so you
26:40 basically you're hosting a second
26:41 podcast now about yeah yeah so let's see
26:44 how popular it becomes maybe I'll stop
26:46 working you can share the link maybe
26:49 people want to it's in russan though so
26:51 I don't know
26:52 how but uh it's actually like all of
26:55 that is open source you can find it on
26:57 my GitHub and and even though the
26:59 content is
27:01 Russian it's python still right so you
27:04 can read it so yeah so I I try to do
27:08 things like that to stay up to date or
27:12 like for example with
27:13 courses like the course for example the
27:16 LM course we
27:17 did it actually
27:20 required some reparation right so some
27:23 research and then I also did um workour
27:28 a kind of an example project which was
27:31 pretty cool it was about
27:34 um uh gym excises fitness exercises like
27:38 for example if you go to gym and you
27:40 want to replace certain exercise with
27:42 something else you can chat with the
27:43 system and ask hey I want the
27:45 replacement for I don't know push shops
27:48 right and then it would tell you what
27:50 you can do instead so that was a cool
27:53 project
27:54 too yeah so I tried doing things like
27:56 that and then um it's not related to
27:59 AI but I also try to not forget how to
28:04 program by doing different things like
28:06 sometimes it's just simple things like
28:08 simple scripts simple automation scripts
28:10 sometimes it's larger things like for
28:12 example for courses right now we have a
28:13 course management platform which is
28:16 um project written in Jango so there is
28:19 no Ai No machine learning simply
28:22 engineering project but still I try
28:24 to uh spent uh time there so I have
28:29 muscle memory of writing code cuz one of
28:31 the problems for me was that when I work
28:34 at oix last year I was sort of in a
28:37 managerial role and data talk Club was
28:39 not also a place where I would write
28:42 code So eventually with time I realized
28:44 that uh yeah my coding skills are not so
28:46 good anymore so then I forcing myself to
28:52 uh to do things here and there to
28:54 actually remember how to program yeah
28:57 yeah I think that's kind of a general
28:59 the general faith of someone who moves
29:01 up the lettera right that you get more
29:03 managerial roles and less um happens to
29:06 everyone I guess and what I wanted to
29:08 ask you is like actually how did the llm
29:11 course go because I know you were like
29:13 bit skeptical at the beginning or like
29:15 yeah like for me LM was this thing that
29:17 was like I thought it would it would be
29:20 something like web 3 or blockchain or
29:23 you know this think that all of a sudden
29:26 everyone is talking about that but one
29:28 month later nobody is talking about that
29:31 anymore so I was kind of skeptical about
29:34 all this llm stuff it was cool like that
29:37 I remember the first time I learned
29:38 about jgpt it was on one of our courses
29:42 somebody asked to write it a poem it was
29:45 gpt3 back then somebody asked it to
29:48 write a poem about machine learning Zoom
29:49 camp and the poem was actually good and
29:52 then I thought okay there might be
29:54 something to this and then uh like
30:00 I started seeing more and more of that
30:02 and last year like it was just AI all
30:04 over the place and this year I thought
30:06 okay yeah maybe it's time we also did
30:08 something because
30:11 um like actually when I look at these
30:13 llms and
30:16 um even though I did not um work at
30:21 elixman llms um so when I work at elix
30:25 we didn't I did not have any LM projects
30:28 but surprisingly many things from my
30:29 personal experience still apply right so
30:32 for example Rock which is R generation
30:36 the core component of rck is search and
30:38 I've been doing search for I don't know
30:40 more than 10 years like for me it was ah
30:43 okay here's search and then now all of a
30:44 sudden like to me it's okay now I know
30:47 how to do it so hopefully like luckily I
30:50 have all these Concepts from my past
30:52 that really helped me
30:54 to understand this thing and the course
30:57 went really well I really happy with the
30:59 outcome I also learned many new things
31:02 um and now it's
31:05 recorded so yeah I'm happy with the
31:08 outcome yeah great I actually had a
31:10 similar introduction to l&m's like I I
31:13 like things only when I understand them
31:15 so at the beginning I was like I don't
31:16 trust this and then I did a course from
31:18 my uni about it it's like this is super
31:20 interesting like transformers this is I
31:23 can do that myself you know I can I can
31:25 play with that like I can use pych uh um
31:28 yeah wow yeah very cool um yeah the
31:31 course is still around so people can
31:32 check it out um and like go through it
31:35 um so the next question is you've been
31:38 doing data talks uh fulltime since
31:40 almost two years house life uh would you
31:43 reverse a decision um of leaving
31:45 corporate or would you change anything I
31:47 think we've partially answered that but
31:49 maybe you can give and actually this is
31:51 a question from a friend of mine
31:54 and so hi um so
31:58 so yeah um life has been good like I
32:02 don't want to change anything I I have
32:04 no regrets uh yeah there were tough
32:07 times uh there were super good times
32:09 there were just okay times um I'm so
32:12 happy with uh where I am right now so my
32:15 only hope is it continues but then like
32:18 there are things that are outside of my
32:20 control and if for whatever reasons I
32:24 need to find job I'm I'm certain that
32:27 I'll be able to at least find a software
32:29 engineering job where definely I'll be
32:31 useful yeah so I don't have any regret
32:35 whether I'll be coming to corporate
32:38 again or not that's a big question I am
32:41 not so sure and not so inclined to go
32:44 back to working at a corporation so
32:46 probably it will be a smaller company if
32:48 it happens and also like I was thinking
32:53 what would I do if not data do club like
32:55 where would I see myself and probably it
32:57 would be some sort of Deval position
32:59 where I can teach and I can quote right
33:02 so I can do both so still technical role
33:07 but
33:08 also lets me uh how I
33:12 say so I have this passion of educating
33:15 people so I'll be able to accomplish
33:18 that too so probably it will be
33:19 something like a deal position but yeah
33:22 I don't know we will see so life has
33:24 been great I don't want to I have no
33:26 regrets and I I don't think I want to
33:29 change
33:31 anything cool um and uh what was a
33:35 memorable moment at the beginning where
33:37 you knew this will take
33:39 off so probably it was the first uh uh
33:45 it's actually a different Dimitri
33:46 Dimitri yeah so hi Dimitri um so Dimitri
33:51 asks that I think in LinkedIn and I just
33:53 put this to the form so I I think when
33:56 we had our first event
33:59 uh that then I understood this is
34:02 something there is something so like
34:06 when I worked at
34:07 Alix there is a part of my contract that
34:10 says that I'm not allowed to do any site
34:14 projects unless I have an explicit
34:17 permission from my manager to do them
34:19 right so the first couple of months
34:20 we're under the raadar right so it was
34:23 not it was not taking a lot of my time
34:25 it just was something like let me set
34:27 the top and see how it goes um so I
34:31 wasn't
34:33 actively doing much there right so I
34:36 just set set up a slack account but one
34:38 of the things I did was reaching out to
34:41 people who joins and asking them why
34:44 they joined what they want to find here
34:47 what kind of things they're interested
34:49 in and so on right and by the way so I I
34:52 met this way I got in touch and met so
34:56 many people who
34:58 later became like these uh coin
35:01 instructors or podcast guests or simply
35:04 friends people who I meet like some of
35:07 them quite a few of them were actually
35:09 from Berlin incidentally I don't know
35:11 maybe because I'm there too so anyways I
35:14 was uh talking with people trying to
35:17 figure out what would be interesting for
35:19 them and then I more or less understood
35:22 what they like and then another guy he
35:26 says
35:28 do you know where I can talk and I say
35:30 yeah I know and then cuz I knew what
35:33 people are interested in and what he
35:36 wanted to talk about was relevant so he
35:38 gave the talk and 100 people joined it
35:42 and before that I actually I was I
35:45 thought okay now
35:46 it's it's not I think that under the
35:49 Rader think it's actually becoming
35:51 something like a side project now I need
35:53 to talk to my manager so I spoke with my
35:55 manager he said yeah whatever uh and
35:58 then this thing happened like the first
35:59 event and 100 people joined and then I
36:01 understood okay like if 100 people
36:03 joined then it's something good right of
36:07 course like the second event was 20
36:09 people the third event was 10 people so
36:11 there's probably this uh novelty effect
36:14 but still like I realized that uh I'm on
36:18 to
36:19 something yeah so um but like the birth
36:22 of that talk is also it coincided with
36:25 the pandemic right and a lot of
36:27 community ities were created so why do
36:29 you think that dat talk is actually
36:31 still there why while a lot of other
36:34 communities I think you know died more
36:36 or less so one thing and I actually
36:40 consulted and talk spoke with many
36:42 people who were asking my opinion on
36:44 communities so there there is this idea
36:47 that you simply create a community and
36:48 then it will live on uh by itself which
36:52 may happen it can happen I have seen it
36:55 happening for example this open data
36:57 science
36:59 um it became a true
37:01 Community like even the main place after
37:05 the main place where people hang out
37:07 disappeared the community is still there
37:09 right it's so decentralized like this is
37:11 to me it's like the perfect example of a
37:13 true
37:14 Community many communities are not like
37:17 that they require active time investment
37:20 also money investment like they require
37:23 work right and then there is this idea
37:25 that you just create a community people
37:27 come and start talking to each other
37:29 right it does not happen so you need to
37:33 actively make it worth for people to
37:35 come back if you don't then they don't
37:38 come back and then Community die right
37:40 so maybe only spammers go there to
37:42 promote their stuff and then it's just
37:44 the place where spammers hang
37:46 out they don't hang out there they just
37:48 come there maybe some people even have
37:50 just Bots right they spam each other
37:53 yeah so yeah maybe that's uh that's one
37:57 of the things like the community die if
38:00 you don't keep it alive right so and I
38:04 kept it alive um because I was getting
38:08 so much from the community like all the
38:11 feedback people give like it's so
38:13 rewarding and that's why like if there
38:16 was no this positive reinforcement I
38:18 would have stopped probably
38:20 too but yeah so every time somebody says
38:24 thank you your course is really great
38:27 like it
38:28 like it really helps me to
38:31 continue okay um cool so the next
38:35 question is what do you think about the
38:37 possibility of AI replacing data
38:39 analysts oh no now it's gone uh did you
38:43 did you I might
38:46 have yeah you you see the question did
38:49 you yeah I have do it's in the archives
38:53 it's in the archives in your opinion
38:57 back right yeah let me see yes so so
39:02 let's do it again what do you think
39:04 about the possibility of AI replacing
39:06 data analysts in your opinion what could
39:08 be the next level for a data analyst as
39:11 ml
39:14 engineer I think partly yes for simple
39:17 things but analyst is not just about uh
39:20 using SQL to build dashboards right
39:23 there is much
39:24 more um like there is talking to people
39:27 component there is uh business domain
39:29 expertise component right so there are
39:32 many other things like you can also say
39:33 that
39:35 AI is replacing or has replaced data
39:37 scientist right cuz like you don't need
39:40 an llm to build a good machine learning
39:43 model like 5 years ago even 10 years ago
39:45 we had this
39:46 autl uh packages that would you just
39:49 throw in a cc file and you get the best
39:52 possible model not maybe the best
39:53 possible but a reasonably good model
39:56 right so
39:58 these automl packages have been around
40:00 for quite some time
40:03 and like for example if you take a kle
40:05 competition if you just take a cc file
40:09 you throw it to some I don't know maure
40:11 Azure autl or Google autl or whatever
40:15 automl it will give you a pretty decent
40:17 result of course you will not get into
40:19 top 10 results in on the kago
40:21 leaderboard cuz you need like 3 months
40:24 to do that um but it will be okay result
40:27 for a model that is ready to for
40:30 production right but why data scientists
40:32 are still around like for some reasons
40:35 they're still around right it means that
40:37 the job of a data scientist is not just
40:39 to take a CSV file and train a model
40:42 there's something more right um so yeah
40:46 I don't think AI is going to replace uh
40:49 data analy data scientists or anyone who
40:51 you needs to use their brain for work
40:53 right so building charts yeah but uh I
40:57 can think I think of AI is not something
41:00 that replaces people but more like helps
41:05 them it's like um when autopilot
41:10 appeared usual Pilots were still needed
41:13 right yeah and even though right now
41:15 planes I don't know how much involvement
41:18 Pilots need to to have it's maybe they
41:22 just sit and watch all the time right uh
41:26 like I'm sitting near the window and
41:28 look outside maybe this is how the
41:30 pilots spent their their flights too I
41:33 don't know but they are still need it
41:35 they're still sitting there and actually
41:37 two of them right yeah so there must be
41:39 reason why they're still there yeah so I
41:42 think with data this their job will just
41:44 become simpler because now you don't
41:46 need to spend a lot of time right in all
41:48 this uh
41:50 nasty uh SQL queries that are super
41:53 complex now you can delegate this that
41:55 work or like finding box or
41:59 something yeah but still you need to
42:01 talk to business you need to understand
42:03 what kind
42:04 of what kind of things they do like and
42:07 when you think about metrics right so
42:09 when you build a dashboard you want to
42:10 show some metrics there but like these
42:12 metrics just don't appear out of the
42:14 blue like you need to know that you want
42:16 to compute this particular metric yeah
42:18 how do you do this by talking to
42:20 business and find out what they care
42:22 about so AI cannot do that exactly yeah
42:26 it's the same like I'm bit more from the
42:27 medical field Anda that I will replace
42:30 doctors but then you know people don't
42:33 only go to the doctor to get a diagnosis
42:35 you know they want to talk to someone
42:36 they want like you know they want to
42:38 have I wish I would be able just to talk
42:41 to a ey
42:43 instead because like I don't know maybe
42:46 it's just a Germany thing but like
42:48 sometimes I feel worse after going to a
42:52 doctor yeah maybe that would be an
42:54 improvement actually yeah
42:57 yeah sometimes yes but like for for
42:59 certain things like when I get the so
43:02 for example one time it happened to me
43:05 like my kid was um he just started going
43:07 to kindergarten and he would bring back
43:10 a lot of viruses and like different
43:12 sorts of infections I was sick all the
43:15 time and then I asked the doctor like
43:17 hey like what can I do and he said like
43:19 get rid of the
43:20 [Laughter]
43:22 kid well
43:25 yeah like a I think AI would give me a
43:28 better it was funny okay I still
43:31 remember
43:34 that well but like I think AI would give
43:37 would have given a better recommendation
43:39 maybe not as
43:41 memorable also like this doctor having
43:43 like you know so many years of medical
43:46 school and then this career to give you
43:48 this answer well no he said like later
43:51 he said
43:53 um cuz kids he explained me the
43:56 reasoning behind behind this uh behind
43:58 his
43:59 answer that kids produce more viruses
44:02 than adults because of certain things so
44:06 he said like it's natural yeah like
44:08 there's no way around that apart from
44:10 getting rid of the kid like you will
44:12 have infections and he said okay now you
44:14 can drink less coffee sleep more go to
44:17 gym like you know the usual
44:19 stuff yeah well yeah maybe I think well
44:26 I needed for from him like to be honest
44:28 to be fair like all I needed from him
44:31 was like just
44:33 a excuse not to go to work like you know
44:35 this paper yeah yeah yeah that makes
44:38 sense yeah um then uh I have one
44:42 question that is not the like the next
44:44 one but I think it's it's a is a 1989
44:47 your year of uh birth because it's on
44:50 your
44:51 is it is my year of think I'll be 35 I
44:57 will I be 35 this year no you 36 I think
45:01 because I'm also 1989 and I'll turn but
45:05 my birthday is in November it's November
45:09 and ah okay remember how old I am yeah
45:12 then you're then you be 35 yeah yeah
45:15 like every time I need to calculate how
45:17 old I am I need to like do the math
45:20 and okay now it's 2024 I am born in uh
45:25 uh 89 yeah it would be 25 uh 35 35 35
45:32 wow cool um and uh what is the biggest
45:36 challenge or learning you didn't expect
45:38 to have when scating the community I
45:40 think we've also touched upon this but
45:42 maybe um how much time it will require
45:47 an effort so I'm like looking back I'm
45:49 still not so sure why I did that cuz I I
45:53 think it was just
45:55 um it was giv G me some meaning to what
45:59 I do CU it was Co my work was uh not
46:03 what
46:04 I it was not how to say satisfying me
46:08 enough right so I was already sort of
46:10 managerial in a managerial
46:12 role and
46:15 uh yeah like it required a lot of work
46:19 and then uh it required also putting a
46:23 lot of work without getting getting
46:24 anything in return
46:27 was the
46:28 first how much was it 500 or less
46:32 dollars it was after half a year a year
46:36 and a half or maybe more after two
46:38 years uh of the community existence when
46:41 I finally made the first money wow so it
46:44 required some some effort yeah and
46:49 scaling yeah it was uh like I didn't
46:52 think about scaling I was just thinking
46:55 okay what can I do for people to have
46:58 fun and come back to the community and
47:00 they they were coming
47:02 back and also actually before it was
47:05 even profitable I got an offer somebody
47:08 wanted to like there was a company who
47:09 wanted to acquire the
47:11 community and I decided not to do that
47:14 because I thought now if it becomes my
47:18 job uh and somebody will tell me what to
47:20 do I will not
47:21 liked so now I really enjoy like being
47:24 independent in the sense that I don't
47:27 need to follow somebody's agenda
47:29 somebody's
47:30 decisions yeah yeah that is really cool
47:33 I didn't even know that wow um and like
47:35 did you it's the first time I talked to
47:37 you about this in public I think yeah
47:39 yeah I think so wow I didn't know that
47:41 yeah and did you like at the beginning
47:43 like feel like that you were kind of
47:45 lonely in your mission or something
47:47 because I feel like there not like h no
47:50 well the community is uh kind of the
47:52 opposite of loneliness I was thinking
47:55 more about like that you don't know that
47:57 many people who are also creating
47:59 communities like that their actually
48:02 like for example I was quite often in
48:05 touch with demetros from the mops
48:07 Community we even have we even had a
48:10 community Mastermind group with um there
48:13 was uh somebody from uh locally
48:17 optimistic which is a community for
48:20 um for analysts then metrius from mops
48:24 Community me and then there was somebody
48:26 from the DBT
48:28 community so we like every week or every
48:31 two weeks uh would sit together and
48:35 discuss different challenges it was
48:38 interesting so definitely like having a
48:40 community help
48:42 me have more connections than before
48:45 yeah and that's maybe one of the reasons
48:47 I kept doing this because like meeting
48:50 or new
48:52 people
48:54 and not just new people but like also
48:56 having
48:57 these people come back and uh like
49:00 developing these meaningful connections
49:02 it was super cool cool and I see for
49:05 example so megi is here an Antonius is
49:08 here hi guys so it's so cool to to have
49:12 you and everyone else too like
49:14 developing these connections and then uh
49:17 also having like uh for example with
49:19 medie we he's not in Berlin anymore but
49:22 we used to have lunches regularly um so
49:26 yeah the commun Community gave me
49:28 personally a lot of things and being
49:30 lonely is definitely not not one of them
49:33 cool so I think opposite yeah cool and
49:38 yeah I think having a group of people
49:40 who want to scale a community that is
49:42 definitely cool um and uh what would you
49:45 like to achieve in the upcoming years
49:47 that's also a good one so I need more
49:50 sponsors so that's what I want to do so
49:53 probably doing more stuff I want to try
49:56 try to do more courses because right now
49:59 we have this course platform I mentioned
50:00 the one I did in Django cuz previously
50:03 it was so much manual work so it was
50:06 like a bunch of Python scripts Google
50:08 forms a lot of manual actions um so it
50:11 required a lot of work to actually run a
50:13 course right now it less effort right
50:16 now I can just give access to the admin
50:18 panel of Jango to other instructors
50:22 and not being involved so for example
50:25 that course uh the stock markets
50:27 analytics course
50:29 happened without me also thanks to
50:34 because of this platform right so now I
50:36 can be less involved into day-to-day Ops
50:39 of courses and focus more on creating
50:41 courses that's why we also did this LM
50:43 course this year because finally I could
50:45 have time to do something else
50:47 besides this Ops behind the
50:50 courses um so I want to do more
50:53 courses uh probably something related to
50:56 date engineering in we will see on
50:59 specifics um it also depends on um like
51:03 what people want and also what companies
51:04 want to promote so I want to find in the
51:06 section so it should be useful for
51:08 companies and for people so then uh for
51:12 me also like I can pay for this flat
51:15 which is not that
51:18 cheap yeah it has to be sustainable
51:20 right like everywh so cool yeah
51:25 um so uh is there anything I or others
51:29 can do um do to help our community to
51:32 grow and improve that's from Dayton D
51:35 you know D yeah um well there are many
51:39 things so we have um well first of all
51:42 you can be a guest on the podcast right
51:44 you can tell your friends about the
51:45 community you can uh help others in
51:49 slack you can um we have a thing called
51:53 project of the week this is a very cool
51:55 thing where we prepare a plan for a week
51:59 to study and we follow this um this is a
52:03 super cool project sometimes uh sadly
52:06 doesn't get a lot of traction um we can
52:10 think what can we do similar
52:12 to um get feedback from Community to for
52:16 Community people to be involved and also
52:19 maybe
52:20 um get involved into these activities
52:24 like for example when there is a project
52:25 over the week um it's a bit sad
52:28 sometimes when um Adonis who is one of
52:31 um the people who are here hi Adonis
52:33 again um so when he puts um like a lot
52:36 of effort into creating this plan for
52:37 the project of the week to see that only
52:40 one person is doing that together so
52:43 many people I I think it's not just one
52:45 person is doing that but not everyone is
52:48 um vocal about that and maybe what would
52:52 help is like when you do something like
52:53 that also be vocal talk about this so
52:56 then it creates a sense of okay I am not
52:58 doing this uh alone right and then uh
53:02 maybe there is something else we can do
53:05 together like this project of the week
53:07 so for
53:08 example there was an idea
53:10 to do a hackaton as a part of LM Zoom
53:14 cam course uh right now the course is
53:16 still wrapping up and uh I think there
53:19 are like 10 people who are interested in
53:21 uh doing a hakon at least 10 so maybe
53:25 you want to help organize that so could
53:27 be interesting too so DM means slck if
53:31 any of these things uh sound interesting
53:33 and we'll talk about making them happen
53:36 but I think so maybe this hakon and
53:39 project of the week maybe we can somehow
53:41 put them
53:42 together yeah that sounds super good
53:45 yeah yeah yeah so I think U so we had
53:49 competitions already so as a part of LM
53:52 course we had a competition as a part of
53:55 ml course we will have a comp comptition
53:57 but we did not have a hakon yet so this
53:59 is something I want to do so if somebody
54:01 wants to get involved let me know yeah
54:04 and also um I'll add a Shameless plug
54:06 for the podcast so if you feel um you
54:10 want to be up here you know in the guest
54:12 chair then just reach out um it can be
54:15 about your job it can be about anything
54:17 that interests you um so yeah don't be
54:19 shy especially interesting um if it's
54:22 the first time people appear on a
54:23 podcast so for people who have been on
54:26 the podcasts maybe it's like it's easier
54:28 for them cuz they have talked already
54:30 and they can just talk about the same
54:33 thing but it's also interesting when you
54:35 haven't spoken on a podcast yet right
54:38 and uh everyone has something to share
54:41 uh I'm sure cuz like when I meet people
54:44 in real life and we for example drink I
54:47 don't know tea or sit and talk and then
54:49 uh I don't know I have this podcast host
54:53 kind start asking questions this always
54:56 so interesting and I'm like ah P we are
54:59 not recording
55:00 this and then I usually invite uh them
55:04 to do a podcast not everyone agrees and
55:08 I don't judge anyone it's not for
55:09 everyone I agree um but yeah if you want
55:12 to be here please uh reach to
55:16 us yeah please reach out um there's a
55:21 question about when the stock market
55:24 analysis course starts I think it's
55:25 already finished right but people can
55:28 thei and I we talked about this recently
55:31 he wants to do it one more time next
55:34 year uh we haven't decided on a date yet
55:37 on a month uh so probably around April
55:42 what we want to do is two workshops
55:43 before that um something extra that we
55:48 that wasn't covered in the course so
55:51 we're talking about
55:53 that cool so you you will definitely
55:55 know so least soon we will have uh
55:57 workshops so one probably in November
56:00 and one like in February you will
56:02 definitely learn hear about them uh in
56:06 our newsletter you will see them we will
56:08 also post about them in social
56:10 media so you will see them and probably
56:13 there will be a for where you can sign
56:14 up sign up for the course and you just
56:17 sign
56:19 up yeah I have um participated in the
56:22 last one like a little bit it was really
56:23 interesting but I I'm really interested
56:25 in finances so yeah but it's really it's
56:28 really an interesting one um a question
56:30 for you I know I know um so this is Yana
56:33 how do you prepare the questions for the
56:35 podcast um how did this evolve over time
56:38 so um my qualifying feature to getting
56:41 this position was that I I think it was
56:44 LinkedIn like I sent a under a post I I
56:47 sent that I had listened to all the
56:49 episodes which was true um of the
56:52 podcast and that I really liked the
56:54 podcast and then Alexi reached out and
56:55 asked me but I want to help prepare them
56:58 and that was almost three years ago and
57:00 yeah um and how I usually do it is like
57:03 um I get the guest and then this is
57:06 actually the part that I like about it
57:08 the most like I get to uh go through the
57:11 guests LinkedIn like read material that
57:13 they provide so I I kind of stalk the
57:15 guest a bit um and come up with a good
57:17 topic um and then I usually also meet
57:19 them before the episode and I create
57:21 some questions and uh they usually go
57:25 through them and agree that they want to
57:27 be asked these questions and then yeah
57:29 they're ready to go and it's a lot of
57:30 fun because you get to learn about
57:33 people's careers and also about very
57:35 different spectrum of topics um and yeah
57:39 that's I think pretty much it and yeah
57:41 it usually takes me around an hour per
57:44 guest from like start to finish yeah
57:48 yeah so and uh like were you
57:53 surprised like because not always the
57:55 questions you prepare this is not how we
57:58 end up yeah yeah yeah so yeah so Alexi
58:03 Strays quite a bit the questions but
58:05 they're more like a backup so I'm yeah
58:08 yeah and sometimes I have to say like
58:10 now especially when I meet the guest and
58:12 like when I get to talk to them I
58:14 sometimes don't listen to the episode
58:15 anymore because I feel like I have yeah
58:18 I've heard it all so surprised yeah yeah
58:22 so now you're kind of podcast host
58:24 yourself right yeah yeah so it's usually
58:27 not my you know I like being in the
58:29 backs but sometimes it's also fun to to
58:32 talk cool
58:34 um uh what do we have maybe do we have
58:38 time for one more question we have
58:40 something around um whether it's um too
58:43 late to start being a data
58:46 scientist um no I don't think it's late
58:50 as I said again like AI is just your
58:53 kind of friend like is a tool that you
58:55 use it's not something that replaces you
58:57 it's one of the tools in your tool set
59:01 so and if
59:03 you're if you now want to become a data
59:06 scientist actually with this Tool It's
59:08 the Best Time Ever to start being a data
59:11 scientist because previously you had to
59:13 learn so much to be to to be able to do
59:18 these things and now you can just ask
59:20 chpd and it will help you and then like
59:24 um
59:27 yeah you just need to I guess uh learn
59:29 to use it to be effective but I I think
59:32 being a data scientist is a good like
59:34 the other thing is um we also need to
59:37 keep in mind like the market conditions
59:39 right now CU it's difficult to be a
59:42 junior companies are very reluctant now
59:45 to hire Juniors which is kind of weird
59:48 because everyone wants to have seniors
59:51 but seniors they get promoted they
59:53 change jobs uh they become self employed
59:57 and then somebody needs to replace them
59:58 right CU like the population of seniors
1:00:01 is only shrinking so companies need
1:00:04 fresh blood but they are not hiring
1:00:06 Juniors or hiring less uh so like in my
1:00:10 mind it should be like a pyramid so a
1:00:12 lot of Juniors then fewer middle level
1:00:15 then fewer seniors then fewer leads and
1:00:17 so on right but the pyramid now is kind
1:00:20 of weird so the foundation the juniors
1:00:23 are yeah not there anymore
1:00:27 yeah it's improving yeah and I do agree
1:00:30 I think um you know it's not going to be
1:00:33 less data in the future rather more data
1:00:36 so um and I also think it's a good uh
1:00:39 way for you know cross entry like people
1:00:41 that have done something else before um
1:00:44 because it's rather yeah easy to learn
1:00:47 so much material if you have engineering
1:00:51 background being a data scientist still
1:00:53 is a very good idea
1:00:56 yeah and then it will give you an edge
1:00:58 or having some sort of academic
1:01:00 background with expertise in certain
1:01:02 area that companies need
1:01:04 yeah yeah so yeah don't don't be shy I
1:01:07 would say just start um cool I think um
1:01:11 we're almost we're at the hour but
1:01:13 there's always the traditional last
1:01:15 question which is like have you do you
1:01:16 have a book recommendation for us or
1:01:18 anything that you're reading at the
1:01:19 moment
1:01:21 recommendation well what I'm reading so
1:01:23 right now actually I'm reading this
1:01:31 oh it's a is it about a boy in a it's a
1:01:35 bit heavy isn't it or my yeah uh so
1:01:38 right now I am in the part where he
1:01:40 found out that there are some people in
1:01:43 uniforms who are so I think it will
1:01:46 start being heavy right now yeah yeah
1:01:49 wow you reading like German books that's
1:01:51 that's Advanced I guess I mean reading
1:01:53 maybe is an over statement it's in my
1:01:57 desk there is a
1:02:00 bookmark sometimes I read it but yeah
1:02:05 apart from that like I'm reading a book
1:02:07 about
1:02:08 um exercises for um for back and for
1:02:14 lower body
1:02:16 um then uh like when it comes to courses
1:02:19 uh I'm kind of biased to give
1:02:21 recommendations of course yeah but there
1:02:24 is one community that does really cool
1:02:27 courses you should check it out I wonder
1:02:31 which one that is yeah of
1:02:33 course cool um well I think um yeah on
1:02:36 that note um this was a pleasure do we
1:02:38 have anything else that we should
1:02:40 mention anything um I just want to thank
1:02:43 you personally johana thanks for being
1:02:45 around for helping like you're such a
