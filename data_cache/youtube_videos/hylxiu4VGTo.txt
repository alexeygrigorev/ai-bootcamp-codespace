0:46 okay this week we'll talk about
0:48 recruiting data engineers and we have a
0:50 special guest today nick nicholas nicola
0:53 correct way pronouncing french yeah
0:57 yes so nicola is a technical recruiter
0:59 who is hiring for a wide variety of
1:01 engineering and ai roles
1:04 he works for many years as an in-house
1:06 recruiter for companies like retail
1:08 so welcome nicola to nikola to our event
1:12 yeah thanks for having me
1:15 before we go into our main topic of
1:17 recruiting data engineers let's start
1:19 with your background can you tell us
1:20 about your career journey so far
1:22 um yeah so
1:24 in terms of um education so i've studied
1:27 uh international business
1:29 for several years
1:31 then i did a master's degree in
1:34 hr um so that was
1:36 a broad topic then i started my career
1:40 uh in um in the tech industry uh so i've
1:44 been working for the tech industry
1:46 uh really like since the beginning and
1:48 so so i first joined after graduation a
1:50 company called the cradle so they are
1:53 leaders in
1:54 uh online digital advertising and
1:57 personalized advertising um so yeah so
1:59 here i started as a
2:01 sourcer
2:02 to a
2:03 recruiter
2:04 um yeah and so i've been hiring for
2:07 different kind of roles most of them
2:09 were like software engineering
2:11 and i had like a
2:13 focus on anything i would say data so
2:16 really for my data analysts data
2:19 engineering
2:20 data science machine learning
2:22 engineering and also uh research
2:24 scientists um as well and so i
2:27 helped
2:29 build the ai lab of this company
2:32 which is
2:33 kind of
2:34 pretty successful
2:35 and so yeah and since last year um yeah
2:38 so i've joined a um
2:40 a company called on fido as a british
2:43 company um and so yeah and so they do
2:46 basically they are in the field of
2:49 online identity verification and so yeah
2:52 and here's the same doing uh
2:55 you know so it's yeah both companies are
2:57 very
2:58 data and machine learning
3:00 oriented focus um so yeah so yeah so
3:03 yeah and here i'm working and hiring in
3:06 four different locations across europe
3:10 which counts
3:12 um sorry so we have a we have the uk um
3:15 and then we
3:16 are hiring in france portugal
3:19 netherlands and germany
3:21 maybe more something
3:23 we know
3:26 so you
3:27 you said you were hiring so maybe it was
3:29 for about criteria so you said europe
3:31 you're hiring
3:32 research scientists but now at uh on
3:35 video so what kind of roles
3:38 and levels do you recruit for
3:40 um yeah so for now we are hiring for uh
3:44 mostly i would say um intermediate to uh
3:47 senior um levels i would say mostly
3:51 uh yeah in terms of um
3:53 like profiles uh we literally have like
3:55 a bit of like everything so you have
3:57 like uh so yeah so i do hire like
3:59 back-end front-end i do devops and i do
4:02 security engineering i do research
4:06 uh i also um work on the data and
4:09 analytics piece so you're gonna have bi
4:12 analytics data engineering
4:15 um yeah and also hiring for machine
4:17 learning engineering so yeah so yeah so
4:19 yeah basically i'm just hiring for like
4:22 everything for like software uh yeah and
4:24 yeah i'm not really working for a like
4:27 products for example rose at the moment
4:29 but uh yeah i can help if needed
4:32 and you mentioned that you are looking
4:35 for candidates in four countries the uk
4:38 france portugal and germany and i'm
4:40 wondering
4:42 how different it is the
4:44 candidates that you
4:47 find confined
4:48 in these countries and processes like uh
4:51 is it the same or different
4:53 did you see any differences in these
4:54 countries
4:56 um
4:58 no so
4:59 i would say so this is more about like
5:01 the the market uh really um not
5:04 um i mean
5:06 the uk and london's was i would say i
5:09 mean like more than 10 years ago like
5:11 the place for uh like tech
5:14 uh then berlin um you know uh grew a lot
5:18 uh paris as well
5:20 um also uh i would say like like the
5:23 netherlands um so yeah so yeah so yeah
5:25 but you do have like some
5:27 countries where you to you have like a
5:30 more um lively let's say uh
5:33 text
5:34 tech scene uh i would say uh yeah
5:36 portugal is um he's also like uh doing
5:39 uh pretty well uh since the the last uh
5:41 the last years um so yeah yeah for me
5:43 that's i would say like the the
5:45 difference it's more like the number of
5:46 um tech companies and um that's uh that
5:50 you have you know yeah yeah we could
5:53 observe a difference really like like
5:55 five ten years ago
5:57 uh now it's uh it's less
6:00 different i would say yeah i imagine in
6:03 london when you hire you need to compete
6:05 with all the big names all the big tech
6:08 companies right but in berlin it's
6:10 mostly you compete with startups
6:12 um right and then maybe this is
6:15 intel um
6:17 yeah i mean
6:18 it depends because like now you have uh
6:21 like companies are like carrying across
6:23 like different countries like you have
6:25 like less and less borders i would say
6:27 especially like in like in europe so in
6:29 the end for example when you to
6:31 hire within the eu you know uh whether
6:34 you're like higher in france
6:36 for example or in germany uh it's not
6:39 only like berlin so you can hire like
6:40 someone who's like like anywhere
6:42 basically
6:44 in the country
6:45 um sorry i'm sorry but yeah competition
6:47 is like you have like more and more
6:49 companies more and more like high demand
6:51 jobs as well um so yeah so yeah so now
6:54 it tends to be like i would say
6:56 borderless recruitment
6:59 okay yeah quite interesting so actually
7:02 the reason i reached out to you a couple
7:04 of weeks ago and invited to this podcast
7:06 is because we had a different podcast
7:08 episode it was about hiring data
7:10 professionals and we talked to alicia
7:12 who was a guest here but we mostly
7:15 talked about data scientists
7:17 and then some people reached out to me
7:20 saying hey that was a cool episode but
7:22 we want to hear more about data
7:24 engineers
7:25 so here we go we talk about hiring data
7:28 engineers but we i also wanted to ask
7:31 you so you are recruiting for a wide
7:34 range of positions so also ml engineers
7:37 data scientists or data analysts data
7:40 engineers so in your opinion what is the
7:42 main difference between hiring data
7:44 scientists and data engineers
7:47 um
7:48 yeah so
7:50 so i would say there's two different um
7:52 things um
7:54 then it's you have like a kind of like a
7:57 ratio uh between like like tech and
8:01 business um i would say
8:03 um so yeah i would say like in term in
8:05 terms of skills um yep after you know it
8:07 really depends because uh in data
8:10 science um
8:12 you have like a lot of um
8:15 you know because yeah you have like data
8:17 analysts to call themselves data
8:18 scientists and vice versa um uh so yeah
8:22 for me like a data scientist i would say
8:24 like who will for example work on like
8:25 future engineering etc um so yeah so
8:29 yeah you don't have like the same uh
8:30 like uh ratio between like tech and uh
8:34 business in terms of skills
8:36 um the other thing is really that
8:39 you have this um we've seen in the last
8:43 uh like at least five six years
8:45 um like uh
8:48 like a very
8:49 big hype on like data science um
8:53 so we've seen it was like one of the
8:54 hottest jobs uh like we saw we see like
8:57 plenty of like like what's the like the
8:59 more like high demand job uh like in the
9:01 market um so yes so
9:04 the difference i would say is that for
9:07 data science role um yeah basically i
9:10 just i have like plenty of applications
9:12 um so yes
9:14 because yeah it's you have like this um
9:16 like this hype for data engineering um
9:19 it's it's less the case to me it starts
9:21 to be
9:22 like hype um
9:25 yeah but to me this is also like
9:27 something that is in the natural order
9:29 of things um really because when you
9:31 have like companies massively hired like
9:33 data scientists in the last years
9:36 and now they and like some of them you
9:38 know kind of like realize that yeah
9:40 maybe
9:41 it could be like a good idea to have
9:43 like
9:43 engineers that will deal with the data
9:46 you know and uh i would say and data
9:48 pipelines and all these parts
9:51 um so yeah so
9:53 so to me this is really like in the
9:54 natural order of things
9:57 the other thing really is that
10:00 we also have seen
10:02 a lot of i would say um
10:05 like universities and engineering school
10:08 providing
10:09 like data science specific uh
10:12 like training and diplomas
10:15 which is
10:16 not well not at the same level i would
10:18 say like nowadays um so so i'm not sure
10:21 there's
10:22 that many
10:23 well i would say like like purely data
10:26 engineering like bachelor degrees or
10:28 master degrees um i mean like not yet so
10:31 yeah so if it follows the same trend as
10:35 data scientists
10:36 this should happen
10:38 like pretty soon
10:39 uh um so um yeah
10:42 so yeah so for me that's i would select
10:43 the
10:45 two different
10:46 uh yeah one is like much much more
10:49 you know uh
10:50 hype than the other one
10:53 so yeah and because yeah we don't have
10:54 like
10:55 necessarily like a
10:57 formal training for being a data
10:59 engineer you know i'm sure it's going to
11:01 happen you know but uh yeah have to be a
11:03 bit patient
11:05 yeah i think data science was quite uh
11:09 how to say romantized or like it was
11:12 like this is the perfect job where all
11:14 you do is do machine learning yeah like
11:16 it was a yeah this is the job of the
11:18 sensory you know and like like machine
11:21 learning ai etc and
11:23 but yeah but like in the ants like
11:25 if you don't have data and you don't
11:27 have you know like if it's not well i
11:30 would say like organize and you don't
11:32 take you know like a good care of like
11:34 the pipelines and the data
11:36 like data science you know that's you
11:38 know you can
11:40 you know it's yeah because i mean like
11:42 data is kind of it's yeah it's it's like
11:44 the um
11:46 like the the key you know for data
11:47 science so
11:49 if it's so yeah sorry so that's why you
11:51 know they just ask like oh yeah we need
11:52 professionals to handle these parts
11:54 yes so
11:57 to summarize what i heard from you so
11:58 the first thing is that there is this
12:00 balance between technology technology
12:02 and business so you see more business in
12:05 data science also rather than like you
12:08 know
12:09 compared to data engineering roles and
12:11 then the second thing data science is
12:13 pretty much still hyped so you see a lot
12:15 more applications for data science roles
12:18 yeah while for the engineering positions
12:20 uh the moment you open you
12:23 receive less applications so there are
12:25 less competition right
12:27 yeah and and maybe
12:29 and maybe people they
12:31 like candidates that they know
12:33 a bit less about data engineering than
12:36 like data science that's right because
12:38 as you said you know like you have like
12:40 all this like storytelling and you know
12:42 like this kind of like communication and
12:45 you know and especially like some
12:46 companies that say oh yeah we're doing
12:47 like we're doing like machine learning
12:49 we're doing ai and
12:50 in the end it's just like some like if
12:52 and else you know and not like really
12:54 you know like like a very advanced uh
12:56 models so yeah so you also had this kind
12:59 of like marketing
13:00 things that's kind of um you know same
13:02 for schools you know in university so
13:04 like yeah we have a brand new like
13:07 uh data science degree you know so yeah
13:10 so they they kind of like played with
13:12 this
13:14 have you observed the spike of interest
13:17 in data engineering roles recently
13:20 i am judging from the blog posts i see
13:22 on the internet for a year maybe a bit
13:25 longer i have seen posts on like hacker
13:28 news and in general
13:29 internet on social media
13:31 that
13:32 like you don't need data scientists you
13:34 need data engineers so people companies
13:37 they realize that data engineers are
13:39 actually needed they are in demand
13:42 and more people
13:43 this way learned about this role so have
13:46 you seen a spike of interest in data
13:48 engineering roles um
13:50 yeah so i would say
13:52 um yeah definitely um we've been we've
13:55 seen like more and more content by like
13:57 people who are like sharing about like
13:59 what they're doing
14:01 um you know but yeah for me that's also
14:04 um
14:05 a trend i would say that like the big
14:07 tech companies um you know like i would
14:10 say like started because
14:12 yeah basically when i said i like the
14:14 beach like uh you have like all the like
14:15 the like the fun companies where
14:18 they were one of the first you know to
14:20 process a huge amount you know of of
14:23 data and be able to like process a lot
14:26 of them and to analyze a lot of data as
14:28 well
14:29 and in parliament we've seen that
14:31 there were
14:32 more and more
14:33 tools
14:35 that were available i would say in the
14:37 market uh open source ones or like
14:39 proprietary ones that just were like
14:43 helping as well you know to
14:45 uh like to process more to analyze more
14:48 um so yeah so yep so this definitely
14:50 also like helped i would say um yeah
14:53 then you have like
14:54 all like the cloud computing parts and
14:57 it's like you have like the like hadoop
14:58 ecosystem so we seemed this and so and
15:01 so we continue to have like more and
15:02 more um like tools as well to uh to
15:06 automate
15:07 uh yeah i mean like before the
15:09 technology is like progressing
15:11 a lot it seems and even like the data
15:13 engineering job is is changing as well
15:16 because before you are doing a lot of
15:18 things i would say like manually
15:21 but i'll say like from a certain
15:23 amount of data or if you have like very
15:25 complex data
15:26 you know so yeah so that's why you have
15:27 like all this ecosystem you know what um
15:30 i would say very um
15:32 uh
15:33 like yeah it's like very like used a lot
15:36 i would say
15:38 um so yeah but yeah yeah so yeah so yeah
15:42 also also this
15:43 you also have like a change of i would
15:46 say like some work you know and some
15:48 amazon jobs as well you know so yeah
15:51 well you have like more
15:53 more automation and
15:55 more
15:56 optimization as well in terms of process
15:59 i'm wondering as a recruiter who
16:02 recruits for data engineering roles in
16:04 general for technical roles how much of
16:07 this stuff do you need to know you seem
16:09 to know quite a lot already because
16:11 we're talking um already about quite
16:13 technical topics with you
16:15 so
16:17 like do you need to know things like
16:18 what is etl what is i don't know cloud
16:21 computing what is spark what is fling uh
16:24 what is python what is uh you mentioned
16:27 like that it's not ai it's a bunch of if
16:29 then uh yeah
16:31 like as a recruiter how much of this do
16:34 you actually need to know to be
16:36 successful um
16:37 yeah okay so first of all i say it
16:39 depends on on the recruiter you know
16:41 like for me uh to me i'm you know so
16:44 yeah i really so yeah i'm like i'm
16:46 passionate about technology and each
16:48 time i'm talking with like someone or
16:50 engineer and i have like some stuff i
16:53 no i never
16:54 um i don't know uh yeah i just always
16:57 ask uh why so i'm just also like curious
16:59 by nature but i would say the
17:01 for me it's important to know the
17:04 the concepts
17:06 so um if um so yeah so for example it
17:10 helps really to reduce i would say the
17:14 um
17:14 i would say the number of candidates
17:17 shook in a sense to a like hiring
17:19 manager without the relevant experience
17:22 so
17:23 from for example um i know what's
17:26 computing i know i would say the big
17:28 picture how it works i would say but
17:30 more the on the high level
17:32 uh yeah if you like you know like ask me
17:34 like exactly like the in your details
17:37 etc um like yeah i don't know because
17:39 this is not my job
17:41 uh yes but yeah but to understand um
17:44 you know uh yeah to have the big picture
17:48 it helps me really to
17:51 spot like very quickly if someone
17:54 experience is relevant for the job or
17:57 for the
17:58 for the project um so yeah it also helps
18:02 me for example when i to receive some
18:05 resumes for example i say oh i'm not
18:07 sure this candidate would fit or match
18:11 in this part of our this role or this
18:14 part of our
18:15 tech organization
18:17 but this candidate might be interesting
18:18 for another another you know so so yeah
18:21 sorry i mean
18:23 so yeah so i would say yes it's
18:25 it's better and yeah also you have some
18:27 um some credibility as well you know
18:29 because if you if you um imagine if
18:32 you're like an engineer and shoot actual
18:34 recruiter who doesn't know like anything
18:35 like even like the basics i would say
18:39 yeah so you also have this
18:40 image you know and credibility
18:43 that is also important in my opinion
18:47 so in your opinion what are the main
18:50 difficulties what are the main
18:51 challenges
18:52 of hiring data engineers
18:55 um
18:56 so there's
18:58 what sorry as i was mentioning before
19:01 there's there's no i would say
19:03 formal like
19:05 training i would say like yeah
19:07 i would say like dipromus so if you
19:10 look
19:11 if you're looking for someone like who
19:13 is senior
19:14 generally
19:15 you're going to have candidates and
19:18 engineers
19:20 who are coming from i would say software
19:23 engineering
19:24 um rbi
19:26 or from like some of the roles yeah so i
19:29 i've seen some
19:31 engineers some of them coming from like
19:33 data science and they
19:35 realized after a couple of years you
19:37 know i said like oh yeah actually i like
19:39 the the data piece you know more than
19:42 like like the rest so yeah so yeah so i
19:44 would say that that's one of the
19:45 challenge
19:46 um
19:48 yeah
19:49 i mean i think it's also like the second
19:51 one which is it's pretty classic um
19:53 because suzhou market but it's very high
19:56 demand
19:57 um yeah the thing that is i would say
20:00 bits
20:02 um term yeah so yeah i would say
20:05 yeah should you have like a lot of
20:07 jobs as well who are
20:10 like close
20:11 to data engineering
20:13 but that are not data engineering in the
20:16 sense of
20:17 what data engineers are working on right
20:19 now
20:20 so yeah so yeah so sometimes you can
20:21 have like someone that who is like very
20:23 senior you know but
20:25 like hasn't uh said i've worked on i
20:28 would say the classic data engineering
20:30 uh
20:31 problems that you can have
20:33 um so yeah so that for me that that's i
20:36 would say the the difficulty
20:38 uh yeah so yeah so you really have to
20:41 see and um understand what the candidate
20:45 is doing and what they
20:47 what they want to do you know like in
20:49 the future
20:50 um so yeah so yeah so yeah yeah
20:53 that's the
20:55 main difficulty i would say
20:57 so i imagine that you get a bunch of
20:59 applications or you reach out to a bunch
21:01 of people who are not only
21:03 who do not maybe yet have title of data
21:06 engineer in their
21:07 exactly yeah
21:08 like a data scientist a bi engineer
21:11 software engineer and
21:13 it seems like they are doing something
21:15 relevant but you need to find out if
21:17 this is actually
21:18 right so if they are already imaging a
21:20 lot of software engineers already are
21:22 building data pipelines they just don't
21:24 know that they are doing the engineering
21:26 yeah yeah exactly and if we can i mean
21:28 like there's
21:29 you can do like a parallel with like
21:30 data science as well so you have
21:33 people well
21:34 as a title it's like data science but
21:37 they are only like doing like r or
21:39 matlab for example you're like r and sql
21:42 you know so um you know and then so
21:45 yeah um
21:47 but yeah that's that's one of the
21:49 reasons so yeah i would say the job
21:50 title also is
21:53 but i it's important but it's really
21:55 about the
21:57 to me
21:58 the most important thing really is what
22:00 you are doing
22:02 on the job and the kind of project you
22:03 are working on
22:05 uh yeah because
22:06 as you said you know i've seen some
22:08 people with like software engineering
22:10 title
22:11 and they've been working on like on like
22:13 like hadoop and like a combo of like
22:15 hadoop sparks kada stuff um and so like
22:18 yeah it's it is software engineering but
22:21 you could have called yourself a data
22:23 engineer
22:25 it's the same you know that's if you're
22:28 you have like some people who call
22:29 themselves like bi engineer but they are
22:31 doing data engineering um uh so so
22:34 hopefully you know we like the more
22:35 we're gonna talk about data engineering
22:37 the more training the more blog posts
22:39 etc um i do hope that people will
22:42 realize that oh but in the end uh i'm
22:44 doing data engineering you know uh so
22:47 yeah so yeah yeah so i think there's a
22:49 bit of branding you know also to you
22:52 know to um to make i would say
22:55 and do you
22:57 think there are a lot of differences
22:59 between hiring junior data engineers
23:02 middle level data engineers and senior
23:04 engineers as uh
23:07 uh yes so definitely um so junior
23:11 engineers
23:12 are um i would say they are very like i
23:15 would say task oriented
23:17 so uh when you start working as
23:21 a data engineer you know gonna talk to
23:24 the team so they'll say okay we have you
23:26 know this you know project on this task
23:29 you know and you're gonna do it
23:31 when you move to
23:33 someone who's let's say like a
23:35 intermediate level um
23:37 so they are not only i would say
23:40 task oriented but they are uh they are
23:42 more proactive um in a sense that
23:45 um yeah at this level they have like a
23:48 pretty good understanding of programming
23:50 they're able to make
23:52 like some like design decisions they can
23:54 manage
23:55 some project and
23:57 ambiguity you know when you have like
23:59 some like complexification and some
24:01 complex uh things
24:03 so in the end they start to work i would
24:05 say
24:07 they start taking sorry on them on their
24:09 own projects
24:11 also yeah it really also depends on the
24:14 the size of the company you look for the
24:16 type of the company you work for
24:18 so yeah so yep so they might have
24:21 some focus on designing uh like new
24:24 products or to improve some some like
24:27 system flows for example
24:29 um but uh yeah let's see if and for
24:32 for senior when you're when you're like
24:34 a senior data engineer of course you
24:36 have like the skills okay so you you
24:39 should have like you have the um expert
24:41 the technical expertise
24:43 um but
24:45 these
24:46 with i would say the number of years of
24:48 experience
24:50 you know uh
24:52 you have
24:53 basically you you're able to manage
24:56 a
24:57 bunch of uh
24:59 project so you have like better reflex
25:01 for example and not what you do for like
25:04 depending on this case or this or you
25:07 know this technical like situation so
25:10 yeah basically it's just like with the
25:13 multiplication of
25:14 the like the trial and the error you
25:17 made uh so like oh yeah i remember i
25:20 think that's pretty good all like here
25:22 you know like i've did that pretty
25:23 poorly you know so yeah so yeah so i
25:26 have the this um this part and of course
25:28 to finish you have the uh the influence
25:31 so influence on i would say the
25:33 technical decision you know influence on
25:36 also like the way of doing things and
25:38 the influence on the i would say the
25:41 more uh i would say the less senior uh
25:44 data engineer so yeah so yeah so this is
25:47 also like a grow also in the um in the
25:49 uh influence
25:51 zone i would say for you like when you
25:54 actually recruit them when you they go
25:56 through the recruitment process and they
25:58 imagine at the beginning they have a
25:59 call with you the recruiter
26:01 actual uh you know
26:04 call with recruiter the initial the
26:05 first stage of the interview
26:07 i imagine that for each of these levels
26:10 you would have a different approach
26:11 right so yes juniors are more
26:13 task-oriented then maybe you would just
26:16 ask about
26:17 things they did the
26:20 like technologies they know
26:22 maybe for intermediate level you maybe
26:24 would ask about cases when they showed
26:27 this proactiveness you talked about when
26:28 they uh made a design decision right and
26:31 then for senior you would ask them how
26:33 they um
26:35 showed this influence you talked about
26:37 right is it correct um yeah so the goal
26:39 really is like on a recruitment process
26:42 you have like a framework okay so the
26:45 process is the same i would say
26:48 but of course you do not expect the same
26:51 whether you're like a junior or a senior
26:53 uh engineer
26:55 i would say for a for junior candidates
26:58 yes um
26:59 i mean
27:00 so yeah so what i've seen in general in
27:03 terms of recruitment process
27:05 you have let's say
27:07 three
27:09 let's say you have like different steps
27:10 of course you always have like a in
27:12 intro goal with a recruiter here it's
27:15 more about getting to to know each other
27:17 you know it's like what uh what are you
27:20 working on right now
27:21 uh what the company a recruit for is you
27:24 know is is doing etc
27:26 then um usually depends on companies but
27:29 you have a first um
27:32 you have a first uh discussion with
27:34 someone from the data engineering team
27:36 so yeah so here it's more about to
27:38 to um to more talk i would say a bit
27:41 more in details on the candidate's uh
27:44 current project um
27:46 so yeah and after you have this mix of
27:48 technical interviews well generally you
27:50 have like a coding
27:52 i would say coding interview
27:55 um that of course coding interview where
27:57 it's you know it's um
27:59 like data oriented
28:01 here
28:03 and so um
28:05 yeah and
28:06 the last one is generally like a bit
28:07 more i would say practical analytical i
28:09 would say i would say exercise but yeah
28:12 for example when
28:15 if you start as a as a junior data
28:17 engineer and you talk to someone from
28:19 from a
28:21 like with the hiring manager for example
28:23 um
28:25 something that is like important is also
28:27 to to care about the business um so
28:30 yeah because
28:32 data engineers you talk with uh like
28:36 like different kind of like stakeholders
28:38 and you also have to understand um i'm
28:40 saying like the the business
28:42 um so yeah so that that's one of them i
28:44 think of of course the more senior
28:48 you are for example you would be able on
28:51 any technical disk um
28:54 like questionable or discussion
28:56 to be able to say
28:59 why would you do it
29:00 this way and not that way
29:04 what would be the the drawbacks you know
29:07 and what would be you know you know and
29:09 the benefits to
29:11 to be able to explain um the different
29:13 trade-offs you know
29:16 also trade-offs also in terms of
29:18 i would say
29:20 i would say time
29:22 uh
29:23 you know
29:24 time money you know performance as well
29:27 so
29:28 so yeah so the more senior you are and
29:29 the more you tackle all these problems
29:31 and you can say oh for this kind of uh
29:33 problem i would go for
29:35 this solution and explain why why this
29:38 solution you know but also to say okay
29:42 this solution might work but you might
29:45 have some like drawbacks and some
29:47 bottlenecks and so you have to be aware
29:49 of of all this
29:50 of course it is not something that you
29:52 can necessarily ask for someone who is i
29:54 would say who just started the job uh
29:56 because um yeah
29:58 the goal really is to multiply i would
30:00 say
30:01 the i would say the uh the technical
30:04 challenge you know that you found during
30:06 your career and the more you just
30:10 tackle them and
30:12 the best you will have reflects on like
30:14 oh yeah already has a similar problem
30:17 now i know what to do
30:18 so yeah so yeah so that's the
30:20 so so basically
30:22 what we do expect from junior
30:24 intermediate senior
30:25 has to reflect i would say on what we
30:28 ask i would say during the recruitment
30:31 process
30:32 so yeah so you have like a very you have
30:34 a parallel let's say between between the
30:36 two
30:37 uh i would say there is a related
30:40 question so we talked about different
30:42 levels
30:43 talking about people who are switching
30:45 to data engineering
30:47 and
30:48 what are you looking for what do you
30:50 look in
30:51 um
30:52 what do you look for in these people so
30:55 i think you mentioned one thing so for
30:56 people who
30:58 are just starting their career in data
30:59 engineering so they need to
31:02 care about the business do some research
31:04 about the domain of the company that
31:07 they interview for right are there other
31:09 things you look for in these candidates
31:11 who are just uh getting started in
31:13 database
31:15 um so
31:16 yeah so exactly so yeah that's several
31:20 several things um
31:22 first i would say the
31:25 if you okay so it helps a lot if you
31:28 have done uh internships for example um
31:30 so that's a good way to start
31:33 yeah now also you have i would say
31:36 you start to have a lot of online
31:39 trainings uh whether it's on some like
31:41 different technologies uh you know also
31:43 like
31:44 i would say the basic uh like data
31:46 engineering uh use cases uh yeah so that
31:49 this is first like a good start
31:51 uh for a junior
31:53 um
31:54 candidates
31:55 i would say so yeah so i'm taking on
31:58 technical skills i don't necessarily
32:01 need someone who's going to put on their
32:04 resume you know like 40 or 50 you know
32:06 like different skills you know i put
32:09 like um yeah also
32:12 quite so i guess so i prefer to have
32:14 like a reduced number of
32:17 technologies and tools that you used but
32:20 that you really used and you kind of
32:21 like
32:22 uh
32:23 yeah you can just say like
32:25 if someone asks you let's have you asked
32:27 you a question about
32:28 this or this tool like yeah you should
32:30 be able to you know to to answer so
32:33 basically for on on a resume for data
32:36 engineering of course you have like sql
32:38 uh python so
32:40 to me this is like i would say like the
32:42 like the bar minimum
32:43 uh yeah and also like yeah in
32:46 terms of projects
32:48 um yeah i mean like if i put myself in
32:51 the shoes of the candidates
32:53 it's really important to do a balance
32:55 for example on whether it's like your
32:57 resume or linkedin
32:59 um to have like the right balance
33:01 between um like no details you know and
33:05 too much information okay so yeah
33:07 because recruiters were kind of like
33:09 lazy okay so so we so so we like you
33:11 know um like to
33:13 to read quickly to go like straight to
33:15 the to the point so yeah so i do check
33:18 um
33:19 uh projects whether it's like internship
33:22 or um
33:23 or project that you've done
33:25 on your own
33:26 um so yeah and also the thing that is
33:28 important is like the
33:30 if you're done like an internship
33:31 whether it's like a startup or like a
33:33 bigger company like yeah what kind of
33:36 problems and what kind of data you've
33:38 been dealing with as well
33:41 yeah in general i would say except some
33:44 companies but the data engineering
33:47 problems
33:48 look very similar
33:52 the exception is when you have
33:56 a massive uh
33:58 amount of data so here it complicates
34:01 things okay so it's a bit more specific
34:03 uh yeah so for example
34:05 if you go back to like companies like um
34:07 like like radio for example
34:09 like the amount of data is like huge uh
34:12 so here it was like pretty specific uh
34:14 yeah but here for example like on fino
34:16 we have like less data but the core data
34:19 are i would say
34:21 uh
34:22 price it's like privacy is like at the
34:24 core you know of you know and like
34:26 privacy and security in general is at
34:27 the core of the you know of the data so
34:29 yeah so yeah so yeah so if there's
34:31 anything i would say like specific
34:34 uh as well
34:35 um so yeah so that that's the main thing
34:37 that i'm that i'm uh looking at uh jerry
34:40 i i don't pay
34:42 that much attention to the to the title
34:44 maybe i'm one of them
34:47 but um yeah so yeah so yeah let's
34:50 say be precise you know and to have like
34:53 some details and say like okay the
34:55 company is doing this i've worked on
34:58 this project i've used this tool that
35:00 was the problem i know and you know and
35:03 this was the outcome
35:06 yeah so speaking of titles so you just
35:08 said you just mentioned that you don't
35:10 really care about titles but i imagine
35:12 that right now
35:14 many data scientists many software
35:16 engineers bi engineers data analysts
35:20 they see this
35:23 interest in data engineering roles
35:26 they see this demand for data
35:27 engineering roles and they want to
35:29 switch right and then
35:31 for these people who already have
35:33 experience
35:34 maybe several years of experience maybe
35:36 even more than five years for experience
35:38 working in i.t in this
35:41 in these roles so they are not starting
35:43 really from scratch like compared to
35:45 let's say somebody fresh out of
35:46 university
35:48 so do you think they should also apply
35:50 for junior positions like let's say
35:52 somebody who works as a data scientist
35:54 or maybe they should go directly to like
35:56 just a usual intermediate or
35:59 data engineer um no so if you're someone
36:03 who is let's say if you have like a lot
36:06 of years of experiences i would say like
36:08 back and food stack or like pi in
36:11 engineering
36:12 um
36:13 yeah no i think you you can target i
36:16 would say
36:17 um like
36:18 uh i mean say not sure like a like a
36:21 junior role um so yeah so yeah to me the
36:24 thing that is very important is like
36:27 when you apply as well is to see
36:30 how's the team okay because
36:33 if you know you
36:36 it happens you know once you start you
36:39 know and you just
36:41 start in the company of like 10 years
36:43 experience but not necessarily related
36:44 to like data engineering
36:46 you know and then they will be like the
36:48 one handling all of the data piece
36:51 here might be like complicated you know
36:53 but uh you know um so yeah um yeah i
36:57 would say yeah
36:58 um
36:59 there's a lot of um
37:01 um
37:03 most companies i would say i would say
37:04 like when you have like startups and
37:06 that's not the one we like particularly
37:09 um like huge
37:12 amount of data or privacy i was like
37:14 saying um yeah the
37:16 the projects are and the way
37:19 data engineering is done
37:23 doesn't change that much it seems um
37:26 so um yeah so that's yeah i mean like
37:30 yeah you gotta start
37:32 i would say somewhere but i would say
37:34 the first thing is really go and see you
37:37 know on and check on on the internet uh
37:40 also like
37:42 like how do we handle i would say
37:44 uh like these cases you know uh and this
37:47 kind of uh projects to start uh having
37:50 your own um
37:52 reflex as well so like oh yeah for this
37:55 kind of problem i've already tried uh
37:57 i've seen some cheetos and videos uh
37:59 sorry yeah yeah so yeah yeah but also
38:02 advice so because i saw that so you have
38:04 a webinar coming cathy in may so yeah so
38:07 yeah so this uh
38:09 hopefully will be useful to you for uh
38:12 to get more insight
38:13 but yeah no i would say
38:15 just go i would say for data engineering
38:18 um
38:19 be
38:20 three things you have to keep in mind um
38:23 now data engineering uh it's python
38:25 mostly i would say so if you're uh like
38:29 get yourself into into into python
38:32 uh if you're like a coder more of a
38:35 coder you know also just check on like
38:38 uh like sequence
38:39 you can see on like different uh
38:41 like tools that are kind of you know so
38:44 yeah so you kind of have like like a
38:45 tableau looker and all those things
38:49 um so um yeah and also care about care
38:52 about the business that's why you know
38:54 because data engineering is not only
38:56 like oh yeah i'm just like coding and
38:57 doing like some like tech stuff but
38:59 you're gonna talk with data analysts and
39:01 you're gonna talk with like bi people
39:04 analytics etc because you kind of like
39:07 serve i would say um
39:09 a bit more the business
39:11 so yeah so yeah but that would be like
39:14 my advanced uh sql pythons the basics of
39:17 data engineering and also like care
39:19 about the business because you have an
39:21 impact as a data engineer on the on the
39:23 business
39:24 uh yeah because after you know the data
39:27 are used by data centers business
39:28 analysts uh it can be
39:30 sales um
39:32 so yeah so if you know so yeah so you
39:33 have to always have in your mind that
39:36 uh these people will um
39:38 you know rely on you
39:40 basically and how important for data
39:44 engineers to know tools like you know
39:46 cloud
39:47 uh like aws google cloud
39:51 platform and others
39:53 is it i think probably most of the jobs
39:56 at least from what i see in berlin most
39:57 of the jobs require that to some extent
40:00 or at least
40:02 this yeah so what you see
40:04 um
40:05 yeah i mean
40:07 to me this um
40:11 i mean
40:12 generally and there is
40:14 i mean like for the companies i i've
40:16 been uh i've worked for
40:18 uh we were mostly like tech agnostic so
40:22 for example like for cloud if the
40:24 company is using gcp and you only know
40:26 like aws um i mean that's fine i mean
40:29 you just know how cloud computing works
40:31 and i think that's that's the most
40:33 important thing you know yeah and it's
40:35 the same for you know like if you if you
40:36 used like looker and not tableau okay
40:39 it's it's different but you have like
40:41 some you know
40:42 stuff that are similar you know as well
40:44 so yeah so yeah so for me you don't have
40:46 to
40:48 know all of the technologies you know so
40:50 um you have to understand how how they
40:53 are used and why
40:55 then you have just like a bunch of
40:57 difference with a different
40:58 feature that's that they have um so for
41:01 me it's not like really important
41:03 uh yeah but yeah but of course if you if
41:05 you stay if you
41:07 if you say on your resume oh yeah i'm an
41:09 expert with like like tableau and i know
41:12 tableau
41:12 like yeah so yeah you should be able
41:14 that okay maybe the toyota's gonna ask
41:16 you a specific question about tableau so
41:18 like you should you know be able to uh
41:20 to kind of like uh
41:22 uh answer you know so yeah so just like
41:24 don't pretend you're unlike an expert
41:26 you know and you've used like like all
41:28 the tools etc you know because yeah i
41:31 mean like no one's like a superhuman or
41:33 at least you know you just like hide it
41:34 you know
41:35 but um yeah so yeah so yeah so for me no
41:38 not that important but um yeah if you
41:40 have used similar ones i mean um and
41:43 that you really used and you have like
41:45 knowledge about
41:46 this is the most important thing really
41:50 and then the question goes on is
41:52 like
41:53 how important is to know
41:55 infrastructure tools and then by this i
41:57 think
41:58 they mean tools like kubernetes or
42:00 setting up different databases like i
42:02 don't know
42:03 like whatever we use for data pipelines
42:06 um like these tools like you know
42:09 kubernetes terraform
42:10 uh
42:11 yeah
42:12 is it something you also
42:15 look for in candidates or this is maybe
42:18 secondary
42:20 um
42:21 it really depends on the um on your
42:23 organization
42:25 so
42:26 here for example
42:27 we do have devops engineers and um so
42:31 yeah so they are like specifically
42:33 working on i would say the cloud
42:34 platform you know and they i'll say i'm
42:36 on um so yeah so yeah
42:39 if of course you join a smaller company
42:42 you know like data engineer you know if
42:44 you don't have
42:46 like devops for example
42:48 you know um you know data engineers
42:50 might have i would say a broader scope
42:52 um yeah so
42:54 i would say if yeah i would say if
42:56 you're targeting i would say
42:59 uh mid-size to large companies um i'm
43:02 sure this is like very uh important to
43:04 know uh yeah i mean at least to be aware
43:08 of like what it is and
43:10 what is it used for
43:12 uh yeah that's that's the principle the
43:15 the main thing uh really you know but uh
43:17 yeah generally now organization they
43:21 most of the organization they they have
43:23 devops folks you know who are working
43:25 with this you know then after really
43:27 depends on the
43:28 the synergy i would say between like how
43:31 devops and data engineer are working
43:33 together
43:34 so yeah so here also depends on the you
43:36 know on the companies
43:38 it's actually not different for oil
43:40 extra company where i work because we do
43:42 have uh
43:44 devops we don't call them devops but
43:47 there are people who take care of the
43:49 platform stuff so then it's easier for
43:51 us data scientists engineers everyone
43:54 actually just yeah use these things yeah
43:56 and i know i mean it's great because you
43:58 also have machine learning apps for
44:00 example were like the devops yml and um
44:03 yeah but now we also
44:06 we have seen as well um some kind of
44:10 splits because in some organization you
44:12 have data engineers but you have like bi
44:14 engineers and analytics engineers um so
44:17 it depends we also on the organization
44:19 because it's our organization
44:21 you'll just go like a data engineer and
44:23 doing a bit of like the three you know
44:25 and so yeah so also depends on the um
44:27 let's say on the like on the companies
44:29 and how they split and organize
44:31 themselves really
44:34 yeah another question what would you
44:36 recommend to job applicants that job
44:38 applicants do before talking to a
44:40 recruiter or a hiring oh yeah uh okay
44:44 i'm gonna repeat myself again but uh
44:45 yeah so uh
44:47 i care about the business so i've seen
44:50 sorry so
44:51 also like as a request so i hate i would
44:53 say i always plan
44:55 uh um intro call with candidates whether
44:58 they're blind or if i reach out to them
45:01 i just ask you know like okay so yeah so
45:03 it's i never call by surprise so first
45:06 you know i've seen this and it's
45:08 honestly this is really bad but that's
45:10 yeah um
45:12 i've talked to someone who had like
45:13 absolutely like no clue about what the
45:15 company was doing you know so yeah so i
45:18 mean i
45:19 so yeah so we have some i would say yeah
45:21 so
45:23 so how to prepare um
45:26 see and and check you know on the
45:29 business and the product of course the
45:31 goal is
45:32 like it's not
45:34 you don't have to know perfectly about
45:36 like the business or the product okay
45:37 but at least to
45:39 to you know to um like understand okay
45:42 what's the problem that the company is
45:44 trying to solve you know after if you
45:46 have like any specific questions about
45:49 uh you know the like the product or the
45:51 business or the reputator will be here
45:53 to give you like more details and more
45:54 insights
45:55 okay uh yeah also um like personally i
45:59 also like ask also like the
46:01 kind of the same questions each time you
46:03 know is um yeah so yeah so i already
46:06 asked uh how did they heard about the
46:08 company you know so if they heard about
46:10 the company before uh uh if yes like how
46:14 if if no how you know same
46:17 um
46:19 yeah and also it's like yeah to be able
46:21 to
46:22 and yeah this is also useful for
46:24 obviously data engineering uh process
46:26 but to be able to explain
46:28 uh the project you've worked on
46:31 okay and like currently or like in the
46:33 past but being able to
46:35 explain it
46:36 to let's say a non-technical person
46:39 okay sorry so maybe i i might be like a
46:42 bit more technical some than some uh
46:44 like recruiters yeah but that's also
46:46 something that is um very important to
46:48 uh to train so just to train
46:51 talking a bit more about about yourself
46:53 you know about like this is what i've
46:55 done uh this is the project i've worked
46:58 on this was the challenge um yeah and
47:01 also say like why did you
47:04 also too yeah like why did you apply
47:06 like or if it was a reach out like why
47:08 like why are we talking right now so
47:11 yeah so like so yeah so if you have any
47:13 specific career exploration um you know
47:16 um things that uh you want to learn so
47:19 yes this is important to uh you know to
47:21 share
47:22 um so yeah so yeah there's generally
47:24 there's no like very technical uh
47:26 distribution with a recruiter it's
47:27 pretty high level
47:29 uh but yeah but some candidates might be
47:32 not that comfortable talking about
47:35 themselves what they've done you know
47:38 and what they would like to do you know
47:41 so yeah
47:42 yeah i have done this mistake of not
47:44 preparing well to introduce so
47:47 you know there's this strategy of just
47:50 praying and praying i did like a couple
47:53 of years ago so i would just go to
47:55 linkedin and other websites i would just
47:57 apply to everything
47:59 standard cover letter the same cv and
48:01 then of course some recruiters were
48:03 answering me and then i had a call with
48:06 one of the recruiters yeah they told me
48:08 like the first thing okay tell us what
48:10 do you know about us and i was like
48:12 exactly so i i always ask this question
48:17 you know i always ask this question i
48:19 always ask
48:21 yeah like what do you know about the
48:22 company just tell me everything that you
48:24 know and if there's something that is
48:26 like like not true needs to be you know
48:29 um then then i will complete and give
48:30 you like more details
48:32 um yeah because also like if you
48:35 especially as a data engineer but if you
48:37 apply to a company where
48:40 the business or the product looks
48:42 particularly interesting
48:44 to you um that this is a huge plus you
48:46 know because when you're gonna start
48:48 talking with a data engineer manager for
48:51 example and you say like oh yeah i've
48:53 used your product or you know i think
48:55 the product is pretty it's pretty cool
48:57 et cetera you know it shows that you do
48:58 care about the business and in the end
49:00 it's know uh yeah
49:02 i mean generally speaking it's it's
49:03 positive but it's a it's a positive
49:06 thing definitely so
49:07 the end of that story wasn't very
49:09 positive because they asked okay can you
49:11 remind your name again like the name of
49:13 the company so that was already like and
49:16 then
49:16 after she told me the name i thought uh
49:19 sorry i don't remember what you actually
49:21 do and then of course needless to say
49:23 they didn't call me and they didn't
49:24 write back after that
49:26 interview so and that for me if the
49:28 lesson was okay maybe instead of you
49:30 know just applying to everything i see
49:33 maybe i should take a little bit of time
49:35 i don't know actually yeah and really
49:37 like like a target really like the uh
49:39 the company starts looks interesting
49:41 whether it's like the business or the
49:43 product or like the kind of data so are
49:45 you like um i'm not seeking for like a
49:48 company where you have a
49:50 like big amounts of data
49:53 or if it's like more okay like less
49:55 amount of data but
49:57 like more i would say like privacy
49:59 oriented
50:00 for example you know or like very um you
50:03 know if you want to deal with like
50:06 data from like healthcare e-commerce
50:08 financial so yeah if you have any
50:11 specific interest in that one of the
50:12 domain you know you can also uh you know
50:14 um help you know a target you know yeah
50:17 but also it's
50:19 thing that can that can help as well is
50:21 to um is to
50:23 is to network so you have like all the
50:24 community so
50:26 go and listen to people you know uh
50:29 whether they're like data like like data
50:31 engineering um read articles and then
50:34 you're gonna force your own opinion on
50:36 like oh yeah these kind of problems
50:38 super interesting yeah and then you
50:40 target the right uh the right companies
50:44 what would you say about people without
50:47 a formal computer science degree
50:50 would you hire somebody without
50:52 this formal degree but with a set of
50:55 data engineering projects
50:57 um yeah so i'm going to be very clear i
51:00 don't care if you have a diploma or not
51:02 as long as you have the skills okay and
51:05 and the experience so yeah so
51:07 yeah i mean like
51:09 as long as you as you learned i've hired
51:11 some of the self-taught engineers and i
51:14 remember i think it was like a couple
51:16 years ago um
51:18 my first company
51:20 i've hired so someone had
51:22 a
51:23 i would say like a more generous
51:24 engineering degree
51:27 and started as a data analyst and this
51:31 person realized that oh
51:34 she got interested in more than like the
51:36 data piece so she kind of like trained
51:37 herself so yeah so if you have like a
51:39 diploma or like a formal education that
51:42 is not exactly outside like a like on
51:44 computer like science uh yeah
51:47 that's one of the things that i found
51:50 like really cool about
51:53 computer science and tech in general is
51:55 that
51:56 generally you not that focused on
51:59 oh yeah this person didn't graduate from
52:01 this or this university oh they just
52:03 have a bachelor you know so yeah i mean
52:06 like you're like in high demand uh if
52:08 you have like the skills you you you
52:10 you show to everyone that uh you've
52:13 learned you know and yeah and you keep
52:15 learning that's also something very
52:17 important just keep learning see if you
52:19 have like if you support like any trance
52:21 any new tones you know so yeah so to be
52:23 like aware because you can be stuck you
52:25 know in like all technologies that you
52:27 use like 10 years ago for example you
52:29 know and then you know yeah because like
52:32 yeah computer science is going fast and
52:34 so yeah so there's always like new stuff
52:35 so yeah so yeah so the degrees it's not
52:38 that doesn't matter but uh yeah just
52:41 uh be aware of like
52:43 like what's the trend i would say you
52:45 know in the market on the technology
52:47 side
52:48 and follow that train
52:51 yeah for me personally the only
52:52 institution that was interested in my
52:55 degree was the foreign
52:57 authority in germany so because like to
52:59 get a
53:00 work permit to get a visa
53:03 there are some
53:04 requirements
53:06 foreigners need to
53:08 uh to pass in order to get the work
53:10 permit right
53:12 and that was the only time i needed
53:14 actually my uh my degree yeah nobody
53:17 else cared about that yeah but but for
53:19 me i mean i'm i'm i've never been a
53:23 like a fan of you know like oh yeah like
53:25 senior it's like
53:27 five years minimum like five years
53:29 experience in this or this technology on
53:31 on this on this role
53:32 no because i mean you can
53:34 you can have like a very senior person
53:37 uh
53:39 with like three years experience you
53:40 know so number of years of experience
53:42 doesn't matter and the
53:44 formal education doesn't matter to me um
53:46 as well so yeah so yeah the only thing
53:48 i'm going to focus is
53:51 skills
53:52 experience and let's say like the
53:54 project you you've been uh working on
53:56 you know like if you if you i don't know
53:58 i have a diploma like in uh finance like
54:01 back in the days i i don't i don't read
54:04 that i just look at the like say in the
54:06 last five years you know like what
54:08 you've done
54:09 and yeah and if it's interesting okay
54:11 then then we'll talk so yeah so yeah so
54:13 that's why you know like when you have
54:14 like errors you may
54:16 give some details not too much you know
54:18 but give you know like straight to the
54:20 point so like this is
54:24 so you mentioned projects like 10 times
54:26 by now do you maybe remember some of the
54:29 projects that really stood out that you
54:31 thought wow cool like this candidate is
54:34 definitely passing the
54:36 i don't know my screen into the next
54:38 step
54:39 um yeah so for example if you um like if
54:42 you uh kind of project uh yeah
54:45 i'm not that technical uh you know
54:48 enough to uh but um oh yeah i mean like
54:51 if you say that okay i've been hired at
54:55 this like startup and i was like one of
54:58 the first like data engineer and we
55:00 started to i would say
55:02 uh work on um i would say like uh
55:06 like building the first like pipelines
55:08 or um you know so
55:11 oh i've learned i for example we've
55:13 built a certain
55:15 like
55:16 data pipeline or data set for a very
55:18 specific
55:20 need
55:21 like or business need for example
55:23 you know or it's um like oh yeah you
55:25 know like with gdpr for example like
55:28 we had to
55:30 remodel you know and change you know
55:32 like the like the system workflow
55:36 for example
55:38 or um yeah
55:40 or for example oh yeah we have we are
55:42 dealing with like private data so i had
55:44 to put in place some data deletion
55:46 systems for example
55:48 this is some stuff that are pretty cool
55:50 you know in the end
55:52 okay so it's not about portfolio it's
55:54 not about public github profile with all
55:57 the projects it's more about what are
55:59 the projects you can talk about to
56:01 recruiter and explain it
56:03 concisely
56:04 in a way that
56:06 any non-technical person would
56:08 understand
56:09 um what the project is about right so
56:11 it's more about having these stories
56:13 prepared for the interview rather than a
56:16 published github profile do you actually
56:17 look at the github profiles of
56:19 candidates um
56:21 so yeah i would say when when candidates
56:24 share the link
56:26 yeah i have a quick look
56:28 um i do believe that my uh
56:31 my colleagues on the data engineering
56:33 sides uh i think they definitely have a
56:35 look
56:37 when you have you when you are like an
56:38 engineer
56:39 but it's the same there's no obligation
56:41 to share anything you just share what
56:43 you want to share
56:45 and yeah and i mean like not everyone
56:47 has for example a passion for like you
56:49 know wants to spend like all their
56:51 weekend for like open source or doing
56:53 like on their own projects as well you
56:54 know so people have lives you know and
56:56 so
56:57 you also have to find the the right
56:59 balance uh but yeah so yeah but
57:01 in the end it's the same for a resume so
57:02 anything that you think
57:04 is worth sharing
57:07 please share
57:08 that's the only one to know so if you
57:09 say that okay i'm not a data engineer
57:12 yet but you know i have uh such i've
57:15 done like uh
57:16 like this online certification i've done
57:19 this one etc
57:20 uh yeah i've seen this kind of like uh
57:23 you know like online degree for example
57:25 and i worked on this project um so yeah
57:27 as long as you're
57:29 after able to talk about it and go into
57:31 the details to engineering uh someone
57:34 from engineering
57:35 put that in your resume you know but you
57:38 should be able to talk about it in the
57:39 details
57:41 uh you know so yeah because sometimes it
57:42 happens like oh yeah i've worked on this
57:44 project
57:46 and when the interview weren't just like
57:48 tip dive for beats they just said like
57:50 oh yeah but no in the end you know there
57:52 were like four people like doing this
57:54 and
57:55 the candidates just touched about
57:57 like this part of the of the project um
58:00 so yeah so
58:02 so yeah
58:04 yeah there is a question from dan so uh
58:07 the question is
58:10 about switching from one industry to
58:12 another
58:14 i'm wondering do you actually look at
58:16 the industry where the candidate works
58:18 in or all you care mostly is like okay
58:22 this person is already data engineer or
58:24 know some data engineering and then only
58:26 after that you look at the industry
58:28 where they work
58:29 no i'm i'm not looking for
58:32 i'm not yeah another specifically
58:33 looking for someone who's specific
58:36 looking in one industry or the other
58:39 some industry can be a bit more i would
58:41 say
58:42 uh interesting for example so if you're
58:44 like in if you're like working like some
58:46 like regulated companies for example um
58:49 you might have i had yeah so yeah banks
58:52 or like odds like trading platforms etc
58:55 or if you're dealing with
58:56 let's say like private data so if you're
58:58 like in the healthcare insurance yeah
59:01 for example this can be like a specific
59:03 set of
59:04 skills i would say more like domain i
59:06 would say knowledge that can be like
59:08 interesting um but um yeah but yeah but
59:11 otherwise no i just look for like the
59:14 like the projects i would say so yeah so
59:17 the industry like really
59:19 unless it's very specific
59:21 uh but um yeah
59:24 yeah william said that
59:27 he really liked our sweaters
59:30 sorry
59:44 not on purpose yeah okay i don't think
59:47 we have time for more questions there
59:49 are still seven questions apologies yeah
59:52 i i think we partly covered some of them
59:55 so not maybe work work but i think like
59:57 maybe no but if there's like any other
59:59 question there's um i've shared like uh
1:00:01 linkedin twitter so
1:00:03 you can send me um any um any any um
1:00:06 any uh questions um yeah for for more i
1:00:10 would say i would say um so yeah so i
1:00:12 would say
1:00:13 i would advise two so i
1:00:16 well i think one was but you have like a
1:00:17 alicia uh
1:00:19 you know podcast as well so she um
1:00:23 she
1:00:24 she shared a lot of very good advice um
1:00:27 you know for like more about like the
1:00:28 like the resume and how to source the
1:00:30 job etc so um so yeah so yeah so you
1:00:33 should have a listen to uh
1:00:35 to uh to the event and the webinar next
1:00:39 month also uh if you really want to to
1:00:42 to deep dive more on the um the
1:00:44 technical side on like actually how i'm
1:00:46 i'm doing it in terms of skills
1:00:48 uh yeah should be uh useful you know so
1:00:51 yeah yeah so yeah you see i i've done a
1:00:53 bit uh some uh some some
1:00:57 should be doing this uh so thanks a lot
1:00:59 for uh yeah
1:01:01 yeah because i kind of feel that some in
1:01:03 between you know in terms of like the
1:01:05 things that i've said uh so yeah so if
1:01:08 you listen to like alicia for like more
1:01:10 on the like hr
1:01:12 and like site
1:01:14 and
1:01:14 i don't remember the name uh
1:01:18 jeff i think jeff jeff uh yeah so it's
1:01:21 more about like concrete so yeah so we
1:01:23 said like with the three of us
1:01:26 that
1:01:27 i hope it would help you yeah yeah
1:01:30 thanks a lot
