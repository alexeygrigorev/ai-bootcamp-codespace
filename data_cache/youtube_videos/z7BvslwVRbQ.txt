0:00 everyone Welcome to our event this event
0:02 is brought to you by databox club which
0:04 is a community of people who love data
0:05 we have weekly events and today we have
0:09 one such events if you want to find out
0:11 more about the events we have there is a
0:13 link in the description go there click
0:15 on this link and you will see I think we
0:18 have two
0:19 workshops in our pipeline yeah so be
0:22 amazing so go pick it up
0:24 then of course do not forget to
0:26 subscribe to our YouTube channel this
0:28 way you will not miss amazing streams
0:31 like we have today and last but not
0:33 least we have a slack Community where it
0:36 can hand out with other data into that
0:37 so if you are not there yet you're
0:40 missing out join the slack and talk to
0:42 other folks during today's interview you
0:45 can ask any question you want there is a
0:47 pint Link in live chat so click on that
0:50 link ask your question and we'll be
0:52 covering these questions
0:56 and now I will stop pairing my screen
0:59 I will open the document that we
1:02 prepared for you
1:04 with the right bio
1:07 and
1:10 I've had many bios over the years yeah
1:13 yeah
1:14 so it's something we found from the
1:16 internet I guess
1:18 so um
1:20 I think I'm ready I think you're ready
1:23 we can start
1:28 I'm I'm so ready born ready no I'm
1:31 kidding
1:33 this week we'll talk about developer
1:35 advocacy and we have a special guest
1:37 today very special Hugo Huga is a head
1:40 of developer relations at outer bounds
1:42 and he's also a host of the banished
1:45 ingredients podcast he's a data
1:47 scientist educator evangelist content
1:49 marketer and data strategy consultant
1:52 she is a very well-known educator he
1:54 developed over 30 courses on the data
1:58 Camp platform probably many of you
2:01 already know his books and with these 30
2:04 curses he managed to impact over 2
2:07 million Learners through
2:08 this through online education so it's a
2:11 big honor to have you today welcome
2:14 thank you so much for having me here
2:16 it's a great honor to to be here and for
2:19 those who don't know um this will go
2:21 live soon but we also recorded
2:23 um an open source demo of metaflow and
2:25 full stack machine learning using the
2:26 sandbox we've built uh recently which
2:28 kind of shows like all the layers of the
2:30 machine learning learning stack and how
2:32 we can interoperate with them so we'll
2:33 chat about that later but we can include
2:35 a link to that in the show notes as well
2:36 so this is a fun week for me and data
2:38 talks Club as well we definitely will do
2:40 this and um not everyone knows that
2:43 outer bounds for example it's not
2:45 obvious for most people that outer
2:47 bounces the company behind metaphor
2:51 is a tool that Hugo is working on yeah
2:55 so we'll get we'll get to that but meta
2:58 flow is a human-centric tool for
2:59 developing full stack machine learning
3:00 applications and software
3:03 um and as a company we support it and
3:04 build software and a platform that that
3:06 supports it and helps people to use it
3:08 so
3:08 I'd have to fire myself if I didn't say
3:10 that so
3:13 questions for today today's interview
3:16 are prepared by Johanna Bayer as always
3:18 thanks Johanna for your help and by the
3:21 way Johanna
3:22 is because Huga is in based in Australia
3:26 and Johanna is based in Australia so
3:28 today Johanna can actually join our
3:30 session live so amazing yeah that's cool
3:34 thank you for all your work
3:36 yeah let's start so before we go into
3:39 our main topic of data developer
3:41 relations let's start with your
3:43 background can you tell us about your
3:45 career Journey so far
3:47 yeah and feel free to stop me at any
3:49 point I'm not quite sure what level of
3:51 granularity to go into but I'll kind of
3:53 give a
3:54 a bit of background that's relevant for
3:57 what we're talking about today as as
3:59 well so my background's in scientific
4:01 research in uh mathematics then cell
4:04 biology and and physics and biophysics
4:07 so studying the physics of the of the
4:10 cell and I was doing that not too far
4:12 from you actually for several years in
4:14 you're in Berlin and I was doing this in
4:16 in Dresden there's a big Max Planck
4:18 Institute for cell biology there where I
4:21 did the first half of my postdoc and
4:23 ostensibly my job was to um do applied
4:26 mathematical modeling to model cell
4:29 cellular biological phenomena
4:32 um at this point my colleagues
4:34 biologists were able to collect
4:36 increasing amounts of of data up to
4:39 millions of rows and and Beyond if
4:41 they're doing genomics and that type of
4:42 stuff at this point I'd done a bunch of
4:44 programming but I didn't really have a
4:46 strong statistical data bent to myself
4:49 and this is over a decade ago now so it
4:52 became clear that to do my job it would
4:55 be a good idea to learn as much as
4:57 possible about what was becoming data
5:00 science at that point so I started
5:03 playing around with rstudio um and then
5:04 in IPython notebooks so and at that
5:07 point there weren't Jupiter notebooks
5:09 um but so I started to learn all the
5:11 tools that I needed to analyze and model
5:14 data and cell biological phenomena
5:18 um then my postdoc boss moved to the
5:21 east coast of the US to Yale University
5:23 and so I worked there with him for a
5:25 couple of years and in both these jobs I
5:28 mean I love the research
5:30 um but it became clear to me that
5:34 there are lots of good researchers
5:37 um right but there was a gap at both
5:39 these places in terms of actually
5:40 teaching these tools to all the
5:41 biologists and all the scientists I mean
5:43 I worked with tenured professors at Yale
5:45 who really
5:46 um didn't have
5:48 um the computational skills to do the
5:51 science that they needed a wonderful
5:53 scientists and experimentalists
5:55 um
5:56 and nor did they really have the time or
5:58 or the bandwidth so I mean the incentive
6:00 system is is pretty screwy there as well
6:02 so I carved out time in the department I
6:04 was working in in order to teach what I
6:06 called like practical data science for
6:08 researchers and scientists workshops
6:12 um at that point I met
6:16 um
6:16 uh some young entrepreneurs who'd
6:19 started uh the company data Camp
6:22 um and they had built out a pretty
6:24 serious base R curriculum
6:26 um and they were looking for someone to
6:29 come in and build build out python
6:31 courses and do a bunch of product and
6:33 internal data science stuff and and that
6:35 type of stuff
6:36 um and I was applying for academic
6:38 positions at the time applying for some
6:39 industry positions and as it turned out
6:43 um you know it it I I was able to jump
6:45 in and start really building up python
6:46 python courses there and very fortunate
6:48 to be able to not only build out courses
6:52 um that I could teach myself but
6:54 collaborate at that point with what was
6:56 then Continuum analytics is now Anaconda
6:58 of course to build out like the first
7:00 set of pandas and matplotlib courses and
7:03 to work with Andreas Muller of psychic
7:05 learn on the first psychic learn course
7:07 and so really getting a huge amount of
7:10 insight into the open source world and
7:12 being able to collaborate with a bunch
7:14 of these really interesting
7:17 um in insightful uh tool Builders and
7:19 practitioners as well
7:21 um
7:22 I started doing
7:24 we'll get to why I did this soon when
7:27 we're talking about kind of getting into
7:29 developer relations and getting into
7:30 developer advocacy I started doing a
7:32 bunch of developer relations advocacy
7:34 then
7:35 um
7:36 a lot of writing speaking online live
7:39 coding sessions
7:42 um and started a podcast called Data
7:43 frame which I think some people probably
7:44 have listened to
7:46 um and that was that was a huge amount
7:48 of fun once again getting to do stuff
7:51 like this I mean talk with people who
7:53 I'm interested in about stuff that we're
7:55 both interested in and and and having
7:57 conversations with an audience about
7:59 that so a lot of community building
8:00 there
8:01 um so after data Camp I've been in
8:04 several places
8:07 um I first was a a company called coiled
8:10 which
8:12 um is a dask company so dask is for
8:15 distributed parallelized compute um in
8:18 in in Python
8:20 um and I was doing a lot of evangelism
8:22 developer relations marketing stuff
8:23 there and more recently for the past uh
8:26 year and a half
8:29 um although I've been working with them
8:30 for for longer I'm really excited to be
8:32 working at out of bounds where we're
8:34 working on the full stack of machine
8:36 learning and as we'll get to I I think
8:38 um one of the big challenges here as is
8:41 as I think as is becoming should be
8:43 becoming clear
8:45 um
8:46 I think something I love doing is
8:48 helping scientists get access to tools
8:50 software tools and education and content
8:53 that helps them do better science right
8:57 um and what does that mean in Industry
8:59 now we're trying to tell the
9:00 productionization story of data science
9:02 and machine learning more and get that
9:04 out of larger organizations I mean meta
9:06 and Google know how to do machine
9:08 learning at scale Netflix knows how to
9:10 do machine learning at scale how do we
9:12 get that into you know Mom and Pop
9:14 e-commerce stores and how do we get that
9:16 across across the board and what does
9:18 this full stack look like and how do we
9:20 build software and education so that
9:22 scientists can do this in any company
9:25 and they don't need to worry about you
9:28 know configuring yamls and kubernetes
9:30 clusters right so how do we build a
9:33 stack of infrastructure that allows
9:34 scientists to focus on the top of the
9:37 stack the modeling the data the things
9:38 they love the productionization without
9:40 having to become the most robust intense
9:43 software Engineers although as you and I
9:44 have discussed these skills are
9:46 important as as well
9:49 um and I also I've put a link to this in
9:50 the chat I host a podcast as well called
9:52 Vanishing gradients and the reason
9:54 behind that
9:56 was actually
9:57 um
9:58 you know after I did the data frame
10:00 podcast the datacamp I always wanted to
10:02 get back into podcasting and I it was in
10:05 between jobs that I taught a lot of my
10:07 friends work in the space and I was
10:08 having what I thought were a lot of
10:09 interesting conversations with them so I
10:12 thought
10:12 why not record them and and put them out
10:15 there so it's it's really nice I get to
10:17 have conversations like this with
10:18 friends and put them out so definitely
10:20 check that out for for those interested
10:24 Google decided YouTube decided that it's
10:27 spam so your link did not go through but
10:31 I just Googled it and posted in the live
10:33 chat fantastic yeah it's funny because I
10:36 also in my job at out of bounds we host
10:39 um Fireside Chats around full stack
10:41 machine learning and I have noticed that
10:43 um only I as host can post things but
10:46 yeah I still don't know how exactly it
10:49 works sometimes people can post links
10:51 sometimes they cannot most of the time
10:54 they're not so only if the cost can
10:55 which I guess makes sense like people
10:58 made comments
11:00 I'm really wondering so like the quilt
11:03 the quilt is the company behind dusk
11:06 outer bounds is the company become
11:08 behind metaphor why not call the company
11:10 like dusk or metaphor why do you come up
11:13 with this names that sound completely
11:16 unrelated
11:17 that's a good question
11:19 um
11:20 so I suppose the way I frame it is that
11:23 other people work on these open source
11:25 projects right so
11:27 um meta flow for example has 75
11:29 um historical contributors on
11:32 um on on GitHub right
11:35 um
11:36 and other companies as well so I would
11:40 say out of bounds is the company that
11:42 probably
11:43 um you you would consider supporting
11:46 um meta flow a lot just as coiled
11:49 supports task
11:50 um having said that um I think Anaconda
11:52 still employs a bunch of gas
11:55 um maintainers as a bunch of
11:58 contributors for task work in a variety
12:01 of other companies as well
12:02 um and I think that's actually really
12:04 important right because if we think
12:07 about what open source is it's a pretty
12:09 broad Church
12:10 um and
12:12 if you think about something like
12:15 tensorflow which is you know think about
12:17 governance of tensorflow where isn't it
12:19 isn't open source in the classical sense
12:22 of you know how many people get to make
12:24 decisions it's very company company back
12:27 so I do think
12:28 um it's important to have that
12:30 distributed also there's the converse in
12:34 that for
12:35 companies institutions to adopt open
12:37 source I think
12:40 we want to make sure that a certain
12:42 number of companies support them as well
12:44 so I definitely before coiled started um
12:48 there were companies that were like when
12:49 considering dask versus spark are like
12:52 well spark has more support in industry
12:55 and from data breaks and that type of
12:56 stuff so we want to just make sure that
12:57 dask has is supported by a handful of
13:00 places
13:01 um first as well so I think there's a
13:03 there's an interplay there and now speak
13:05 to the fact that having these companies
13:07 can actually really support the open
13:08 source ecosystem
13:10 okay interesting so it's on purpose that
13:13 the name of the company and the product
13:15 they work on are not the same in it yeah
13:17 because they are different entities
13:19 right and out of bounds although we
13:21 support metaflow and work on metaflow
13:23 and um have a managed offering as a
13:26 product and these types of things
13:28 um definitely what we want to help
13:30 people do is solve
13:32 um machine learning and take machine
13:34 learning from prototype to production
13:36 and improve that um speed of iteration
13:38 there
13:39 um and whether we do that through
13:40 metaflow or not isn't necessarily the
13:43 primary concern we happen to it
13:45 currently
13:46 do you work on anything else a partial
13:48 metaphor
13:50 look at the other posts
13:52 so no at the moment our main product is
13:55 definitely based around metaflow but it
13:57 it does interoperate with a variety of
14:00 different things right so if you're on
14:02 AWS we make sure that you can have
14:05 access to all of your resources all of
14:07 your data and have that secured uh in
14:10 AWS if you
14:12 um use kubernetes clusters we make sure
14:14 you can do that um I think something I
14:16 showed on the OSS demo Spotlight the
14:19 other day was um uh we integrate with
14:22 the Argo scheduler so when you want to
14:24 push your models to production you can
14:26 do that using Argo
14:28 yeah so we support like a huge kind of a
14:32 section of the ecosystem yeah and when
14:35 you were talking about your career
14:37 Journey that's that was pretty
14:39 interesting so you came to develop
14:41 relations through education so you first
14:45 notice that for researchers it's
14:48 difficult to learn about practical data
14:50 science so you did a bunch of courses
14:52 there and then you joined datacam and
14:55 then through that you became a developer
14:58 relation and I'm wondering how this
15:00 transition happened like was it natural
15:02 for you as a teacher as an educator to
15:05 go there or like how exactly did it
15:08 happen how did you make this decision
15:09 that okay actually you know what what
15:11 I'm doing seems to be close to devrel
15:14 let me do this professionally
15:17 yeah it's a good question I I suppose
15:20 one way of thinking about it and this
15:22 isn't the only way but that devrel kind
15:24 of is it education right that uh that
15:29 someone who works in developer relations
15:30 their their job is to at least create
15:33 educational content that helps people
15:35 use you use software so it definitely
15:38 was natural in in that sense
15:42 um the other reason it was natural for
15:45 me I think
15:47 as I said a lot of the other things I've
15:49 I've done I think
15:51 um there are lots of people who are
15:53 really good at these things and actually
15:55 think there are lots of people who could
15:57 be good at devrel we just haven't carved
15:58 out the career paths for them so
16:01 um I suppose it was a differentiator for
16:02 me and I could I could make more impact
16:04 then in in Endeavor or than than than
16:07 other other positions so and I think key
16:12 aspects
16:13 for those wanting to get into devrel are
16:15 of course to enjoy and be good at the
16:18 computational side and understand the
16:20 data science and machine learning
16:22 although there are things you know they
16:24 say that you know the best teacher
16:26 sometimes is someone who's just learned
16:27 what they're what they're teaching so if
16:29 you have definitely a background in
16:30 these things and want to pick things up
16:32 and teach them that that can be useful
16:34 but yeah to have a have a have a command
16:36 of
16:37 um
16:38 you know the technical scientific side
16:40 of things and then the other thing is to
16:43 be an explainer
16:45 um so I I mean when I walk down the
16:48 street I'm having my morning coffee and
16:49 I've done something I my mind naturally
16:52 gravitates to hack to explaining that in
16:54 my own head in kind of
16:56 um as straightforward terms as possible
16:59 um and I have colleagues and friends who
17:00 don't operate that way right I know a
17:03 lot of Engineers who like they just want
17:05 to build cool product not just they want
17:07 to build cool product and they don't
17:09 want to write blog posts
17:10 um and they and they don't really want
17:12 to break things down and that's totally
17:14 cool if that's you I wouldn't
17:16 necessarily get into the the devrel side
17:18 of things but if you enjoy explaining
17:21 things and you enjoy the technical side
17:23 of things I definitely think um
17:27 I think there's a there's a hiring
17:29 challenge in devrel generally
17:31 um and I think that's going to increase
17:33 I think the demand side of the labor
17:35 market for devrel is going to grow as we
17:37 get more and more tools like people like
17:39 am I going to be replaced by GPT 23 or
17:44 whatever right and I've got no idea but
17:47 what I can tell you is that working in
17:49 devrel I think definitely there's
17:52 a significant chance of being employable
17:55 um for a long time I'm not saying
17:57 there's less chance in other other
17:58 fields but I definitely think that the
18:01 pie is growing if that makes sense but
18:03 what is actually deprel what is it
18:07 it's a good question
18:08 um
18:10 I think the best way to think about I
18:12 mean there are multiple terms that
18:14 fly around there's developer relations
18:17 there's developer advocacy there's
18:19 evangelism
18:21 um the way I think about it is
18:24 um we can think about open source or not
18:26 open source software it doesn't doesn't
18:28 really matter it's helping developers
18:32 understand how to use software and and
18:36 why essentially
18:38 um so
18:39 in my current job as I said there are
18:43 and this is something we talked about
18:45 um earlier this week
18:46 um there are you know scientists who are
18:49 great on the data and modeling side side
18:51 of things and they need to understand
18:52 certain things about compute versioning
18:56 code versioning models
18:59 um about orchestration all of these
19:01 these types of things so a devil
19:03 function there would be in the name of
19:05 Education to give them access to the
19:09 information they need about these tools
19:11 but also
19:12 um to resources for how to learn it and
19:15 how to implement it and that speaks to
19:18 the the sandbox that I that I demoed at
19:20 the spotlight as as well as we discussed
19:22 you know getting set up with this entire
19:24 infrastructure stack is is days of work
19:26 so if you can you know do devrel
19:30 um
19:31 in the name of education but have these
19:33 tools that allow people to spin things
19:35 up in 10 seconds instead of 10 days
19:38 um that's incredibly useful another way
19:41 to think about and this is actually one
19:43 of the reasons one of the several
19:45 reasons I joined metaflow and out of
19:46 bounds the co-founders when I first
19:48 spoke with them they showed me some
19:50 slides on what they referred to as the
19:51 wisdom layer of of meta flow
19:54 um and Ville toolos who you know
19:57 um and who is the CEO of out of bounds
19:59 and used to run machine learning
20:01 infrastructure at Netflix where they
20:02 develop uh meta flow
20:04 um
20:05 will I said to me you know this the
20:08 software of course is incredibly
20:09 important but the reason we want to hire
20:12 devrel immediately is because the wisdom
20:14 layer is it's not secondary it's equally
20:17 as as important and I think recognizing
20:19 that
20:21 um is key I'll give maybe two other
20:23 examples
20:25 um psychic learn
20:28 um one of I mean it's wonderful software
20:31 but I think one of the most important
20:34 reasons for its huge adoption is its
20:36 documentation
20:38 um and documentation of course is part
20:39 of devrel not in only in terms of
20:41 documenting you know methods and
20:43 arguments and Doc strings and this this
20:45 type of stuff but giving easily
20:48 accessible SEO findable examples
20:53 um that that people can then use in in
20:55 their day jobs
20:57 um I think the Tidy verse in the our
20:58 ecosystem is the same the way our
21:00 original the Tidy verse originally with
21:02 ggplot d player several other packages
21:05 had vignettes carrot the carrot
21:07 vignettes that Max developed I'm on
21:10 the machine learning stuff is absolutely
21:11 absolutely wonderful so all of these
21:14 roll in into devrel
21:16 um and I'm I'll I'll shush in a second I
21:19 did want to mention the other thing I
21:21 just used the term SEO right search
21:23 engine optimization
21:25 um and this is actually incredibly
21:26 important so what we're seeing now is
21:28 that devrel is related to Marketing in
21:31 some way right
21:32 um and the cynical take on this is that
21:34 developers don't trust marketing so you
21:36 need to invent a new function called
21:38 something else
21:39 um kind of like no it's nothing like
21:41 this but I was thinking Edward Bernays
21:43 who um
21:44 he he coined the term public relations
21:47 because the term propaganda had a bad
21:51 name
21:52 um so it he coined the term that's
21:53 propaganda for propaganda
21:56 um but that's the cynical take uh what's
21:58 really happening there I I think is that
22:02 um the tools devrel needs to to get
22:05 to the Right audience are some of the
22:07 same tools marketers marketers do so
22:10 there was there's a joke and like in for
22:12 open source a lot of Open Source
22:14 developers that stat when you search
22:16 something about their package stack
22:18 Overflow
22:20 comes up first even though it's answered
22:23 in their documentation so a lot of the
22:24 time people will just link to the stack
22:27 Overflow answer with documentation and
22:28 spell it out there so that's to say you
22:31 also in devrel and I'm trying to entice
22:33 people to think more about devrel
22:35 um you get to do a bunch of fun stuff
22:36 you get develop content go and give
22:38 talks chat with developers also fold
22:41 developer feedback back into software
22:43 and product and also learn about the
22:46 internet and search engines and all of
22:49 this type of type of fun stuff as well
22:51 yeah interesting so it's about education
22:54 it's about discoverability and it's
22:57 about
22:59 producing content that developers can
23:01 understand and developers can trust
23:03 right so as you said like if it's just
23:06 somebody from marketing department
23:09 then maybe they don't necessarily
23:11 believe that this person speaks the same
23:13 languages as them right and speaking
23:16 about marketing so I'm curious usually
23:19 is developer relations
23:22 a part of the marketing department or
23:25 the part of the technical department
23:27 um
23:28 it depends on the organization I've seen
23:33 both
23:35 um I've spent most of my time in recent
23:38 years working in
23:39 early stage to Middle stage startups and
23:43 what's interesting in in in my two most
23:46 recent startups is we've hired deveral
23:49 people before
23:51 um like
23:52 full-time marketers right so I think for
23:55 an early to medium stage startup you can
23:56 get away with you know having the devil
23:58 people do all the marketing as well as
24:01 you scale and grow
24:03 um you're going to want to you know have
24:05 a pretty serious marketing team and you
24:07 can either have
24:08 um some of the developerations people in
24:11 there or or an independent unit as well
24:13 it depends on how you want to structure
24:14 things
24:15 um it is always interesting when devrel
24:17 reports into the CTO and is as close to
24:19 engineering as possible
24:21 um in my current
24:23 company at out of bounds we're pretty
24:26 non-hierarchical
24:28 um so I'm pretty generative so that's
24:32 actually the other thing worth worth
24:34 mentioning
24:35 um
24:37 devrel is also not just about like
24:39 creating content yourself out of the
24:41 abstract but it's leveraging and
24:43 collaborating with your engineers to see
24:47 what they can bring to the world and
24:48 lowering the barrier to entry for them
24:50 so who's the best person to write
24:52 documentation of a new feature it's not
24:54 me it's the engineer who who built the
24:57 feature right but in perhaps in
24:59 collaboration with me depending on them
25:01 perhaps we can write something together
25:02 or if they're not into writing at all
25:04 maybe I'll jump on a call with them like
25:06 this talk it out get a transcript then I
25:08 draft something from that so it's really
25:10 it's fun because you have all these
25:12 touch points internally in a project
25:14 um and also externally with the
25:16 developers who use it so yeah I think
25:18 you mentioned that not all developers
25:21 are really into writing blog posts and
25:24 other things or million talks but then
25:28 other developers who need to use the
25:32 tools that these developers produce
25:34 they need documentation they need to
25:36 know how to actually use this site and
25:38 then somebody needs to make this happen
25:40 right and then it's you it's Deborah
25:42 exactly make sure that okay even if
25:45 maybe the developer wrote something
25:48 is it actually understandable then I
25:51 take this documentation this piece of
25:52 documentation and do something with this
25:54 or it's completely or maybe not
25:57 completely but there are some missing
25:58 things there are some areas for
26:00 improvement there are some unclear parts
26:01 that could be improved right and then
26:03 you give this feedback to developers or
26:05 maybe go ahead and just you know improve
26:07 these things exactly sound right okay
26:10 yeah and the other thing worth
26:11 mentioning is but also it's fun because
26:14 you get to study professionally on top
26:16 of current trends so you know recently
26:18 we've seen
26:19 I suppose what we call a revolution in
26:22 generative AI from you know last year
26:24 all your stable diffusions and these
26:27 types of stuff to all like the large
26:28 language model stuff happening now
26:31 um so when when that occurs in a company
26:34 in a project you want to figure out you
26:36 know how you can support these these
26:38 efforts more generally and because at
26:40 metaflow we really think about how to
26:42 the how to imp how to get machine
26:45 learning and data science in real world
26:47 software stacks and in robust
26:49 reproducible applications
26:52 um and of course all the generative Ace
26:54 AI stuff is really built around proof of
26:56 Concepts and not robust software it's
26:58 been a lot of fun to um to to start
27:01 working on that type of stuff and I'll
27:02 I'll link to a few blog posts of kind of
27:04 how we're thinking about supporting the
27:07 infrastructure that allows people to
27:09 build all this generative AI stuff as
27:12 well that I think your audience will
27:13 find interesting so yeah it keeps you on
27:15 top of current trends as well which is
27:16 cool
27:17 okay so we already discussed that you as
27:20 a developed person work closely with the
27:23 developers who create a product who
27:25 create the code
27:27 how closely do you work with marketing
27:29 because like what marketers do in my
27:31 opinion I might be wrong so they are
27:33 usually in charge of different campaign
27:35 campaigns so they might run I don't know
27:38 ads on Google they might run they might
27:41 work with communities to advertise
27:43 something through these communities or
27:45 they might create an event and then see
27:47 how well this event performs so they are
27:49 not necessarily into the actual content
27:52 but rather than making sure that this
27:54 content
27:55 reaches the right people so how do you
27:59 work with this marketers with these
28:01 people
28:04 I guess you produce content but then
28:06 they make sure that this content is uh
28:11 discoverable like people find it
28:13 absolutely and so it's usually an
28:17 iterative process and there are many
28:20 many different examples of weister
28:21 slices but I think um thinking so part
28:25 of a marketing team's job is to make
28:27 sure a company appears or a product or a
28:30 piece of Open Source software appears in
28:32 places where people
28:34 um will be looking for it right and so
28:37 as it turns out at the moment search
28:39 engines are really important for that
28:42 right so you want to make sure that when
28:45 you have a digital marketer that they're
28:47 aware of who your ideal customer is or
28:50 ideal user and can help you
28:53 um
28:54 you know figure out what type of
28:55 searches they make and getting you in
28:56 front of their eyes
28:57 um with with relevant relevant stuff now
28:59 as you've ascertained it's
29:03 the devrel team among other potential I
29:06 mean there are content marketers as well
29:07 but the the devil the technical people
29:09 who develop content
29:11 um that digital marketers will be able
29:13 to use in order to to get that you know
29:17 search engine stuff stuff happening so
29:19 there's a serious back and forth there
29:21 where you know perhaps the engineering
29:24 team and the devrel
29:26 um tell the marketers these are the
29:28 types of things we're thinking writing
29:29 about then the marketers will do their
29:31 SEO research and come back and go okay
29:34 this has High
29:36 um search traffic but we're actually
29:39 really competitive with Google itself
29:41 for this right so maybe we won't win
29:44 that whereas this has medium traffic but
29:46 it's something that
29:48 um is is super relevant and not a lot of
29:50 people are going for it at the moment so
29:52 it's an ongoing conversation in in that
29:55 sense
29:56 um and I'll I'll definitely say
30:00 it's
30:02 there are a lot of very good marketers
30:04 out there but not necessarily a lot of
30:06 great marketers who understand the
30:08 technical
30:10 um space Who would know what XG boost is
30:13 for example or the difference between
30:15 um you know uh gradient boosting and
30:18 other forms that's not their job right
30:20 exactly
30:23 um so the way I think about it is that
30:25 devrel is kind of the marketing team's
30:28 best friend in in a lot of ways so the
30:30 more they can can work together the the
30:33 better off and then when you know
30:36 um even developing at at some point
30:38 perhaps a project or a company will want
30:42 to have a conference that you know the
30:44 marketing team is responsible for
30:46 putting together
30:47 um then devrel will play a significant
30:49 role in in constructing kind of the lay
30:51 of the land for who they invite what
30:53 actually happens there what type of
30:54 talks whether they're panels this this
30:56 this type of stuff as well
30:59 um because marketers can organize a
31:03 conference but they don't necessarily
31:04 know which content will appeal better to
31:08 the to the audience item that's your
31:10 input for that exactly cool um but I
31:12 also want to say there are some pretty
31:13 technical marketers as well so there are
31:16 some
31:17 I've met some wonderful product
31:19 marketers who their job is to I mean and
31:21 they're usually from somewhat technical
31:23 backgrounds who know how to
31:26 um speak speak the technical technical
31:27 talk as well so I don't want to say no
31:29 Market is a computational or anything
31:30 like that but they're not as easy to to
31:33 find
31:34 yeah probably we should invite one of
31:37 those Forks to our podcast yeah
31:40 absolutely but what are the skills that
31:43 let's say I work as a data scientist and
31:45 I want I am interested in exploring that
31:48 that product space I I think I enjoy
31:51 writing I think I enjoy giving talks and
31:55 I've heard that devrel being a devil is
31:57 about that so I kind of want to go into
32:00 that space into that direction so what
32:03 kind of skills do I need for that well I
32:06 think you you have a wonderful skill set
32:08 Alexi for for devil because you do it I
32:11 mean the other thing that I probably
32:12 didn't speak to enough is that devrel is
32:15 about community building and this is
32:16 something you do
32:17 a huge amount of right so it isn't only
32:19 about
32:21 like one-to-many broadcast mode and then
32:24 many to one it's about getting all the
32:25 connections between the community
32:28 um in interacting
32:30 um so I think as I said before
32:33 um the most important skills are having
32:36 a base of technical skills that you can
32:39 can leverage there are always things you
32:41 can learn on the fly as well
32:44 um a willingness and a like a strong
32:46 desire to learn more things and if
32:48 you're working in data science and
32:49 machine learning
32:50 successfully you probably already have
32:52 that right because things are moving so
32:54 quickly so neither of these things are
32:56 really
32:58 special in in this skill set per se in
33:01 in this audience
33:03 um and then a desire to an ability to
33:07 explain things in in simple terms
33:11 um and to community build as as well so
33:15 enjoying having these kind of like
33:18 you know multi-network conversations
33:22 um between engineers and developers and
33:24 data scientists and people doing machine
33:26 learning and that type of stuff
33:29 okay so in summary technical skills
33:33 right so if I order you work as a data
33:34 scientists I got that covered but then
33:37 in addition to that I need to know how
33:39 do I actually explain my work it's not
33:42 just okay I finished my Jupiter notebook
33:43 I don't know right
33:47 put this to meta flow to productionizer
33:49 type and then my job is done then I
33:52 actually
33:54 once and I can explain how these things
33:57 work and I enjoy doing this then
33:59 probably I would be a good fit for a
34:02 developed position absolutely and in a
34:04 variety
34:06 like media right so
34:08 um being a relatively good writer
34:12 um I think is is important
34:15 um as is you know enjoying going out
34:18 there speaking doing videos podcasts
34:20 such as this
34:21 as well
34:22 okay so it's was it related to community
34:27 building aspect or something a bit
34:29 different yeah I would say the community
34:31 building as well because what you want
34:33 to do is be able to you know take
34:36 information and techniques and and
34:38 methods and bring them to a broader
34:40 community and get the community
34:41 discussing getting feedback from the
34:42 community for the project as well
34:47 um how do I become yeah I'm sorry I was
34:50 just going to say the other thing worth
34:52 mentioning
34:54 um and this is always a challenge for
34:58 for a lot of data scientists and machine
35:00 learning Engineers who are thinking of
35:01 getting into devrel it's not clear in a
35:04 lot of organizations once you get into
35:07 devrel you get to do a lot of cool data
35:09 science and machine learning projects
35:11 but they're more for uh content and
35:13 developer relations as opposed to solve
35:15 internal business problems so that's
35:18 something that you have to give up to a
35:21 certain extent there's a trade-off there
35:23 depending on the organization there may
35:25 be a structure which allows you to do
35:27 internal data science as well but if
35:28 you're working on the data science team
35:29 you're also working on the data science
35:31 team and not the devrel team right so
35:32 they're they're kind of they can be
35:34 mixed incentives when you're in
35:35 reporting into two different teams as
35:37 well
35:38 um so you definitely get to do less
35:40 impactful internal data science when
35:43 working in devrel but as part of that
35:45 trade-off you get to do all these all
35:46 these fun things we're talking about
35:49 so does it mean that you kinda
35:52 you get less in-depth knowledge into
35:56 certain things because when you solve a
35:58 business problem and I don't know like
36:00 there are some problems
36:03 or like some things don't work and then
36:05 you start digging deeper until you
36:07 figure this out and then this is how you
36:09 learn and then like you become efficient
36:11 in
36:12 using in
36:14 at some domain or in some with some
36:17 library but as a devrel whose focus is
36:22 on creating educational content maybe
36:24 you don't necessarily dig that deep as a
36:27 yeah you still end up dog fooding a lot
36:30 of things that you're You're Building
36:31 though and you also um you know in order
36:34 to get to the point where something
36:36 works for you and is reproducible you've
36:38 got to make it reproducible for other
36:39 people as well so you can end up getting
36:42 pretty seriously in in the weeds can be
36:44 even more difficult right like this
36:46 reproducibility
36:48 yeah absolutely yeah I remember like one
36:52 thing is when you do this at work you
36:54 commit and then it's
36:55 it's working fine but then the other
36:58 thing if you want to actually teach
37:00 others how you did this and then it's a
37:03 totally different thing and then you'll
37:05 notice that wait a wait a minute like
37:07 most of these things are more complex
37:09 than they should be how about they try
37:11 to rewrite them and then like you spend
37:13 a week doing this
37:19 absolutely
37:21 well you mentioned that in order to
37:25 become a good devrel you need to be a
37:27 good writer and you also need to be a
37:30 good speaker but how do I become a good
37:32 writer if I'm if these are scientists
37:35 like is it something I'm born with and I
37:38 either have it or not or something I can
37:41 become better at
37:43 well
37:44 I mean nurture on nature right this is
37:46 this is the age-old question and I'm I'm
37:49 probably a Bayesian at heart so I think
37:51 I think framing the conversations around
37:53 likelihoods is the the most useful way
37:56 of thinking about it so
37:58 I think um
38:00 like some people are naturally good at
38:02 writing and explaining and that type of
38:04 stuff but that it's also because people
38:06 enjoy it more so people have done more
38:08 of it and that type of stuff but I think
38:10 anyone where there's a will there's a
38:12 way as we say
38:13 um so anyone who wants to become a good
38:16 writer um can I I do think
38:20 um the way you do it is by by doing it
38:24 um of course there are courses you can
38:25 take but I think by actually trying to
38:28 explain things trying to write things
38:29 down
38:30 um if you get some form of writer's
38:32 block you know you can record yourself
38:33 talking through something then get a
38:36 transcript of that these and these types
38:38 of things well have a con try to explain
38:39 it to someone get a transcript of that
38:43 um I think one of the
38:45 the best ways to become a writer to to
38:48 improve your writing skills well there
38:50 are two one is to collaborate with other
38:51 people
38:52 um and work and with Google Docs or
38:54 whatever it is these days notion pick
38:56 your tool right
38:57 um uh collaborative writing is is in a
39:02 wonderful State the other is by by
39:04 reading more
39:06 um and and I think noticing what you
39:10 like about what you're reading what
39:12 you're not noticing when you read
39:13 something and you don't understand
39:15 something I think
39:18 I think a lot of us have a tendency to
39:20 think that's our fault
39:22 um like I'll be like am I too dumb to
39:23 understand what and then I go no
39:25 actually like I'm dumb in some ways but
39:28 not in this way and this probably isn't
39:30 written like they haven't explained it
39:31 well and trying to figure out what they
39:32 haven't necessarily explained well and
39:34 then how I do it differently and so
39:36 those those types of things I think are
39:37 incredibly important but um I definitely
39:40 think through through writing you become
39:42 a good writer and it is a huge
39:44 differentiator man I mean I
39:46 I was very surprised when I started
39:48 working in cell biology and
39:51 the number of
39:54 like incredible research scientists and
39:56 I won't name any names or institutions
39:58 but the number of really amazing
40:00 scientists who don't know how to write
40:02 properly
40:04 um and I and I mean maybe because their
40:06 minds on other things as well but
40:07 they'll share what they call final
40:09 drafts with things that like the
40:10 sentences aren't complete right
40:14 um so I think it is a really strong
40:16 differentiator there as well yeah what
40:19 helped me is uh
40:22 having added an editor who would point
40:24 out hey look this paragraph is
40:28 completely not understandable I tried to
40:31 read it three times I still don't get it
40:33 but work on this paragraph to really
40:35 understand what you meant here and let's
40:37 try to the right of in simple sentences
40:40 without all these passive voice longer
40:43 constructions break it down so that was
40:46 helpful and what I did later in
40:50 is working with data scientists actually
40:53 kind of do the same thing like when they
40:55 submit the draft
40:57 say okay look this sentence is a bit
40:59 confusing can we make it clearer and
41:02 that is very helpful for both right and
41:05 then at the end make sure that the
41:07 readers actually understand so and one
41:10 thing you mentioned about the writer
41:12 block
41:12 and I used to have it until chargpt came
41:16 out so now it's much easier to get
41:20 started so I just asked hey like I want
41:22 to write something about that can you
41:24 give me like I don't know an outline
41:27 outline and then like okay now I already
41:30 have some things they are not
41:33 necessarily good right and then I can
41:34 enter it on this thing and then
41:36 ask something so that that's very
41:39 helpful I never tried speaking to myself
41:41 and recording it and then transcribing I
41:44 think it's a very good idea
41:46 yeah and I do I Journal a lot as well so
41:48 I do that with with journaling sometimes
41:49 when I just
41:50 too tired to write I'll just you know I
41:53 think I got the idea from Twin Peaks I
41:54 don't know if anyone's seen that TV show
41:55 but um Dale Cooper the Kyle McLaughlin
41:58 character dictates his diary into a
42:00 Dictaphone in the 90s
42:02 well I think now with all these tools
42:04 from open AI it's uh you can just
42:07 dictate something to your phone then
42:10 transcribe it and then have uh dpt4
42:13 summarize it in an article and then like
42:16 we already have a graph to start with
42:19 and then start working it working with
42:22 on your with your own style with your
42:24 own extra content yeah that's amazing I
42:28 actually recently used whisper I
42:31 attended
42:32 parents evening in school it was in
42:35 German my German is not very far from
42:37 perfect
42:38 I did not understand everything but I
42:40 record this and then I put this into
42:43 whisper and then I took the output of
42:45 whisper and put it to GPT and then you
42:47 just summarized everything and then I
42:49 thought wow and then I asked it to
42:50 translate from German to English
42:53 amazing that's so cool
42:57 yeah sorry I just noticed Hannah had a
42:59 couple of questions in the in the chat
43:01 that that are really relevant to
43:04 how how to approach
43:06 with me did them oh yes of course yes
43:09 that's
43:10 Johanna who helps us in Melbourne right
43:13 yeah and she's doing this now online
43:16 thanks so the question Johanna has is
43:20 how do you approach creating ease of
43:21 writing or tutorial do you start with
43:24 structure or you have some other
43:25 approach
43:27 pretty early depending on
43:31 whether I'm collaborating with people or
43:33 doing it myself sometimes by myself I'll
43:35 just start writing I have an idea and
43:36 start writing I think when
43:38 when collaborating with people getting a
43:41 structure down beforehand is is very
43:44 important just to align so you make sure
43:46 you're quote unquote like rowing in the
43:47 right right in the same direction
43:50 um but I think before structure is
43:53 figuring out who your target audience is
43:56 and then what your goals are right
44:00 so let's say I wanted to write something
44:06 um about you know using whisper with
44:09 metaphor right so how to build
44:11 production software
44:13 um that transcribes uh audio let's say
44:17 leveraging kubernetes clusters or
44:18 something something like that right so
44:21 I could start drafting drafting that or
44:23 write a structure but
44:25 the structure might be incredibly
44:27 different based on whether I'm writing
44:29 it for a data scientist or
44:32 um a platform engineer right like if I'm
44:34 writing for a platform engineer maybe
44:36 they want to know about how to configure
44:39 all the kubernetes Clusters in order for
44:42 the data scientists to be able to do
44:43 their work as quickly as possible
44:44 whereas if I'm writing it for a data
44:46 scientist or machine learning engineer
44:48 perhaps we're abstracting over all that
44:50 information
44:51 um so I think that is in incredibly
44:55 incredibly important
44:57 um in terms of goals
45:00 um I think
45:01 for a company or an open source project
45:04 perhaps
45:07 you know you want to start asking
45:09 questions before writing a structure am
45:11 I
45:12 am I writing this to just build
45:15 awareness of this open source software
45:17 or am I doing it in order to support
45:20 people who already use it right or am I
45:24 doing it
45:25 um for credibility in the space or am I
45:29 doing it to generate excitement right
45:33 um and so I think these all of these
45:35 types of different questions are
45:37 important to figure out what your goal
45:39 are target audience then start
45:41 structuring it
45:43 um and then move through it and one
45:45 thing I'd sometimes do is when I write a
45:47 structure I essentially write what the
45:49 tldr shouldn't should look like
45:51 beforehand
45:53 um and then write down what the headings
45:54 are what the H2S are that that break it
45:57 up and then start filling things out and
45:59 if you're collaborating then you can you
46:01 know figure out who wants to write which
46:02 part and then edit for each other and
46:04 and that type of stuff so yeah those are
46:07 kind of General ways that I've started
46:09 to think about
46:10 and how do you understand what kind of
46:13 goal you have like maybe somebody comes
46:16 to you and says hey we don't have any
46:18 blocks in our blog post and we don't
46:21 have any blog posts in our blog
46:24 let's create blog posts and then you're
46:26 okay let's create and then you think you
46:28 can like what is my goal actually
46:33 and the way I think about that is
46:37 blog posts are there to serve goals of
46:39 projects or companies right
46:42 um and and the audience right whoever
46:44 the audience may it may be
46:47 um so
46:49 if
46:51 an open source project wants to start a
46:53 blog
46:54 um if they don't have a large audience
46:56 yet the I suppose the first thing they
46:58 want to do is develop awareness right
47:01 that's why they're why they're doing
47:02 this blog as opposed to
47:04 [Music]
47:06 um let's say
47:09 that they want blog posts because there
47:11 are too many issues on the issue tracker
47:13 which are solved
47:14 um but they need blog posts to point
47:16 people to
47:18 um to say hey this is the solution to it
47:20 right so then that's a that's a
47:21 different thing so I would even push
47:24 back and say you shouldn't create a blog
47:27 out of a vacuum right for no reason
47:29 um if you're creating content
47:31 um there is a goal embedded in in your
47:34 logic
47:35 um and so it's my job to figure out what
47:37 your what your goal is so a very
47:40 different example
47:42 um is
47:44 I speak with a lot of Founders who want
47:46 to kind of find things out about early
47:48 stage devrel and a question that
47:50 Founders founders of companies Venture
47:52 back seed rounds series a companies who
47:55 um
47:57 a question they're they're building
47:58 developer tools a question they almost
48:01 always ask if they don't have one
48:03 already is should I should we have an
48:05 open source offering
48:08 um between you know what already exists
48:10 and and our product and my question is
48:12 why why do you want to do that
48:15 um and a lot of the time they say it's
48:18 for community building and my response
48:20 to that is well it's an option then but
48:22 there are other ways to build community
48:24 as well so once we get back to the goal
48:26 maybe writing blog posts isn't the way
48:28 to solve your business problem or what
48:30 your project needs the pain point at
48:32 that point so root causing the desire
48:34 and then generatively thinking through
48:37 the potential options and blog posts
48:39 will usually form part of it but then
48:40 you've got that goal as part of that
48:42 process as well yeah and to
48:45 speaking of that like if you your goal
48:47 is building awareness
48:49 then you can do it through an article
48:51 through a conference talk or through a
48:54 YouTube video or through a thousand
48:56 other ways things like how do you
48:59 actually select the right medium like if
49:01 the company comes to you and says hey
49:03 write a blog post for us
49:05 should you challenge that and say like
49:07 maybe for this you should just the
49:10 conference talk because there will be
49:11 like I don't know uh 1000 or 2000
49:15 developers watching this talk maybe we
49:17 should do that instead of an article
49:19 yeah I think um not to seem too
49:22 businessy about it but it's just a
49:24 shorthand I mean you look at the return
49:25 on investment right the ROI
49:28 um and I do think you want several
49:31 strategies and you want to make
49:33 hypotheses and then do experiments
49:36 around those hypotheses and then figure
49:37 out if they they worked or not right and
49:39 the truth is because search engines have
49:41 such high Roi you are going to want to
49:43 do blog posts that are indexable by
49:45 Google and yeah being these days maybe
49:49 um whatever it is right
49:51 um but conference talks are incredibly
49:53 important and I think also like
49:56 low-hanging fruit of organizing meetups
49:58 and that type of stuff in terms of
49:59 community building and developing
50:01 awareness or sponsoring meetups I do
50:05 that's a good question now where
50:07 returning to like a lot of in-person
50:09 conferences and and that type of stuff
50:12 whether you want to go and do in-person
50:13 conferences because let's say you fly
50:16 across the country in let's say you're
50:18 in the US and you live on the west coast
50:20 go into a conference on the east coast
50:22 is and that's you know in the end days
50:25 of travel and hotels and and that type
50:26 of stuff is that as impactful as doing a
50:30 set of virtual conferences right which
50:31 you can to do in an afternoon so
50:35 thinking through those things
50:37 is super important I do think there's
50:40 and this is this is one of those things
50:42 that's unquantifiable man right like
50:44 what happens when you're in a room with
50:47 with people right and the conversations
50:49 that that happened then and just like
50:50 having a coffee with someone and those
50:52 types of things so the hallway track at
50:54 conferences is in-person conferences is
50:56 so important so I think there is value
50:58 there but it's not necessarily as
51:00 quantifiable which which is tough
51:02 yeah that's them for me personally the
51:04 most interesting part of the conference
51:06 is not the actual talk
51:08 but what happens before and after you
51:11 know all this yeah
51:14 I always wondered whether we could just
51:17 ideally we could just remove all the
51:19 talks right yeah
51:23 all right yeah like you could say people
51:26 watching beforehand or watch them after
51:28 or something like that but it's it's
51:30 almost an excuse It's a proxy to get
51:33 people together even though everyone
51:35 knows that's not the reason
51:37 they're there right but if you didn't
51:39 have it they wouldn't travel
51:42 yeah right I understand
51:46 yeah well I see that we have a few
51:48 questions and uh one question from Ella
51:50 is about the role of the pro whether
51:54 it's inter-company or intercompany
51:56 because it's somebody who speak more
51:59 outside or within the company or it's
52:02 both or
52:03 or that's such a good
52:06 question
52:08 um
52:10 it should be both
52:12 yeah
52:13 um
52:16 at the moment
52:17 where I work a lot of it is external and
52:20 that's because internally we're
52:22 relatively small so internally everyone
52:25 knows what's what what's going on right
52:29 um like have a lot of domain expertise
52:31 for the most part whereas
52:34 um
52:35 when you go to a certain size and you
52:37 start hiring a marketing team a sales
52:40 team
52:42 um devrel actually has an incredibly
52:44 important function in getting
52:46 um resources internal to get everyone up
52:49 to speed with what the company does and
52:51 and what they think if you can as devrel
52:53 if you can educate your sales team your
52:55 account Executives and Business
52:57 Development representatives and all of
52:59 these different roles if you can educate
53:00 them on the software and product even
53:03 more so that they can talk to talk even
53:04 if they can't walk the walk there are
53:06 huge huge returns there
53:08 um so I think it's both depend but it
53:12 just dependent on the on on the size of
53:14 the company
53:15 um the other thing worth mentioning is
53:16 it's between companies as as well right
53:19 um because
53:22 of the state of full stack machine
53:23 learning and that essentially what's
53:26 required at the moment and what's best
53:28 practice is um a suite of interoperable
53:30 best of breed tools as opposed to
53:33 all-in-one platforms you know at
53:35 metaflow
53:36 um we interoperate with a bunch of
53:38 experiment trackers such as weights and
53:40 biases and and common right
53:43 um so I get to work with these great
53:45 people I um I did a fireside chat
53:47 yesterday with um the head of product
53:49 and a co-founder at tabula who work on
53:52 Iceberg which is out of Netflix as well
53:53 just like just like metaflow
53:55 um and we're we're working on some blog
53:57 posts showing how
53:59 um tabular can work with metaflow to do
54:03 really high high throughput uh machine
54:05 learning from there from parque through
54:08 through to Iceberg sorry through to
54:11 metaflow so it's really really fun to
54:13 work with a variety of different
54:14 companies in in the space as well
54:18 so it's external internal and
54:22 in their company because internal could
54:24 be you work with other companies or
54:26 external could be you educate
54:29 developers right so it's both exactly
54:32 um and the other the other thing worth
54:34 mentioning is that you know at a company
54:37 you know that's 10 to 20 people you end
54:40 up doing a variety of different things
54:41 but as a company grows you people become
54:43 more specialized right specialized right
54:45 have a better off for Worse becoming
54:48 increasingly specialized like I love
54:51 I think I get bored easily so I love
54:53 doing a variety of different different
54:55 things so maybe that's why I'm attracted
54:57 towards early to Middle stage startups
55:00 um the other thing that I didn't didn't
55:01 mention and it's not necessarily part of
55:03 the skill set for devrel but starting
55:05 you don't need anything major but start
55:07 working on a portfolio make sure your
55:10 GitHub repository is is is looking nice
55:14 um
55:14 you know write some blog posts and maybe
55:16 publish them on
55:18 towards data science
55:21 um you know go give a talk at a local
55:23 Meetup before proposing something for a
55:25 conference find some of the cool work
55:27 you're doing internally wherever you
55:29 work and try to bring that to the world
55:30 and and see how it feels as well
55:34 um experiment with your career right so
55:36 like maybe you start giving talks in
55:38 like I don't really enjoy that
55:40 um but you enjoy all the other parts of
55:42 devrel and that means if you're
55:43 interested in applying for devil
55:45 position you can say hey
55:46 I don't really enjoy giving talks that
55:47 much but this is what I I I I can offer
55:50 so experiment with what works for you
55:53 maybe now I add the Shameless like if
55:56 any of you who's listening and data
55:58 scientist or a mobile engineer or deep
55:59 engineer and you work on solvents and
56:02 business problem and you want to talk
56:04 about that
56:05 there is a Meetup
56:07 or Meetup where you can do this so
56:09 retails
56:11 amazing yes well you also have a podcast
56:14 and we still have three minutes maybe
56:17 you can tell us about that podcast
56:20 before we finish
56:21 yeah so it's actually this was an idea
56:25 that I had
56:28 when I was building a lot of courses
56:31 um and and and con technical content for
56:34 developers it was there isn't
56:37 necessarily a lot of room When
56:39 developing this stuff for long format
56:40 conversations around what the industry
56:43 actually looks like on on the ground
56:46 um and because you know a lot of my
56:48 friends as I said a lot of my colleagues
56:49 work in this place doing a lot of
56:51 interesting stuff I have a lot of these
56:52 conversations all the time
56:54 um and there are a lot of challenges in
56:56 in the space that it is an obvious from
56:58 when you look at KD nuggets or go to
57:01 open data science conference or Pi data
57:03 or look at towards data science right
57:06 um so I wanted to kind of have a space
57:09 for for me and like-minded people to
57:11 have kind of longer longer conversations
57:14 um and so it is pretty across the board
57:16 it's called Vanishing gradients and it's
57:18 on
57:19 whatever app you use I think it should
57:21 be if it isn't please please let me know
57:24 um but you know I've had people from
57:27 T-Mobile from Pfizer
57:30 um and and Novartis
57:33 um uh data scientists from from Twitter
57:35 and and Reddit
57:37 um Facebook so a number of different
57:40 places and each episode is kind of
57:41 themed in in in some way as as this
57:44 podcast is
57:46 um but I suppose if you enjoyed this
57:48 conversation and you want to see what
57:49 happens when the tables are turned when
57:51 I'm interviewing
57:52 um someone else
57:54 um you can really get get a sense of
57:55 what the space uh looks like on on the
57:58 ground as well
57:59 um and I'd really welcome your feedback
58:00 on it if it resonates or what you'd like
58:02 to hear more of also
58:04 um and you it's it's URL we've included
58:06 but it's vanishinggradients Dot
58:08 fireside.fm
58:11 open and we will make sure to include
58:13 these links in the show notes in the
58:16 description so if you listen to this
58:18 podcast and recording you will find them
58:21 so
58:23 um what's the best way to find you
58:26 on LinkedIn or Twitter
58:28 um and it's Hugo Brown Anderson of
58:30 course on LinkedIn and it's at Hugo
58:32 bound b-o-w-n-e
58:35 um and the other place if you're
58:37 interested we can share the link as well
58:41 um if you're interested in the full
58:42 stack machine learning stuff that we're
58:44 doing at out of bounds um we've got a
58:46 slack where you can come and chat with
58:48 us as well and that's
58:49 slack.outabounds.com and we'll include
58:51 that in the show notes Co not Kong yes
58:55 exactly yeah that's like I think it's
58:58 I would put com let me usually
59:02 okay I think that's all we have time for
59:04 today thanks everyone for joining us
59:05 today
59:06 thanks a lot to you Huga personally for
59:11 checking all your experience with us
