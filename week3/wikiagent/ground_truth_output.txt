QUESTION 1/10: where do capybaras live?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
Capybaras, the largest living rodents, are native to **South America**, where they inhabit a variety of environments. These animals prefer areas close to **bodies of water**, including rivers, lakes, swamps, and marshes, which are essential for their semi-aquatic lifestyle. They are often found in **savannas** and **dense forests**, thriving in wetlands and tropical rainforests throughout South America, except for **Chile**.

They are social animals, commonly living in groups of around 10 to 20 individuals, although larger groups of up to 100 can congregate during dry seasons around available water sources. Capybaras are also known to adapt well to environments modified by humans, often seen flourishing in cattle ranches and even urban areas where water is accessible. Their capability as swimmers aids in their survival, enabling them to evade predators by submerging themselves in water for extended periods, up to five minutes at a time [Capybara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capybara).

QUESTION 3/10: when was the first computer invented?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
The invention of the first computer is often attributed to Charles Babbage, who designed the Analytical Engine in the 1830s. Babbage's machine is considered to be the first concept of a general-purpose mechanical computer. The Analytical Engine included key features of modern computers, such as an arithmetic logic unit, control flow through conditional branching and loops, and memory. However, it was never fully constructed during his lifetime.

Another significant early computing device was the Z3, created by Konrad Zuse in 1941, which is considered the world's first working electromechanical programmable computer. Zuse's Z3 used binary arithmetic and was capable of being programmed using a punched film.

The first fully electronic digital computer, known as ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), was completed in 1945. It was designed to perform complex calculations for the United States Army during World War II and became operational after the war.

QUESTION 7/10: when did World War II end?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
World War II officially ended in two phases:

1. **In Europe**: The war concluded with the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany on **May 8, 1945**, which is celebrated as **Victory in Europe Day (V-E Day)**. The surrender was formalized when Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel signed the German Instrument of Surrender in Berlin. Although the fighting continued for a few days after this date, it marked the official end of hostilities in Europe.

2. **In Asia**: The formal end of World War II occurred after Japan's surrender on **September 2, 1945**. This surrender followed the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 and the Soviet declaration of war against Japan. The surrender was signed aboard the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay, officially marking Japan's capitulation and the end of the war in the Pacific Theater.

The overall dates signify that while the war in Europe ended in May, the global conflict did not conclude until September 2, when Japan surrendered, officially finalizing the end of World War II worldwide.

QUESTION 9/10: who discovered penicillin?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
Penicillin was discovered by Scottish physician and microbiologist **Alexander Fleming** in 1928. Fleming's breakthrough occurred while he was working at St Mary's Hospital in London. He observed that a mold (later identified as *Penicillium notatum*, now known as *Penicillium rubens*) had contaminated one of his bacterial culture plates. This mold inhibited the growth of the surrounding bacteria, leading Fleming to hypothesize that it released an antibacterial substance, which he named "penicillin" [1][2].

Although Fleming identified penicillin, it wasn't until the late 1930s and early 1940s that its potential was realized through the efforts of Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and their team at the University of Oxford. They developed techniques for mass production and purification of penicillin, making it widely available for medical use, particularly during World War II, where it played a crucial role in treating infections and saving countless lives [1][3].

In recognition of their contributions to the development of penicillin, Fleming, Florey, and Chain were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945 [3][4].

QUESTION 10/10: what is the speed of light?
================================================================================

ANSWER:
The **speed of light in vacuum**, often referred to as simply the speed of light, is a universal physical constant denoted by \( c \), which is exactly **299,792,458 meters per second** (approximately \( 300,000 \) km/s or \( 186,282 \) miles per second). This value is exact due to the way the meter is defined in relation to the speed of light: one meter is defined as the distance light travels in vacuum in \( \frac{1}{299,792,458} \) of a second.

The speed of light is crucial in physics because it serves as the ultimate speed limit for the transmission of information, energy, and matter according to the theory of relativity. All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, travels at this speed in vacuum. In materials such as glass or water, light travels slower due to interactions with the medium, which is characterized by the material's refractive index [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).

To summarize, the speed of light in a vacuum is:
- **Exact value**: \( 299,792,458 \, \text{m/s} \)
- **Approximate values**:
  - \( 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)
  - \( 186,282 \, \text{miles per second} \) [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light).
