It returns a \"drift detected\" or \"not detected\" result.\n\nThere is a default logic to choosing the appropriate drift test for each column.

This ROC AUC is compared to the ROC AUC of the random classifier at a set percentile. To ensure the result is statistically meaningful, we repeat the calculation 1000 times with randomly assigned target class probabilities. This produces a distribution with a mean of 0.5. We then take the 95th percentile (default) of this distribution and compare it to the ROC-AUC score of the classifier. If the classifier score is higher, we consider the data drift to be detected. You can also set a different percentile as a parameter.\n</Info>\n\nIf the drift is detected, Evidently will also calculate the\u00a0**top features of the domain classifier**.

You always need to pass two datasets: current (dataset evaluated for drift) and reference (dataset that serves as a benchmark).\n\n**Non-empty columns**. To evaluate data or prediction drift in the dataset, you need to ensure that the columns you test for drift are not empty. If these columns are empty in either reference or current data, Evidently will not calculate distribution drift and will raise an error.\n\n**Empty values.** If some columns contain empty or infinite values (+-np.inf), these values will be filtered out when calculating distribution drift in the corresponding column.\n\n<Note>\n  By default, drift tests do **not** react to changes or increases in the number of empty values. Since the high number of nulls can be an important indicator, we recommend running separate tests on share of nulls in the dataset and/or columns. You can choose from several [tests](/metrics/all_metrics#column-data-quality).\n</Note>\n\n## Dataset drift\n\nWith Presets like `DatasetDriftPreset()` and Metrics like `DriftedColumnsCount(),`  you can also set a rule on top of the individual column drift results to detect dataset-level drift.\n\nFor example, you can declare dataset drift if 50% of all features (columns) drifted. In this case, each column in the Dataset is tested for drift individually using a default method for the column type. You can specify a custom threshold as a [parameter](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n\n![](/images/metrics/preset_data_drift_2-min.png)\n\n## Tabular data drift\n\nThe following defaults apply for tabular data: numerical and categorical columns.\n\nFor **small data with \\<= 1000 observations** in the reference dataset:\n\n* For numerical columns (n\\_unique > 5): [two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://en.wikipe",

Key results will include:\\n     - Column drift, which displays changes in individual columns.\\n     - The overall dataset drift indicating the proportion of drifting columns.\\n   - By default, a dataset is considered to have drifted if at least 50% of its columns show drift.\\n   \\n4. **Respond to Detected Drift**:\\n   - If drift is detected, you can:\\n     - Trigger re-evaluation of the model.\\n     - Pause or switch decision-making methods until the drift is addressed.\\n     - Implement a retraining workflow if necessary to ensure the model continues to operate effectively.\\n\\n5. **Customization Options**:\\n   - Customize your models by adjusting detection methods, thresholds, or implementing custom drift detection logic as required. Different examples and metrics like PSI, K-L divergence, or Wasserstein distance are available depending on the type of data you are working with.\\n   \\nThe Evidently library provides the flexibility to monitor different types of data (numerical, categorical, text) and allows you to fine-tune your drift detection strategy as needed based on your production environment

        "content": "To effectively monitor data drift in production using Evidently, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare Your Data**:\n   - Ensure that you have two datasets available: \n     - A **current dataset** that captures the data at present.\n     - A **reference dataset** that serves as a benchmark to compare against.\n   - Make sure that your datasets contain no empty columns as the calculations will fail if they do.\n\n2. **Setup Data Drift Detection**:\n   - Utilize the `DataDriftPreset` in your Reports when running evaluations in Evidently:\n   ```python\n   from evidently.report import Report\n   from evidently.pivot import DataDriftPreset\n\n   report = Report([\n       DataDriftPreset(),\n   ])\n   result = report.run(current, reference)\n   ```\n   - The `DataDriftPreset` will automatically select the most appropriate drift detection methods based on the type of data and quantity of observations.\n\n3. **Run Evaluations and Interpret Results**:\n   - After running the report, review the output to see if there's any drift detected. Key results will include:\n     - Column drift, which displays changes in individual columns.\n     - The overall dataset drift indicating the proportion of drifting columns.\n   - By default, a dataset is considered to have drifted if at least 50% of its columns show drift.\n   \n4. **Respond to Detected Drift**:\n   - If drift is detected, you can:\n     - Trigger re-evaluation of the model.\n     - Pause or switch decision-making methods until the drift is addressed.\n     - Implement a retraining workflow if necessary to ensure the model continues to operate effectively.\n\n5. **Customization Options**:\n   - Customize your models by adjusting detection methods, thresholds, or implementing custom drift detection logic as required. Different examples and metrics like PSI, K-L divergence, or Wasserstein distance are available depending on the type of data you are working with.\n   \nThe Evidently library provides the flexibility to monitor different types of data (numerical, categorical, text) and allows you to fine-tune your drift detection strategy as needed based on your production environment requirements.",
