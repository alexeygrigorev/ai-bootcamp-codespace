You always need to pass two datasets: current (dataset evaluated for drift) and reference (dataset that serves as a benchmark).\n\n**Non-empty columns**. To evaluate data or prediction drift in the dataset, you need to ensure that the columns you test for drift are not empty. If these columns are empty in either reference or current data, Evidently will not calculate distribution drift and will raise an error.\n\n**Empty values.** If some columns contain empty or infinite values (+-np.inf), these values will be filtered out when calculating distribution drift in the corresponding column.\n\n<Note>\n  By default, drift tests do **not** react to changes or increases in the number of empty values. Since the high number of nulls can be an important indicator, we recommend running separate tests on share of nulls in the dataset and/or columns. You can choose from several [tests](/metrics/all_metrics#column-data-quality).\n</Note>\n\n## Dataset drift\n\nWith Presets like `DatasetDriftPreset()` and Metrics like `DriftedColumnsCount(),`  you can also set a rule on top of the individual column drift results to detect dataset-level drift.\n\nFor example, you can declare dataset drift if 50% of all features (columns) drifted. In this case, each column in the Dataset is tested for drift individually using a default method for the column type. You can specify a custom threshold as a [parameter](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n\n![](/images/metrics/preset_data_drift_2-min.png)\n\n## Tabular data drift\n\nThe following defaults apply for tabular data: numerical and categorical columns.\n\nFor **small data with \\<= 1000 observations** in the reference dataset:\n\n* For numerical columns (n\\_unique > 5): [two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://en.wikipe",

You should pass these datasets as **reference** and **current**. Evidently applies several statistical tests and drift detection methods to detect if the distribution has changed significantly. It returns a \"drift detected\" or \"not detected\" result.\n\nThere is a default logic to choosing the appropriate drift test for each column. It is based on:\n\n* column type: categorical, numerical, text data \n\n* the number of observations in the reference dataset\n\n* the number of unique values in the column (n\\_unique)\n\nOn top of this, you can set a rule to detect dataset-level drift based on the number of columns that are drifted.\n\n## Data requirements\n\n**Two datasets**. You always need to pass two datasets: current (dataset evaluated for drift) and reference (dataset that serves as a benchmark).\n\n**Non-empty columns**. To evaluate data or prediction drift in the dataset, you need to ensure that the columns you test for drift are not empty. If these columns are empty in either reference or current data, Evidently will not calculate distribution drift and will raise an error.\n\n**Empty values.** If some columns contain empty or infinite values (+-np.inf), these values will be filtered out when calculating distribution drift in the corresponding column.\n\n<Note>\n  By default, drift tests do **not** react to changes or increases in the number of empty values.

The [drift detection method](/metrics/explainer_drift) is chosen automatically based on the column type and number of observations.\n\n* **Target / Prediction Drift**. If you dataset includes Prediction or Target value, it will be evaluated together with other columns.\n\n* **Overall dataset drift.** Returns the share of drifting columns in the Dataset. By default, Dataset Drift is detected if at least 50% of columns drift.\n\nThe table shows the drifting columns first. You can also choose to sort the rows by the feature name or type, and open up individual columns to see distribution details.\n\n![](/images/metrics/preset_data_drift-min.png)\n\nIf you choose to enable Tests, you will get an additional Test Suite view:\n\n![](/images/metrics/test_preset_data_drift-min.png)\n\n<Info>\n  **Data Drift Explainer.** Read about [Data Drift Methods](/metrics/explainer_drift) and default algorithm.\n</Info>\n\n## Use case\n\nYou can evaluate data drift in different scenarios.\n\n* **To monitor the ML model performance without ground truth.** When you do not have true labels or actuals, you can monitor **feature drift** and **prediction drift** to check if the model still operates in a familiar environment. These are proxy metrics. If you detect drift in features or prediction, you can trigger labelling and retraining, or decide to pause and switch to a different decision method.\n\n* **When you are debugging the ML model quality decay.** If you observe a drop in the model quality, you can evaluate Data Drift to explore the change in the feature patterns, e.g., to understand the change in the environment or discover the appearance of a new segment.\n\n* **To understand model drift in an offline environment.** You can explore the historical data drift to understand past changes and define the optimal drift detection approach and retraining strategy.\n\n* **To decide on the model retraining.** Before feeding fresh data into the model, you might want to verify whether it even makes sense. If there is no data drift, the environment is stable, and retraining might not be necessary.\n\n<Info>\n  For conceptual explanation, read about [Data Drift](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-in-production/data-drift) and [Concept Drift](https://www.evidentlyai.com/ml-in-production/concept-drift). To build intuition about different drift detection methods, check these research blogs: [numerical](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/data-drift-detection-large-datasets) data, [embeddings](https://www.evidentlyai.com/blog/embedding-drift-detection).\n</Info>\n\n## Data requirements\n\n* **Input columns**. You can provide any input columns. They must be non-empty.\n\n* **Two datasets**. You must always pass both: the current one will be compared to the reference.\n\n* (Optional) **Set column types**. The Preset evaluates drift for numerical, categorical, or text data. You can specify column types explicitly (recommended). Otherwise Evidently will auto-detect numerical and categorical features. You must always map text data.\n\n<Info>\n  **Data schema mapping**. Use the [data definition](/docs/library/data_definition) to map your input data.\n</Info>\n\n## Report customization\n\nYou have multiple customization options.\n\n**Select columns**. You can apply Drift Detection only to some columns in the Dataset, for example, only to the important features. Use the `columns` parameter.\n\n**Change drift parameters.** You can modify how drift detection works:\n\n* **Change methods**. Evidently has a large number of drift detection methods, including PSI, K-L divergence, Jensen-Shannon distance, Wasserstein distance, etc. You can also pick tests by column.\n\n* **Change thresholds**. You can specify different drift detection conditions on the dataset or column level.\n\n* **Implement a custom method**. You can implement a custom drift method as Python function.\n\n<Info>\n  **Drift detection parameters**. Learn available methods and parameters in [Drift Customization. ](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n</Info>\n\n**Modify Report composition**. You can add other Metrics to the Report to get a more comprehensive evaluation. Here are some recommended options.\n\n* **Single out the Target/Prediction column.** If you want to evaluate drift in the Prediction column separately, you can add `ValueDrift(\"prediction\")` to your Report so that you see the drift in this value in a separate widget.\n\n* **Add data quality checks**. Add `DataSummaryPreset` to get descriptive stats and run Tests like detecting missing values. Data drift check drops nulls (and compares the distributions of non-empty features), so you may want to run these Tests separately.\n\n* **Check for correlation changes**. You can also consider adding checks on changes in correlations between the features.\n\n<Info>\n  **Custom Report**.

It helps detect the distribution drift in the individual columns (features, prediction, or target). This page describes how the **default** algorithm works.\n\nThis applies to: `DataDriftPreset`, `ValueDrift`, `DriftedColumnsCount`.\n\n<Info>\n  This is an explainer page. For API reference, check the guide on [setting data drift parameters](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n</Info>\n\n## How it works\n\nEvidently compares the distributions of the values in a given column (or columns) of the two datasets. You should pass these datasets as **reference** and **current**. Evidently applies several statistical tests and drift detection methods to detect if the distribution has changed significantly. It returns a \"drift detected\" or \"not detected\" result.\n\nThere is a default logic to choosing the appropriate drift test for each column. It is based on:\n\n* column type: categorical, numerical, text data \n\n* the number of observations in the reference dataset\n\n* the number of unique values in the column (n\\_unique)\n\nOn top of this, you can set a rule to detect dataset-level drift based on the number of columns that are drifted.\n\n## Data requirements\n\n**Two datasets**. You always need to pass two datasets: current (dataset evaluated for drift) and reference (dataset that serves as a benchmark).\n\n**Non-empty columns**. To evaluate data or prediction drift in the dataset, you need to ensure that the columns you test for drift are not empty. If these columns are empty in either reference or current data, Evidently will not calculate distribution drift and will raise an error.\n\n**Empty values.** If some columns contain empty or infinite values (+-np.inf), these values will be filtered out when calculating distribution drift in the corresponding column.\n\n<Note>\n  By default, drift tests do **not** react to changes or increases in the number of empty values. Since the high number of nulls can be an important indicator, we recommend running separate tests on share of nulls in the dataset and/or columns. You can choose from several [tests](/metrics/all_metrics#column-data-quality).\n</Note>\n\n## Dataset drift\n\nWith Presets like `DatasetDriftPreset()` and Metrics like `DriftedColumnsCount(),`  you can also set a rule on top of the individual column drift results to detect dataset-level drift.\n\nFor example, you can declare dataset drift if 50% of all features (columns) drifted. In this case, each column in the Dataset is tested for drift individually using a default method for the column type. You can specify a custom threshold as a [parameter](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n\n![](/images/metrics/preset_data_drift_2-min.png)\n\n## Tabular data drift\n\nThe following defaults apply for tabular data: numerical and categorical columns.\n\nFor **small data with \\<= 1000 observations** in the reference dataset:\n\n* For numerical columns (n\\_unique > 5): [two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test).\n\n* For categorical columns or numerical columns with n\\_unique \\<= 5: [chi-squared test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test).\n\n* For binary categorical features (n\\_unique \\<= 2): proportion difference test for independent samples based on Z-score.\n\n<Info>\n  All tests use a 0.95 confidence level by default. Drift score is P-value. (=\\< 0.05 means drift).\n</Info>\n\nFor **larger data with > 1000 observations** in the reference dataset:\n\n* For numerical columns (n\\_unique > 5):[Wasserstein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric).\n\n* For categorical columns or numerical with n\\_unique \\<= 5):[Jensen--Shannon divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%E2%80%93Shannon_divergence).\n\n<Info>\n  All metrics use a threshold = 0.1 by default. Drift score is distance/divergence. (>= 0.1 means drift).\n</Info>\n\n**You can modify this drift detection logic**. You can select any method available in the library (PSI, K-L divergence, Jensen-Shannon distance, Wasserstein distance, etc.), specify thresholds, or pass a custom test. Read more about [data drift parameters and available methods](/metrics/customize_data_drift).\n\n**Exploring drift.** You can see the distribution of each individual column inside the `DataDriftPreset` or using `ValueDrift` metric:\n\n![](/images/metrics/preset_data_drift-min.png)\n\nFor numerical features, you can also explore the values mapped in a plot.\n\n* The dark green line is the **mean**, as seen in the reference dataset.\n\n* The green area covers **one standard deviation** from the mean.\n\n![](/images/metrics/preset_data_drift_3-min.png)\n\nIndex is binned to 150 or uses timestamp if provided.&#x20;\n\n## Text data drift\n\nText content drift using a **domain classifier**. Evidently trains a binary classification model to discriminate between data from reference and current distributions.&#x20;\n\n![](/images/concepts/text_data_drift_domain_classifier.png)\n\nIf the model can confidently identify which text samples belong to the \u201cnewer\u201d data, you can consider that the two datasets are significantly different.\n\n<Info>\n  You can read more about the domain classifier approach in the\u00a0[paper\u00a0](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11953.pdf)\u201cFailing Loudly: An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift.\u201d\n</Info>\n\nThe drift score in this case is the ROC AUC of the resulting classifier.\n\nThe default for **larger data with > 1000 observations** detects drift if the ROC AUC > 0.55. The ROC AUC of the obtained classifier is directly compared against the set ROC AUC threshold. You can set a different threshold as a parameter.\n\nThe default for **small data with \\<= 1000 observations** detects drift if the ROC AUC of the drift detection classifier > possible ROC AUC of the random classifier at a 95th percentile. This approach\u00a0**protects against false positive**\u00a0drift results for small datasets since we explicitly compare the classifier score against the \u201cbest random score\u201d we could obtain.\u00a0\n\n<Info>\n  **How this works.** The drift score is the ROC-AUC score of the domain classifier computed on a validation dataset. This ROC AUC is compared to the ROC AUC of the random classifier at a set percentile. To ensure the result is statistically meaningful, we repeat the calculation 1000 times with randomly assigned target class probabilities. This produces a distribution with a mean of 0.5. We then take the 95th percentile (default) of this distribution and compare it to the ROC-AUC score of the classifier. If the classifier score is higher, we consider the data drift to be detected. You can also set a different percentile as a parameter.\n</Info>\n\nIf the drift is detected, Evidently will also calculate the\u00a0**top features of the domain classifier**. The resulting output contains specific characteristic words that help identify whether a given sample belongs to reference or current. They are normalized based on vocabulary, for example, to exclude non-interpretable words such as articles.\n\n<Tip>\n  **Text descriptors drift**. If you work with raw text data, you can also check for distribution drift in text descriptors (such as text length, etc.) To use this method, first compute the selected [text descriptors](/docs/library/descriptors). Then, use numerical / categorical drift detection methods as usual.\n</Tip>\n\n\n## Resources\n\nTo build up a better intuition for which tests are better in different kinds of use cases, you can read our in-depth blogs with experimental code:\n\n* [Which test is the best?
